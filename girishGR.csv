But this book will prepare you for your journey towards learning more about day-trading. If day-trading is a universe you are looking to explore then, definitely this book is one of the places you won't regret visiting. Once you are here, you'll realize the divergence in the mindset of a trader and an investor. Novices to technical analysis will find themselves a bit lost however since for the purposes of brevity this book won't explain what is MACD? or what is ATR? or what is RSI? Andrew would leave you on your own to figure that out. I would recommend that you make yourself aware of the nuances of technical analysis before you begin reading this book. <br/><br/>I'm sharing my notes from this book here, you may now stop reading this review if you don't want the spoilers. However go ahead if you'd like a gist of what this book talks about:<br/><br/><b>Risk Management</b><br/><br/>Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.‚Äù<br/><br/><b>You must avoid stocks that:</b> <br/><br/>(1) are heavily traded by computers and institutional traders, <br/>(2) have small relative trading volume, <br/>(3) are penny stocks and are therefore highly manipulated, and <br/>(4) don‚Äôt have any reason to move (no fundamental catalysts).<br/><br/><b>Three-Step Risk Management</b><br/> <br/>Step 1: Determine your maximum dollar risk for the trade you‚Äôre planning (never more than 2% of your account). Calculate this before your trading day starts.<br/><br/>Step 2: Estimate your maximum risk per share, the strategy stop loss, in dollars, from your entry. This comes from the strategies set out in Chapter 7, where I explain in each strategy what the stop loss should be.<br/><br/>Step 3: Divide ‚Äú1‚Äù by ‚Äú2‚Äù to find the absolute maximum number of shares you are allowed to trade each time.<br/><br/>For Example:<br/><br/>Step 1: Let's say my trading capital is Rs 1,00,000. Accordingly, the 2% rule will limit my risk on any trade to Rs 2,000. <br/><br/>Step 2: Using my strategy I can estimate the maximum risk per share. This number is calculated as Buy Price - Stop Loss. Assuming that this number is Rs 20 for my example.<br/><br/>Step 3: Rs 2,000 / Rs 20 = 100 shares. I can safely trade 100 shares in this case.<br/><br/>‚ÄúRemember, you can always risk less, but you are not allowed to risk more than 2% of your account under any circumstance.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúTrading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúA key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally. Their confidence and peace of mind are connected to their trading results. When traders do well, they feel good. When they encounter losses, they become discouraged, doubtful, and frustrated, questioning themselves, their strategy, and their career. Instead of dealing directly and constructively with their losses, they react to the emotions triggered by personalizing the events.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúSuccessful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money. Almost all professional traders hide their unrealized Profit and Loss (P&L) column while in a trade. They have no interest in seeing how much they are up or down. They focus on the perfect execution of a profit target or a stop loss level. Consistently profitable traders take every negative or positive trade they make as an opportunity to improve themselves.‚Äù<br/><br/>Note: LEARN HOW NOT TO TAKE THINGS PERSONALLY.<br/><br/>Physical and Mental Health are important. Eat well balanced nutritional meals, exercise, maintain body weight, fitness levels, get adequate rest.<br/><br/>‚ÄúOne of the fundamentals you must learn from this book is that every day trading strategy comes with a stop loss level and you must stop out from stocks that trade against your strategy.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúMany traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies, and did not violate any trading rules. ‚Äù<br/><br/><b>How to Find Stock for Trades</b><br/><br/>""You are only as good as the stocks you trade.""<br/><br/><b>Stocks in Play</b><br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ A stock with fresh news<br/>	‚Ä¢ A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open<br/>	‚Ä¢ A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity<br/>	‚Ä¢ A stock that develops important intraday levels which we can trade-off from<br/><br/><b>Fundamental Catalysts</b><br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ Earnings reports<br/>	‚Ä¢ Earnings warnings/pre-announcements<br/>	‚Ä¢ Earnings surprises<br/>	‚Ä¢ FDA approvals/disapprovals<br/>	‚Ä¢ Mergers/acquisitions<br/>	‚Ä¢ Alliances/partnerships/major product releases<br/>	‚Ä¢ Major contract wins/losses<br/>	‚Ä¢ Restructurings/layoffs/management changes<br/>	‚Ä¢ Stock splits/buybacks/debt offerings<br/><br/><b>Float and Market Cap</b><br/><br/>‚ÄúTrading low float stocks is very difficult for the new trader. It is difficult to read the direction of their next move and therefore they are very difficult to manage your risk while trading them. I discourage new traders from trading low float stocks. When the new trader is wrong, the loss is such that it wipes out many gains.""<br/><br/>‚ÄúThe second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares. Many of my strategies explained in this book work well on these stocks, especially the VWAP and Support or Resistance Strategies. Medium float stocks that are more expensive than $100 are not popular among retail day traders and I myself avoid them. You usually cannot buy many shares of them because of their high price. Therefore, it is basically useless to day trade them. Leave them for the institutional traders.‚Äù<br/><br/>‚ÄúThe third category of stocks for trading is mega cap stocks like Apple, Alibaba, Yahoo, Microsoft and Home Depot. These are well-established companies that usually have over $500 million in public shares available for trading. These stocks are traded in millions of shares every day. As you may guess, these stocks move only when large institutional traders, investment banks, and hedge funds are buying or selling large positions. Retail traders like us, who typically trade 100 to 1,000 shares, usually cannot move the price of these stocks. Retail traders should avoid these stocks unless there is a good fundamental catalyst for them. From the strategies set forth in Chapter 7, Reversals and Moving Average Strategies usually work well on these stocks. Do not forget though, unless there is a fundamental catalyst, these stocks are being heavily traded by computers and high-frequency traders and are not suitable for retail day trading.‚Äù<br/><br/><b>Pre-Market Gappers</b><br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2%<br/>	‚Ä¢ Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market<br/>	‚Ä¢ Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares<br/>	‚Ä¢ Stocks that have Average True Range of at least 50 cents (how large of a range a stock has on average every day)<br/>	‚Ä¢ There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock<br/>	‚Ä¢ As a rule, I do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out)<br/><br/>‚ÄúA high short interest indicates traders or investors think a stock‚Äôs price is likely to fall. But the challenge with high short interest is that these stocks are more prone to a short squeeze by bullish investors and traders. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers panic and are scrambling to return their borrowed shares, forcing prices to increase quickly and dangerously. You do not want to be stuck short in a short squeeze.‚Äù<br/><br/><b>Real-Time Intraday Scans</b><br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ Have gapped up or down at least $1<br/>	‚Ä¢ Have ATR of more than 50 cents<br/>	‚Ä¢ Have average relative volume of at least 1.5 (the stock is trading at 1.5 times its normal volume)<br/>	‚Ä¢ Have average daily trading volume of at least 500,000 shares<br/><br/>‚ÄúI will also take a look at the sector of stocks. If I have a few stocks in one sector, there is a good chance that these stocks are not in play. They have high relative volume because their sector is under heavy trading by institutional traders. It is important to know that stocks usually trade with their sector. For example, when oil stocks are selling off, almost all of the oil companies sell off. Therefore, it is important to recognize Stocks in Play from the herd. Remember, you are only as good as the stock you trade, so if you are the best trader in the world, but in a wrong stock, you will lose money.‚Äù<br/><br/><b>Indicators on my Charts</b><br/><br/>	1.

I buy 400 shares.<br/>	2. If trade goes in my favor, I add another 400 shares (note that I add into my winning position, not into losing one).<br/>	3. I sell 400 shares in the first target, bringing my stop loss to break-even (my entry point).<br/>	4. I sell another 200 shares in the next target point.<br/>	5. I usually keep the last 200 shares until I am stopped out. I always retain some shares in case the prices keep moving in my favor.<br/><br/>For $50-$100 price range, the author reduces the trade size to 400 shares.<br/><br/>Also, you can enter a trade small, with say 100 shares and then add to your position in various steps.<br/><br/>Never average down losing positions. When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished.<br/><br/>Strategy 1: ABCD Pattern<br/><br/>Strategy 2: Bull Flag Momentum<br/><br/>Strategy 3 & 4: Reversal Trading<br/><br/>Strategy 5: Moving Average Trend Trading<br/><br/>Strategy 6: VWAP Trading<br/><br/>Strategy 7: Support or Resistance Trading<br/><br/>Strategy 8: Red-to-Green Trading<br/><br/>Strategy 9: Open Range Breakout<br/><br/>Remember that the market is always going to be there, you don't need to rush this.<br/><br/><b>Trading Strategy Based on the Time of Day</b><br/><br/>Open: first 1.5 hours<br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ Bull Flag Momentum and VWAP trades tend to be the best strategies for open.<br/><br/>Mid-day:<br/><br/>	‚Ä¢ Market is slow.

Also, in these unprecedented times don't venture out of your home. Take a book and get lost in the world the writer has created for you only to find yourself in a different color. Remember, for the time being, <i>a person who longs to leave the place where he lives is an unhappy person.</i><br/> <br/>There is a kind of goodness that's too mystical to capture in words, therefore a book like <b>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</b> is too unbearable to be reviewed; heart speaks only to praise, only to recapture, only to summarize. And when the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object. A normal book will answer a question, but a good book will ask you a question and then show you all possible answers without attempting to persuade you into choosing anyone. Because the good writer knows that there is no correct choice, and the writer also knows: 'Es muss sein' (""It must be"", in German); choices are not free will but rather an inescapable fate. What we have not chosen we cannot consider either our merit or our failure. ""To rebel against being born a woman seemed as foolish to her as to take pride in it"". Or to state it conversely, we all get to choose our sufferings but suffer we must.<br/> <br/>The premise of this book is veiled behind the question, what shall we choose? Weight or lightness? Through Tomas ‚Äî a womanizer who lives for his work, his wife Tereza, his mistress Sabina, Sabina's lover Franz, and Karenin ‚Äî the dog of Tomas and Tereza, the writer investigates what it means to choose either of weight or lightness. And why shall humans be reduced to imagination and fiction to learn the answer to binary questions like that? Why should one read a novel to answer such a simple but hard question? The writer answers: <i>There is no means to test which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? Any schoolboy can do experiments in the physics laboratory to test various scientific hypotheses. But man, because he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to follow his passion or not.</i><br/> <br/>If we choose the weight, then the writer argues that the heaviness of the burden can crush us by pinning us to the ground. We sink beneath the burden. And yet the heaviest of burden is simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. <i>The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly beings, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant. We believe that the greatness of man sterns from the fact that he bears his fate as Atlas bore the heavens on his shoulders.</i> <br/> <br/>If we choose lightness, then the writer argues that <i>history is as light as individual human life, unbearable light, light as feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow. What happened but once might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.</i> <br/><br/>Franz denounces his wife, his entire public life behind to spend the rest of his days with Sabina. On waking up the next day he finds out that Sabina has left him for she cannot be pinned to the burden of being with someone in both her public and private life. She had always chosen lightness. The writer captures the plight of Franz with: <i>She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.</i> <br/> <br/>One day when Tomas returns from work he finds that Tereza has left for Prague, leaving him behind in Zurich all alone: <i>For seven years he had lived bound to her, his every step subject to her scrutiny. She might as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. He soared. He was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.</i> <br/> <br/>The writer paints the relationship of Tomas and Tereza with this beautiful prose:<br/><blockquote><br/>In spite of their love, they had made each other‚Äôs life a hell. The fact that they loved each other was merely proof that the fault lay not in themselves, in their behavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their incompatibility: he was strong (lightness) and she was weak (weight). She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of a sentence; she was like her country (Czech), which stuttered, gasped for breath, could not speak. <br/> <br/>But when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave.</blockquote><br/>One of my favorite parts of the book is called: <b>A Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words.</b> The writer explains how seemingly common words bear different meanings for Sabina and Franz. We understand things from where we come from, probably that is what the writer was trying to portray; that we see the world based on our choice for weight or lightness. Sabina chooses lightness, and Franz chooses the weight. Now to say that the characters of the novel made these choices on their own may not be correct.<br/><blockquote><br/>The characters in my novel are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It is that crossed border (the border beyond which my own ""I"" ends) which attracts me most. For beyond that border begins the secret the novel asks about. The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the trap the world has become.<br/></blockquote><br/>Light and Darkness<br/><blockquote><br/>Living for Sabina meant seeing. Seeing is limited by two borders: strong light, which blinds, and total darkness. Perhaps that was what motivated Sabina's distaste for all extremism. Extremes mean borders beyond which life ends, and a passion for extremism, in art and in politics, is veiled longing for death.<br/> <br/>Darkness attracted Franz as much as light. Darkness was pure, perfect, thoughtless, visionless; the darkness was without end, without borders; the darkness was the infinite we carry within us. (Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!)<br/> <br/>But for Sabina, darkness did not mean infinity; for her, it meant disagreement with what she saw, the negation of what was seen, the refusal to see.<br/></blockquote><br/>Living in Truth<br/><blockquote><br/>What does it mean to live in truth? Putting it negatively is easy enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating.<br/> <br/>Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses everything. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. That is why Sabina did not suffer in the least form having to keep her love secret. On the contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.<br/> <br/>For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barrier between the private and the public. He was certain that the division of life into private and public spheres is the source of all lies.<br/></blockquote><br/> <i>Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used. Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of other. But it was too late now.</i><br/> <br/>In the part called Grand March, the writer introduces us to Kitsch. A German word that today in English means something of a poor taste because of excessive garishness or sentimentality. The writer defines the term a little differently: Kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence.<br/> <br/>The writer begins by attacking the literal shit: <i>The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation. Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in which case don't lock yourself in the bathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner.</i> And then swiftly moves to the figurative shit: <i>Kitsch is the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements.</i> This is one of his scintillating qualities, to discuss an idea in one dimension, and then apply it over a story stretching on geography and timeframes. At the beginning of the part, you'd wonder why is he talking about it, but by the time you reach the end of the part you'd bite your nails in astonishment.<br/><br/>With Kitsch, Kundera mocks Soviet society. Soviet society has made such progress that the basic conflict was no longer between good and evil but between good and better. The greatest conflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers' misunderstanding; he thought she no longer loved her. But in the final scene, they would fall into each other's arms, tears of happiness trickling down their cheeks.<br/> <br/>There is another interesting prose which I just cannot resist sharing.<br/><blockquote><br/>We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under. <br/> <br/>The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, in other words, for the look of the public. <br/> <br/>The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. They are happier than the people in the first category, who, when they lose their public, have the feeling that the lights have gone out in the room of their lives. This happens to nearly all of them sooner or later. People in the second category, on the other hand, can always come up with the eyes they need.<br/> <br/>Then there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation of people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the room will go dark.<br/> <br/>And finally, there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of people who are not present. They are dreamers.<br/></blockquote><br/>Karenin is the dog of Tomas and Tereza. Tomas brings Karenin home so that Tereza would have someone to love when he would be away. Although Karenin is a female dog, she had been named after the husband of Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy's book, In Tereza's eyes, books were the emblems of a secret brotherhood). Karenin later develops cancer, and on her deathbed she unites Tomas and Tereza with her smile, reminding each of them, what they have left behind to be in each other's company. Tomas has abandoned his obsession with womanizing and work and discovered that true happiness with Tereza. Tereza had learned what does it mean to love selflessly. <i>It is completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to lover her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company.‚Äù</i><br/><br/>Read Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being at your own risk.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Mike Gayle wants to become a real functioning adult. He has spent thirty-six springs being mastered by his circumstances, and he promises himself to master his circumstances within one revolution of the mother earth around her brightest star. He does what a man in his circumstance must do. He makes a list that stands between him and the real functioning adult club, and then he spends an year ticking off that extravagantly large list. With constant cheerfulness and candidness he overcomes all the hurdles that the list throws at him. There are moments when he feels that he has had it enough, moments when he fails to see the point behind this stupendous pursuit. But time and again, with the help of his wife Claire, with the help of his two daughters, and  with the help of his friends he comes out with blazing guns and finishes the list by ticking 99%+ tasks (entire list is 1277 items long). <br/><br/>This book is more about experiencing the process rather than expecting the destination. You know from the start that the story is going nowhere, and it was never supposed to go anywhere. There are not many high's and low's in this book, but there are lot of moments of laughter, and moments of joy, and moments of inspiration. In this candid tale, there is everyday life: family and friendship, overcoming obstacles, growing up, taking risks and learning about the things you are really capable of.<br/><br/>I could relate to Mike Gayle on so many levels, and whenever I meet someone whom I can relate with on multiple levels, I try to get to know them a little more. So, that is why I decided to read this book, after having an cathartic experience reading his book, All The Lonely People. I'll see you with the next book Mikey xD.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/><b>2.02 p.m.</b> I am wishing that someone would invent a machine that would just do the things that you want it to do without you having to get involved with any of it.<br/><br/><b>2.05 p.m.</b> I've just repeated my invention wish to Claire. She tells me I've already got one: 'It's called a wife and it's how ninety per cent of the things that need doing in our house actually get done.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Now before you judge the man, instead of laughing it off on this little joke. The man crossed the Atlantic just to bring a $12 dollar mug for his wife which she absolutely loved, although which he had broken few years ago. Haha. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

44525305,The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company,Robert Iger,"Iger, Robert",Joel Lovell,,,5,4.4,Random House,Hardcover,272,2019,2019,01/04/21,04/01/21,,,read,"When I finished reading this book last night, my first reaction was: 'Oh my god! This was such a treat. Why did it end so soon?'. I thought about Disney, the company behind some of my cherished childhood memories. And then I thought about the man who was behind running this amazing company. My thought train took me almost a decade back, when I first set my foot on Hong Kong Disney Land. I remember being mesmerized by the Disney parade, I was grooving, dancing, smiling, happily forming memories I was going to carry with me now for about a decade. These legendary fictional characters of Disney are just as alive as you and me. That's what this company is in business of: making characters and stories that stay alive, even long after all of us are gone. Who said it was going to be easy running a company like that? <br/><br/>The Ride of a Lifetime is the collection of very small things that Robert has learned in a very long span of time, and it's great. As his boss used to say, and Robert and I both agree: ""great"" is often a collection of very small things. It is an unputdownable guide on leadership, on problem solving, on developing correct attitude, on the need of innovating, and on knowing that long shots are not as long as they seem to be, that leaves you wanting for more. <br/><br/>And that's probably the only complain I have with this book, it leaves me wanting for more. The picture is only half complete. This book dwells little on the flaws of the man, and therefore it makes me little skeptic. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story of Pixar acquisition and the story of Robert becoming number one from number two at Disney. <br/><br/>Here are some of the lines from the book that impressed me:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year!""<br/><br/>""We all want to believe we're irreplaceable. The trick is to be self-aware enough that you don't cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job. At its essence, good leadership isn't about being indispensable; it's about helping others be prepared to possibly step into your shoes-giving them access to your own decision making, identifying the skills they need to develop and helping them improve, and, as I've had to do, sometimes being honest with them about why they're not ready for the next step up.""<br/><br/>""Maybe this is the case for many of us: No matter who we become or what we accomplish, we still feel that we're essentially the kid we were at some simpler time long ago. Somehow that's the trick of leadership, too, I think, to hold on to that awareness of yourself even as the world tells you how powerful and important you are. The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you've lost your way. That may be the hardest but also the most necessary lesson to keep in mind, that wherever you are along the path, you're the same person you've always been.""<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Surround yourself with them.<br/>5. Don't stagnate. Get in shape for your next birthday.<br/>6. Smile. Because you are here, despite circumstances.<br/>7. Reconnect with the nature.<br/>8. Be grateful. Be generous. Give thanks.<br/>9. Live in the moment.<br/>10. Follow your ikigai. If you don't know what your ikigai is, then your ikigai is discovering your ikigai.  <br/> <br/>If this is t00 much to remember than let me try to phrase it in simple words, a good life is having something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you. All you need is meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and there will always be some struggle in your work and your relationships, but remember that struggle is like salt, it's purpose is to make things interesting and adventurous.

As a kid, I loved pretending to be the general of the army of toys I used to lay on my bed. In my mind, I would simulate a war, making toy pieces fight with each other. My army would always win the war. Growing up I realized (especially after learning how to play chess) that in real life it's not possible to win every battle, but we must be prepared. This book is the first step towards your preparation. When I used to follow the games from this book, I used to feel the same adrenaline rush that I would feel like a kid general with his toy army. <br/><br/>I found this book to be really helpful in understanding chess openings and middlegames. This book tries to instill the thought process behind making each move in this game intuitively. It helped me study queen's pawn openings that I feared playing as black like Queen's Gambit and Colle System. <br/><br/>If you decide to read this book, then I recommend that you follow the games on a chessboard or use an application like <i>Stockfish</i>. I preferred to follow the games on <i>Stockfish</i>, it makes it way easier to navigate and refer to the games in the future. You can even test all the variations that the author suggests on <i>Stockfish</i>. I have saved the PGN files of all the games in the book. I'll be sharing it here soon to make your lives easy. Good luck reading the book like a novel.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Sapolsky,"Sapolsky, Robert M.",,,,5,4.18,,Kindle Edition,559,,1993,19/03/21,07/03/21,,,read,"I learned about Robert M. Sapolsky through his course on Introduction to Human Behavioural Biology. He's a cool biologist from Stanford University. Truth be told, I could never get past the first lecture of the course, but that was because back then my priorities were distorted. I had saved his book <i>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</i> in my to-read list. Most of the primates that I know have this habit of forming infinitely long to-read and to-watch and to-travel bucket lists. And then we ask ourselves in the middle of the night: dear, what is making me stressed? It's your damn to-read list, JOHN SNOW!<br/><br/>At the first glance, the title seemed provocative to me, it was a double-edged question that was hurting on two fronts. Neither did I know Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers? Nor did I know Why Anybody Get Ulcers Anyway? Most of the primates that I know also have this peculiar habit of minding other people's business when they run out of things to mind of their own. Therefore it was extremely necessary to find out the mystery behind the title of this book. The only people I had known who don't get ulcers are the ones who are notorious for giving other people ulcers. And Zebras (not judging a community by its color) do not particularly seem that kind to me.<br/><br/>Okay, now let me break out the answer for you: <i>stress</i>. Stress gives ulcers among the three dozen other things it gives to you, stress is indeed a hopeless giver, such a fine husband material. No wonder many female primates find handling their husbands stressful. The repeated theme of this book is just how many things can go wrong in the body because of stress and how important it is for everyone to recognize this. Now coming to the mystery of Zebras. For animals such as Zebras, stress is episodic (for example: running to save the life from a predator) but for social primates like us, stress is chronic (for example: worrying about the pecking order). <br/><br/>Now that you know the mystery of the title, you must be wondering: should I read this 600 pages long manuscript? And the answer is yes. You must understand the biology of how stress gives you ulcers, gives you heart attacks, destroys your metabolism, hampers your growth, affects your sex life, suppress your immunity, helps you in forgetting your memories, and makes you age faster. You must also understand how stress and depression go hand in hand, how personality types affect individuals, the role of substance abuse, and most importantly how can we actually manage this stress. You might not be able to explain back to your primate friends the biology of stress, you might fumble while pronouncing glucocorticoids, you will definitely forget the other biology jargons, and they might look at you with suspicion: have you really read this book? I know you are feeling stressed just thinking about it, I can hear the ulcers popping. But don't worry, by the time you finish, Robert would have given you few tips on managing that stress. Primates just don't know how to mind their own business. Have a stress-free day!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He is trying to tell you that everything that you have learned about love from movies, novels, music, and poetry is absurd. The idea of romanticism is absurd and rather fatal to our chances of long-term happiness. He says what we typically call love is only the start of love. And that love is a skill, not just enthusiasm. He goes on to the extent of saying, in many ways marriage is a pretty nasty thing to do to someone you claim to love. He takes you through love as a semester-long university course and as a fine professor, he leaves in awe of your newfound vision to see the world. I recommend this book to anyone looking for the answer to the question: what is love?

Two weeks ago, I was looking forward to reading nonfiction ‚Äî any nonfiction, I had been feeling overwhelmed by reading primarily fiction last year. When my friend (Nahid) told me about this book, my first thought was that it would be a book full of exposition about intelligence agencies and geopolitics. I'll have to drag through this book, there will be things I won't understand, and I might not even have the curiosity to understand. I decided to give it a read anyway. I had no expectations that in pages to come, there will be moments when I'll forget to breathe, moments when my heart will be in my mouth, moments when I'll feel like a kid on the first rollercoaster ride of his life. How many times does it happen that the best things arrive when you are not looking for them?<br/><br/>This is the story of Oleg Gordievsky alias <i>SUNBEAM</i> alias <i>GORMSSON</i> alias <i>GORNOV</i> alias <i>NOCTON</i> alias <i>OVATION</i> alias <i>PIMLICO</i> alias <i>TICKLE</i> (because important people have more than one name): colonel of the KGB (Secret Police Force of USSR) who becomes an agent for MI6 (British Secret Intelligence Service). He was disenchanted from KGB, especially after the Soviet Rain on the Prague Spring. While working as an illegal in Denmark for KGB. He had attended classical-music concerts. He had devoured western literature. He had traveled to every corner of that country. And he did it sometimes on spy business, but mostly for the pleasure of being able to do so. He had seen how beautiful life can be when you leave behind the cacophony of lies and the chains of propaganda. It was remarkable to learn that the ideology that originated to librated the unliberated ended up imprisoning an entire country. There are many reasons people attribute to why Oleg became a double agent, but the one that stands out is his cultural superiority.<br/><br/><blockquote>There is a very good reason, he reflected, why ordinary Soviet citizens were not permitted to travel abroad: who but a fully indoctrinated KGB officer would be able to taste such freedom and resist the urge to stay?</blockquote><br/><br/>Oleg after his recruitment to MI6 becomes the station chief of KGB in London and continues to help the MI6 and the west understand how Kremlin works. He is instrumental in saving a nuclear disaster and strengthening British-Soviet ties by identifying Mikhail Gorbachev as the Soviet heir-apparent. He helps the western intelligence agencies filtering the moles in their departments. And in some ways, he plays a subtle role in the dissolution of the USSR.<br/><br/>In 1985, Oleg is called back to Moscow abruptly. Somebody has betrayed him. KGB abducts him, drugs him, interrogate him for treason, but somehow releases him into ghettos. He is told to never work abroad again. KGB is just bidding its time, looking for the solid proof against him, there is no hurry, and Oleg is left to rut like a mouse. How long will he be able to survive like that? Eventually, he'll break down. <br/><br/>Years ago, MI6 had already planned for a situation like that, the plan to exfiltrate Oleg from USSR was called PIMLICO. Everyone knows that one cannot simply leave USSR without the Kremlin's consent, and especially if the one who is planning to leave is someone under suspicion for treachery. The chances of the success of that plan are slim...rather there are hardly any chances at all, and the repercussion of such a mission on diplomacy is immense. Yet, despite everything MI6 with the in-principle approval of then prime minister Margaret Thatcher goes ahead with the PIMLICO. And they do that for a very simple but hard to swallow reason: <b><i>morality.</i></b><br/><br/>In this book, you meet a man, who puts his life in danger for freedom and democracy, betraying his own family, friends, people, and country. His love for the idea he fought to protect takes precedence over his love for the woman he married. Every time Gordievsky is successful in a mission, you smile. Every time Gordievsky is close to getting caught, you pant. You feel his fears and his pains and his excitement. And you live through the story of this incredible man, meanwhile learning a thing or two about these intelligence officers making brush contacts, doing dead drops, or performing dry cleaning. <br/><br/><blockquote>Oleg Gordievsky still lives a double life. To his suburban neighbors, the bowed, bearded old man living quietly behind the tall hedges is just another old-age pensioner, a person of little consequences. In reality he is someone else entirely, a figure of profound historical importance and a remarkable man: proud, shrewd, irascible, his brooding manner illuminated by sudden flashes of ironic humor. He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversations and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.</blockquote><br/><br/>How many times does it happen that the best things arrive when you are not looking for them? I hoped to read nonfiction with the motives of educating myself but ended up with an experience that the best of novels find hard to provide.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

22026,The Sicilian,Mario Puzo,"Puzo, Mario",,0345441702,9780345441706,3,3.99,Ballantine Books,Paperback,416,2001,1984,07/01/21,08/08/19,,,read,"In chess, one of the most combative and powerful opening for black is Sicilian Defence. It's not an opening for the lazy, or defensive, or the weak-hearted. It's for a ruthlessly brave Sicilian. It has elements of romanticism, bloodshed, justice, betrayal, and treachery. Much like the Mario Puzo's novel The Sicilian. <br/><br/><blockquote>""That is Sicily,"" the Don said. ""There is always treachery within treachery within treachery.""</blockquote><br/><br/>This is a gripping story of Turi Giuliano ‚Äî a bandit hero of Sicily, a modern day Robin Hood, who fights against the injustices of the Rome and the Mafia, and is revered by the common citizens of the country. A power tussle exists between Don Croce (nominal head of Mafia, Friends of the Friends) and Turi which constitutes the spine of the story. And although Don is able to outwit Turi in the end to death, continuing to live a lifeless life, Turi becomes a mythical hero...a legend. This book takes you to the Sicily, her cities, her people, and her mountains, and it would be fair to say that Sicily in this novel is not just a setting, but also a character. I'll tell you the honest reason why I wanted to read this book, few years ago, looking at the map of the Italy and Sicily, a friend of mine exclaimed to me: look, it looks like a shoe (Italy) kicking Sicily. That was the inciting incident for me to put The Godfather and The Sicilian in my Kindle.  <br/><br/>Although this book kept me hooked till the last page, filling my imagination with vivid details, the complaint I have with this book is that all the minor character felt quite hollow to me, they felt as if they were just place holders. I'm not sure how long I am going to remember this story. I might change my opinion as the time will pass me by, but for now I'd say that The Sicilian, contrary to my expectations, did not possess the magic The Godfather did.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

George Bailey can't take the problems the life is pestering him with anymore, and he decides to end it all by jumping off the bridge. But it's Christmas! And he's rescued by a guardian angel from heaven. You can save someone's life, but how do you save someone who wishes he had never been born? The angel shows him what his town would have looked like if he hadn't been for all the good deeds over the year. And George Bailey learns that the lives of the people in his town and his family would have been vastly different if it not had been for him. The entire town in the end chips in for the loan that Bailey was finding impossible to pay. Everyone in their own capacities tries their best to help him out, why? Because when they all needed him, he was there to help, he was there because he had this life. Bailey's brother makes a toast, ""George is the richest man in the town."" And indeed he is, for he has friends. The angel leaves Bailey with the message: <i>""no man is a failure who has friends.""</i> <br/><br/>I'll be lying if I say I didn't shed tears at the end of the film. And I guess that's just what life is, with the fibre of your being touching mine, and we all shaping each other's realities. <br/><br/>I had very high expectations from this book for three reasons: a) it was the winner of Goodreads Choice Awards b) it has the premise and the title which as a lover of books you just can't ignore. c) it reminded me of my all time favourite movie (in reverse in some sense). <br/><br/><blockquote>'Between life and death there is a library,' she said. 'And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you had done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?</blockquote><br/><br/>When I read this, I knew I'll be completing this book because c'mon who doesn't have regrets? Liars? Even liars regret not telling the truth somewhere inside their hearts. Nora Seeds just wanted to die, just like George Baily, and I wanted to know what will change her mind? At the Midnight Library, Nora opens different books to live the different regrets she had, but even after her every dream is fulfilled one by one, she realizes that something is missing, she learns that maybe there is no end to the book of regrets. Thoreau said, <i>'It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.'</i> And by sliding through these lives, Nora learns how to see. It is quite a revelation for Nora to discover that the place she wanted to escape to is the exact same place she escaped from. That the prison wasn't the place, but the perspective.<br/><br/>While reading this book sitting on the makeshift chair on the deck of the living quarter of the offshore platform I work at, looking at the beautiful sun setting into the sea, I thought to myself, this place...which sometimes feels like a prison, because of improper connectivity with friends and family, can also be looked at as an exotic vacation destination, and in those moments I felt what the author was trying to say.<br/><br/><blockquote>It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finance more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga.<br/><br/>But it is not the lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. <br/><br/>We can't tell if any of those other versions would have been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.<br/><br/>We don't have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibilities.</blockquote> <br/><br/>The thing is that at some point of time you are going to regret the things you have done or maybe not done, but that regret is the enemy, not the things you have done or maybe not done, and that's what I guess Matt Haig wants us to remember.<br/><br/>Thank you Nahid Shaikh for making me read this book. I hope you finish it soon, and I am super glad to tell you that it wasn't as good as Anxious People. But still it was a fine book. Probably the only complain (and it's a big one) I had from this book was that after a point, the book was highly predictable, you can just feel where the story is going. Also Matt's writing style can sometimes be cute and can sometimes be annoying. In a parallel universe this novel could have just been a novella, and I would have given it 5 stars.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Most books I used to read before used to tell me how to make your prose more beautiful, but this book told me how to tell amazing stories. And I realized the reasons why I was particularly never good at that craft. Have you ever read a book where the author says, hey, I know that's how you do it, and you are like, yes, that's how it's done, and then the author says, look, I'm not gonna lie to you, but the way you do it SUCKS.

With every year passing by the friends and family you can count on gets fewer in count. And in the end you are left all alone, just like you where born. Just like Hubert Bird. And when the last ray of hope is taken away from you, when the last sunshine dies, there is no heart left inside an old man to break. So he packs himself in the four walls of the place he once called home, and pretends to live on. I couldn't hold myself from crying as I reached the end of this book. And as I sit to write this review in the midnight I feel a little unsettled. I just cannot stop thinking about what I have just read. I'm not going to tell you much about the story, but I'm going to tell you that it is going to stay with me for a long long time. And whenever a writer is able to do that...leaving the story in hearts of his/her readers for a long long time, you know, that he/she is one brilliantly fine writer. Thank you Mike Gayle for this book, all the books you have written. I haven't read them, but I am going to. Thank you for breaking my heart and making me cry by telling me the story of this eighty-four year old gentleman, Hubert Bird. Thank you for making both of us realize that we are not alone in being alone.  <br/><br/><blockquote>'You see, the key to helping other people out of them loneliness is nothing more difficult than good old-fashioned perseverance. It's not always easy, me know that, but you've got to be willing to keep doors open, to carry on trying even if it doesn't look like it's working. You've got to refuse to give up on people, even if them given up on themselves.' Hubert paused again, reflecting on just how lonely he'd been all those years, how cut off from the rest of the world.</blockquote><br/><br/>Before I started reading this book, I was so sure that the best book that I've read this year was 'Anxious People' by Fredrik Backman.

Which is to say that the physical health and the mental health go hand in hand, they complement and supplement each other. <br/><br/>The book is divided in two sections. The first section discusses how to manage your physical health with nutrition, supplements, sleep, hydration, and training. I found this part to be extremely helpful. I believe if you are someone like me who has never give dingo's kidney worth of attention to learning about how human bodies work then this book would be a great help. Reading this, I realized the urgent need in my life to add supplements, looking at my diet. I understood the why behind how training works. But most importantly, reading this motivated me to finally hit the gym. I have never felt this way before, the way I feel these days with running, lifting weights, and playing table tennis, also while being a little mindful about what I put in my mouth. The endorphins that release when you do physical work can really make you feel happy. No wonder why so many people in the world use gym to burst stress. <br/><br/>The second section deals with how to create habits, how to manage stress, anxiety, and worry. The author offers some of the life lessons that he has learned through reading books, attending courses, and listening to podcasts. Now again, if you are someone like me who has read countless books on this subject then you'd find this part of the book to be just okay. But to some people, it could be of great help.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend to all the novices who are looking forward to develop a fitness mindset.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And often I would ask, but why should I cling to it? Why should I finish reading it? I knew the answer, it was partly because of the pleasure of finishing things, and partly because of the hope that by the end of the book maybe everything in his life would be okay. But it's not a fairy tale, life is not a fairy tale. 'Monsters are real,' Stephen King said. 'And ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.' If I have to see the silver lining in what Stephen King said, then it would be that sometimes, they lose as well, and that's how life goes on for someone who is chronically depressed. And that was this book was about, that bouts of dark days would come and go, there will be storm inside your head on some days when the only thing that you can think about it that storm, but some days it will be sunshine. And it will be a beautiful sunshine. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>' . . . once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.'<br/>          ‚ÄîHaruki Murakami, <i>Kafka on the Shore</i><br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>Neil Gaiman once said that writing is like walking naked on the street, and if you read this book, you'd see Matt naked, broken, vulnerable, and at his lows when he just wanted to end his life. But that's the thing about human will to survive, in this book, you also see him healing, holding, and learning to live with his illness anyway. <br/><br/>The chapters of this book are like journals of a boy on a journey to self-healing. They are messages that he is writing to himself but they speak to a volume of people around the globe. Matt spoke to my heart when he spoke about finding comfort in life, finding reason to stay alive in the books waiting to be read, and words waiting to be written. <br/><br/><blockquote>There is this idea that you either read to escape or you read to find yourself. I don't really see the difference. We find ourselves through the process of escaping. It is not where we are, but where we want to go, and all that. 'Is there no way out of the mind?' Sylvia Path famously asked. I had been interested in this question (what it meant, what the answers might be) ever since I had come across it as a teenager in a book of quotations. If there is a way out, a way that isn't death itself, then the exit route is through words. But rather that leave the mind entirely, words help us leave a mind, and give us the building blocks to build another one, similar but better, nearby to the old one but with firmer foundations, and very often a better view.<br/><br/>Every book written is the product of a human mind in a particular state. Add all the books together and you get the end sum of humanity. Evert time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself. But each map was incomplete, and I would only locate the treasure if I read all the books, and so the process of finding my best self was an endless quest. And book themselves seemed to me reflect this idea. Which is why the plot of every book ever can be boiled down to 'someone is looking for something'.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And like any other good book, this book leaves me with 10 or so more good books to look forward to read, and hence for those reasons I love this book even more.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Wodehouse. I knew from a long time that this gentleman wrote something that was funny, but I only decided to finally give it a read after an India comic, Rohan Joshi, in a video on his YouTube Channel said, read P.G. Wodehouse if you want to read some of the best slapstick comedy there is. <br/><br/>What ho! This book was humorous, and full of misunderstandings. It was like reading the script of a comedy show. Bertie Wooster who is an aristocrat from London with money enough to never have the need to think about it twice, lives in New York with his personal gentleman Jeeves, who seem to have solution to every trouble Bertie gets into, however, the solutions Jeeves come up with often end up only creating more problems for Bertie. The stories follow a certain formula which is quite predictable, however Wodehouse prose are so effortlessly poetic that you just want to keep reading it, and you don't want to just read it, you want to read it out loud, with the aristocratic accent. <br/><br/>But not all stories in this book are about Bertie and Jeeves, some of them are about Reggie Peppers, however Reggie seems to lack the charm that Bertie possess, and when the book is called My Man Jeeves, you don't really want to read a story that doesn't have Jeeves in it.<br/><br/>There is one thing about comedy genre, come what may, your characters never get hurt. Well, I had this complaint with Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy, and I have that same complaint with this book. And that is, you don't really get to connect with the characters because nothing that is happening to them is felt emotionally. But then again, these books are written with the intent to make you laugh and to brighten up your dark days. DON'T TAKE THINGS SO SERIOUSLY. These books are like a good comic or a good meme. THERE IS NO WHY. <br/><br/>And my second complaint with this book is the complaint I often have with classics, you find it hard to relate. With that said, it was a GOODREAD.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

HUMOROUS. TERRIBLE FUN. AND CUTE.<br/><br/>She writes that there is a strange but potent comfort in the discovery that someone else in the universe has experienced the exact same feelings as we have. And that's what this book is about, knowing that, more or less, all of us are going through same things, just that some of us are good at managing it, or maybe hiding it than others. But then again, maybe not, maybe some of us are just introverted kids, who live in our own minds than in real world. But then, does that mean our minds are beautiful?<br/><br/><b>On Feeling Lost</b><br/><br/><blockquote>And in trying to figure out we want to do, in trying to figure out what makes us happy, we're bound to feel a little lost at times. But maybe this sense of feeling lost is necessary. Maybe feeling lost is what pushes us to keep exploring. It's the ethereal song that awakens our curiosities and drives us to follow cows, discover hidden cows, and find remnants of good in a world that so often feels too dark and broken.<br/><br/>Maybe feeling lost is just the prerequisite of adventure‚Äîthe first chapter of any good story</blockquote><br/><br/><b>On JUNK</b><br/><br/><blockquote>There is something to be said about the people who are able to give us the exact kind of junk we love. Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.</blockquote><br/><br/><b>On Moving On <i>hehehe</i></b><br/><br/><blockquote>My understanding of ""moving on"" has shifted substantially over the years. I no longer consider moving on to be synonymous with no caring. I think it's more complex than that. I think moving on is about allowing ourselves to remember the good and the bad, to distinguish the past from the present, and to accept who we are, who we were, and everyone we met along the way.</blockquote><br/><br/><b>On BEST FRIENDS</b><br/><br/><blockquote>With old friends, there's no censorship. You can speak as you please because you've earned the luxary of being yourself. Pointless conversations can go on for hours, but you won't feel the hours. And if you should say something questionable, they'll know it's because you're having a bad week, and not because you're a bad person. True friends see the best parts of us, even when we forgot those parts ourselves.</blockquote><br/><br/>There are so many more parts of this book and comics that I want to share with you but I can't right now. If you want to cheer up your day, then this is the book you pick. You don't believe what I say? Don't worry. It'll All Make Sense Eventually.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I loved the song so much that I streamed it for the entire year. On the cover of the song, it was written: music from the amazon original series modern love. So when the days did start feeling long enough for me, I decided to watch the series. This series was based on the New York Times column by the same name, Modern Love. And guess what? To my surprise, there was a book as well. So I watched the series, I loved it. And then I read the book, I loved it. It's not a book with a collection of love stories where a boy meets a girl. It's a book of love stories when it's really hard to love, and you decide to love nonetheless. If there is one compliment I can give to this book, then it would be that it made me see the love in all its forms and ages. <br/><br/>Another reason why I wanted to read this book was to see how these short stories were translated into episodes of the series. It was nice to see how screenwriters work with these story structures and make them more lovable.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You know, I wanted to love it. And I did when I started reading it. It was hard to read a line and not shed tears of laughter. The opening scene, with Arthur, Posser, and Ford was hysterical. And then listening to Vogon Captain sing his poetry. It was all so funny. And my god, the spot-on observations and one-liners of Douglas. This book had probably most screenshot moments. Where you are like, wait I have got to record this. It is so funny. Although sometimes that makes you think, man, he told me this entire story just to say that line. Isn't it Douglas? Haha. But that wasn't the problem. The problem with the book was that I was not able to emotionally connect with the characters. Maybe the author never intended me to feel for the characters. I was charmed by them, but I wasn't rooting for them. The book lost her luster in the middle and end game. With that said, I enjoyed what this book had to offer.

I'd be lying if I say I wasn't swayed by the phrase SAVE THE CAT. I'm a simple man at the end of the day. On the surface, it's a book on screenwriting, but by the soul, it's a book on story-telling.</p><br/>  <br/><b>Wait, Save the what?</b><br/><br/><p>In every story, in every movie, there is a scene, where we meet the hero, and the hero does something that defines who he is and makes us root for him. This could be literally saving the cat in the middle of a chase sequence or giving away his prized possession so someone who needs it more than he does. We don't love our heroes because they are cool, or because they have fancy gadgets, or because they have a batmobile, we love them because they are kind and because they save the cat, even when it isn't easy.<p><br/><br/><b>Learning Notes</b><br/><br/><b><i>1. Log Line: What is it?</i></b><br/><br/><p>To be able to tell a good one-line or logline ‚Äî a one- or two-sentence grabber that tells us everything. It must have four basic elements:<br/><br/>a. Irony.<br/>b. A compelling mental picture.<br/>c. Audience and cost.<br/>d. A killer title.</p><br/><br/><b><i>2. Give me the same thing...only different!</i></b><br/><br/><blockquote> ""To not know the roots of the story you're trying to create, either from the last IOO years of movie storytelling or the last thousand, is to not honor the traditions and fundamental goals of your job. Give me the same thing... only different"" then is what storytelling has always been about. But it's the way we put new twists on old tales, bring them up to date, and give them a spin that's meaningful for our contemporaries."" </blockquote><br/><br/><p>10 movie/story categories:<br/><br/>Monster in. the House ‚Äî Of which Jaws, Tremors, Alien, The Exorcist, Fatal Attraction, and Panic Room are examples.<br/><br/>Golden Fleece ‚Äî This is the category of movie best exemplified by Star Wars; The Wizard of Oz; Planes, Trains and Automobiles; Back To The Future; and most ""heist movies.""<br/><br/>Out of the Bottle ‚Äî This incorporates films like Liar, Liar; Bruce Almighty; Love Potion; Freaky Friday; Flubber; and even my own little kid hit from Disney, Blank Check.<br/><br/>Dude with a Problem ‚Äî This is a genre that ranges in style, tone, and emotional substance from Breakdown and Die Hard to Titanic and Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Rites Of Passage ‚Äî Every change-of-life story from IO to Ordinary People to Days of Wine and Roses makes this category.<br/><br/>Buddy Love ‚Äî This genre is about more than the buddy movie dynamic as seen in cop buddy pictures, Dumb & Dumber, and Rain Man ‚Äî but also every love story ever made!<br/><br/>Whydunit ‚Äî Who cares who, it's why that counts. Includes Chinatown, China Syndrome, JFK, and The Insider.<br/><br/>The Fool Triumphant ‚Äî One of the oldest story types, this category includes Being There, Forrest Gump, Dave, The Jerk, Amadeus, and the work of silent clowns like Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd.<br/><br/>Institutionalized. ‚ÄîJust like it sounds, this is about groups: Animal House, M*A*S*H, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and ""family"" sagas such as American Beauty and The Godfather.<br/><br/>Superhero ‚Äî This isn't just about the obvious tales you'd think of, like Superman and Batman, but also includes Dracula, Frankenstein, even Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.</p><br/><br/><b><i>3. It's about a guy who...</i></b><br/><br/><p>Tell me a story about a guy who...<br/>>¬†I can identify with.<br/>>¬†I can learn from.<br/>> I have a compelling reason to follow.<br/>>¬†I believe deserves to win and...<br/>>¬†Has stakes that are primal and ring true for me.<br/>>¬†Offer the most conflict in that situation<br/>>¬†Have the longest way to go emotionally and...<br/>>¬†Are the most demographically pleasing!</p><br/><br/><b><i>4.

Numbers inside parenthesis represent page numbers of your screenplay. For example in a 120-page screenplay, your setup would be the first 10 pages. Before you start working on your project, you must fill this beat sheet with a paragraph describing each part of the story.</p><br/><br/><b><i>5. Building the perfect beast</i></b><br/><br/><p>40 scenes. That's all it takes. Get a board: black, white, green, any you like. Divide the board into 4 parts with horizontal lines. You have ACT ONE, ACT TWO (PART 1), ACT TWO (PART 2), and ACT THREE. Now get index cards, and write scene descriptions on those cards, and stick them on the board. Each scene must do either cause an emotional change (+/-) or must create a conflict (><). The board is a way for you to ""see"" your movie even before you start writing. It is a way to easily test different scenes, story arcs, ideas, bits of dialogue and story rhythms, and decide whether they work ‚Äî or if they just plain suck.<p><br/><br/><b><i>6. The Immutable Laws of Screenplay Physics</i></b><br/><br/><p>I'll just mention the names without explaining them, hoping these funny names would catch your fancy and would motivate you to read Save the Cat.

TOO MUCH MARZIPAN.<br/>> WATCH OUT FOR THAT GLACIER.</p><br/><br/><b><i>7. What's wrong with this picture?</i></b><br/><br/><p>Here's a checklist to see if your lead needs more oomph:<br/><br/>1.¬†Does my hero lead the action? Is he proactive at every stage of the game and fired up by a desire or a goal?<br/><br/>2.¬†Do my characters ""talk the plot""? Am I saying things a novelist would say through my characters instead of letting it be seen in the action of my screenplay?<br/><br/>3.¬†Is the bad guy bad enough? Does he offer my hero the right kind of challenge? Do they both belong in this movie?<br/><br/>4.¬†Does my plot move faster and grow more intense after the midpoint? Is more revealed about the hero and the bad guy as we come in to the Act Three finale?<br/><br/>5.¬†Is my script one-note emotionally? Is it all drama? All comedy? All sadness? All frustration? Does it feel like it needs, but does not offer, emotion breaks?<br/><br/>6. Is my dialogue flat? After doing the Bad Dialogue Test does it seem like everyone talks the same? Can I tell one character from another just by how he or she speaks?<br/><br/>7. Do my minor characters stand out from each other, and are they easy to differentiate by how they look in the mind's eye? Is each unique in speech, look, and manner?<br/><br/>8.¬†Does the hero's journey start as far back as it can go? Am I seeing the entire length of the emotional growth of the hero in this story?<br/><br/>9.¬†Is it primal? Are my characters, at their core, reaching out for a primal desire ‚Äî to be loved, to survive, to protect family, to exact revenge?<br/><br/><b>Further Reads</b><br/><br/>Screenplay, Syd Field<br/><br/>How to Write a Movie in 21 Days, Viki King<br/><br/>Hero With A Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell<br/><br/>Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting, Robert McKee<br/><br/><b>Final Words</b><br/><br/>If you have read this far, thank you so much for bearing with me, I know a lot of what I've blatantly stolen from the book may not be making much sense to you right now, but I did not write this with the intent of summarizing this book for you, rather just to give you enough push to get started.

Sanderson teaches his students how to do plotting by outline projects by providing the outline of his own book, Skyward. That's why I decided to read this book so that I can read the outline so that I can understand how to structure writing projects. I've never read science fiction before, but after reading this book I'm going to read science fiction more now. I loved getting immersed and lost in the world that Sanderson created. <br/><br/><b>What is this story about?</b><br/><br/>You have a dream. But the road looks hopeless, iron claws are clutching you, they are holding you down, and you want to fly. You dream to fly one day. You want to prove them all wrong, you are not a coward, your father was not a coward, or was he? You learn that everything that they told you was a lie. Self-doubt creeps in, you are not so sure about yourself anymore. You are flying but it feels like you are falling. But your friends save you, somehow in good stories they always do.

They say there's something likable in everyone. It's impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them. That's the essence of this beautifully written book. What is this book about, Girish? A friend had asked me when I shared a quote from this book on my Instagram story. I said I'm still figuring it out, I've figured it out tonight. You might think that this book is about a therapist (by the way therapist and the rapist are spelled the same) seeing a therapist after experiencing a devastating breakup, hoping to bring together her broken pieces, while helping her patients bring together their broken pieces. In essence, you'd be right. But this book is more than a memoir of a therapist. This book is like going to an ophthalmologist and trying different lenses to figure out how to see life in a more palatable way. It's filled with insights, that make you gasp, and contemplate, and rethink your own actions. It's filled with stories, that make you want to not only read them again but to read them to as many people as you can. So you take out your smartphone and record the entire chapter in your voice and send it to your best friends to listen. It's the kind of book when you finish it, you tell yourself, I'll have to read it again. There is just so much I want to experience again, listen again, tell myself again. It rarely happens, this urge of rereading a book. That's what this book is about, knowing that we are here for each other to get through this, whatever it is - life.<br/><br/>Although this book was nonfiction, it felt so real. Surprised I'm calling nonfiction real? We all can believe whatever helps us sleep better. This is one of the best books I read this year, maybe in all the years. I think more words will only diminish what I'm feeling. I just wish I'd read this book a little before. I can't wait to talk to someone about this book.         ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There are a few ideas that I absolutely loved while reading this book:<br/><br/>A. That fairy tales are true not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be defeated. <br/><br/>B. Father went to the hilltop with his kids, they accidentally pry on the nest of yellow wasps. Father asks the kids to run away but he stands there, getting stung by the wasps. If he would have run, the wasps might have reached his kids. When they reach back home, he realizes that his glasses fell off near the nest, and also that he has been stung 39 times. He recalls that he wasn't scared when he was getting stung by the wasps, that wasn't being brave because that was all he could do. He is scared now with the thought of going back to the nest to get his glasses. That requires bravery. It's not bravery to find yourself standing in front of a fire-spitting dragon. But it's brave when you decide to face him again for a just cause.  <br/><br/>It was an interesting story which the author wrote it for her daughter. I enjoyed reading it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

When he wakes up in the morning, he finds himself alone, she's gone. I think this book's similar to that song. <br/><br/>""no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning."" <br/><br/>This book leaves me feeling hauntingly sad.

Think about biscuits, will you? <br/><br/>I'd leave you with one last thing before I go.<br/><br/><i>We‚Äôre looking for something to cling on to, something to fight for, something to look forward to. </i><br/><br/>Okay, I'm sorry, that was a lie (because sometimes we lie to those we love, to save them), there is one more thing I want you to listen actually.<br/><br/><i>We give those we love nicknames, because love requires a word that belongs to us alone.</i><br/><br/>Somewhere in the parallel universe, that picture had a monkey, and a frog, and a giraffe.<br/><br/>Have a good day, if you found yourself anxious enough to read this book, then I want you to know, <i>'it wasn't your fault'</i>. But if you don't, I'll still plant my apple tree and hope. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I had spent an year or so learning the digital technologies like Data Analytics and IoT myself, and I just wanted everyone in my college to learn about them too. Back then I was highly fascinated with this trend, but I always lacked words to spread my enthusiasm about it. In fact, I was asked to explain what I meant by this during my job interviews, but I fumbled and failed. It was always so hard to explain how digital technologies are engaging in Oil & Gas Industry to the recent graduates, let alone veterans of the industry. This book gave me words to express myself. It's filled with case studies and insights, for me it was a page turner. However I felt that if you are not familiar with digital technologies and terms then you might struggle a bit. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The first book was Boy: Tales of Childhood. The second book was this: Going Solo. And the gentleman, Dahl, has lived one hell of a life. <br/><br/>This book starts with Roald starting of a new journey after graduating from school. He is going to East Africa, to Dar es Salaam. He'll be an oil man, working for Shell Oil Company (more reasons why I relate to him). There he shares his adventures with Mambas (deadliest snakes in Africa) and Simba (lion in Swahili). And how peculiar it is for an Englishman to live in a place like that. The war soon breaks out and he has to join the RAF to fight against Bwana Hitler of Germani. He learns how to fly a fighter plane. He crashes his plane, and almost dies. Imagine we could have lost the soul who gave us <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>. He shoots down enemy planes. While most of the pilots who joined the RAF with him were killed in action, even his good friend David Coke, he survived. And then he goes back to home, and falls in the arms of his mother, to whom he wrote letters as frequently as possible. She had lost all hopes that she'd ever be able to see her Roald again. <br/><br/>Here is an anecdote from the book from the time he crashed his plane, and barely survived. It shivers my spine when I think about it. The difference in life and death is always few lucky inches.     <br/><br/><blockquote>It seemed to me that I had been permanently blinded, and as I lay there in my quiet black room where all sounds, however tiny, had suddenly become twice as loud, I had plenty of time to think about what total blindness would mean in the future. Curiously enough, it did not frighten me. It did not even depress me. In a world where war was all around me and where I had ridden in dangerous little aeroplanes that roared and zoomed and crashed and caught fire, blindness, not to mention life itself, was no longer too important. I was already beginning to realize that the only way to conduct oneself in a situation where bombs rained down and bullets whizzed past, was to accept the dangers and all the consequences as calmly as possible. Fretting and sweating about it all was not going to help.</blockquote><br/><br/>Now despite facing death so closely, it's remarkable what Roald has to say about his time. <i>‚ÄúWhat a fortunate fellow I am, I kept telling myself. Nobody has ever had such a lovely time as this!‚Äù</i>.<br/><br/>I wonder sometimes, does all the art in the world is a mask for the pain that a human has endured, and survived. Is art is to pain what lamp is to darkness? I do not surely know, what I do know is that <i>‚Äúa life is made up of a great number of small incidents and a small number of great ones.‚Äù</i> and Roald has lived one hell of a life.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I don't know if I should smile, hope, or cry? The first chapter of this book made me laugh my ass-off. The last chapter of this book made me cry my heart-out. <br/><br/>The chapters in between taught me about the value of shit, about what it was to live in apartheid South Africa - institutionalized racism, about the tough love of a mother for her child, about why I should never buy a second-hand car, about how crime can sometimes be way a of life, about the role of language in touching hearts, about domestic violence, about so many other things I am fumbling right now to put together. <br/><br/>For reasons unknown to me, I found myself reading biographies and memories this year, and without a doubt <b>Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood</b> was the best read so far.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I know the book and the movie are quite different. And I assume that's the reason why some people didn't like the book at all. Maybe I might change my opinion once I do watch the movie. But today I'm only wondering how sometimes bein a idiot can take you to places where no sane person can ever go. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>LET ME SAY THIS: bein a idiot is no box of chocolates.

Gump can give you a FOMO about living an ordinary life. Did I tell you that he even fought the presidential elections? And yet, he's only an idiot. Is he? You decide.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But let me tell you this: sometimes at night, when I look up at the stars, an see the whole sky jus laid out there, don't you think I ain't rememberin it all.

I may be a idiot, but most of the time, anyway, I tried to do the right thing-- an dreams is jus dreams, ain't they?

Each of them, even after a lapse of fifty and sometimes sixty years, has remained seared on my memory. </i><br/><br/>Little Dahl is accused of cheating and lying to his master Hardcastle. Master Hardcastle is not ready to listen to what Little Dahl has to say. He gives him a stripe. Now a stripe means five cane sticks on your bum from the Headmaster. The next day Little Dahl is invited to the Headmaster's chamber and is asked to lower his pyjamas and bend down. Litle Dahl keep explaining that he is innocent, but he just can't win in words with his Headmaster. Headmaster takes out his cane, and hits Little Dahl as hard as he possible can. Little Dahl writes that it felt like a rifle shot. He screams. The door of the chamber is open, possibly Master Hardcastle standing outside smiling, all his mates can hear to the screams of Little Dahl. They feel angust for the unjustice that has been done. When the Little Dahl returns to his dorm, all boys come to surrround him with sympathetic faces. But one of the boy is so violently incensed by the whole affair that he comes to him and says, 'I know why they did that to you, because you don't have a father. But I do, and I am going to write him what has happened. He'll see do something about it.'<br/><br/>Little Dahl knew that nothing will come out of this brave act, and nothing did. But Little Dahl nevertheless felt that it was a touching and generous gesture from one small boy to another.  <br/><br/>Now I have never read Roald Dahl before, I saw the spines of his books in the shelfs of my school library but for some reasons back then my heart always lingered around tech magazines and books with lots and lots of pictures. Dahl has an amazing talent of vividly taking the reader to the places that he has been to. If I ever decide to write an Autobiography of my own, this is exactly how I will try to write it.

He's under house arrest in a grand hotel of Moscow, Metropol. Count restarts his life because if a Gentleman doesnot master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them. The peope he meets during his stay at Metropol helps him usher his restlessness towards purposefulness. He makes friends with the staff of hotel, builds a routine, and explore the extents of Metropol. He is sometimes visited by old friends and sometimes he finds new friends in a small world. While we learn from Count what it means to be a Gentleman, for a man who has no where to go oftern goes on the thought train of philosophical musings and self reflection. Count teaches us that every life deserves not only our consideration, but our reconsideration‚Äîand our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour. He teaches us that what matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause; what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim. <br/><br/>Count's outlook change towards the life after he meets Sofia. The daughter of an old friend who leaves Sofia in Count's custody only to never return. Sofia grows old to be a young charming lady. Sofia becomes the Count's biggest purpose. For not only he's proud of her, but at moments could help but astonish over her talents and intellect. Sofia is going to play Piano in Paris, representing Russian. And Count plans an escape from Metropol. <br/><br/>There are so many elements in this book that I find hard to put down in a short review. This book lets you peep inside Russia in the times of its its greatest turmoils. This book lets you sway in Amor Towles amazing description of scenes and playful writing style. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know what it is to be a Gentleman?<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

They help us solve dilemma and choose between diverging roads. Babylonians believed in stars. All the important life decisions were based on the orientation of stars. Babylonians loved stargazing. <br/><br/>But, then one day one rebellious kid in one village refused to believe in stars, he said, ""Stars lie. God created them, and he created all of us and he wrote all about it in this holy book"". <br/><br/>And that's how god and scripture based religions were invented. Just like that, humans gave the control of their lives from stars to god. People stopped looking at stars and they started reading holy books instead and started praying to god. Through god they derived the meaning of their life. If the man was suffering, he said to himself, I shall suffer if that's what god has written for me. If the man had to fight in wars, he said to himself, I shall fight if that's what god has written for me. If the man had to starve in famines, he said to himself I shall starve if that's what god has written for me. Because god knows best, after all he created me, and he is somewhere out there looking after me. <br/><br/>But, then one day one rebellious kid in one town refused to believe in god, he said, ""God is a fiction created by us humans, we wrote those holy books and we interpreted them to suit ourselves - we are the master of our own souls"". <br/><br/>And that's how liberalism and free will was invented. Whenever in dilemma follow your inner voice. Everyone agreed that the customer is always right, voters knows the best, and the beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Now humans need not look to stars or read holy books or pray to god when they had to decide whom to marry, what career path to choose, or where to invest their money. They could just listen to their inner voice - their true self. But it wasn't always easy to listen to what self had to say, and how independent the free will was always remained a question for the skeptic. Humans kept preaching about ways you could learn to listen to your inner voice, ways in which you could get to know yourself - such as watching sunset on a beach, climb mountains, reading a book by Fredrick Backmann or Kurt Vonnegut, having an heartfelt conversation with friends, or watching a inspiring movie about following your passion. <br/><br/>But, then one day one rebellious kid in one a city refused to believe in free will and inner voices, he said, ""Inner voice is a lie. I have a community of voices inside me, I don't even know who I am? I would rather rely on Spotify to recommend me good music then listen to my inner voice. I would rather rely on Netflix to recommend me a good show then listen to my inner voice. I would rather rely on a software like Tinder to find who will I marry to. I would rather rely on Google trends to decide my career.""<br/><br/>And that's how data religion is invented, with it's own dogmas and commandments. According to this religion, Sapiens are out dated organic algorithms, and they can be replaced by inorganic intelligence, which may not be conscious at all. Algorithms that know us better then we know ourselves. Algorithms whom we cannot comprehend. Imagine living in world where what you have to do with your time is not the outcome of moment of stars, or will of god, or your inner voice. Rather it is a calculated response to all the data that you had been supplying to the algorithm. And the response actually works for you, it's no more a placebo or a pseudo faith. Do these algorithms need to be conscious? Not necessary. They just have to give better results.<br/><br/>But, then one day one kid will rebel..............<br/><br/>This book - Homo Deus: A Brief History of Mankind ends with three concluding statements, which I'd like to quote here:<br/><br/>1. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.<br/>2. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.<br/>3. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.   <br/><br/>*life in progress*",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The Connie's Wedding, Sonny's Murder, Don's Statesmanship, and Michael's Ruthlessness was always vivid in my memory (okay, slightly faded). The book kept lurking in my kindle for an year before I made my mind about reading it, just few days back. I played mandolin music on spotify and started reading. <br/><br/>I felt transformed into the world of Mafia. I felt like a silent and watchful part of Corleone family. Mario's way of storytelling was worth noting, the story is non-linear. I particularly liked the fact that Don's present life was narrated before the reader learns about the story that made young Vito Corleone the Don. The novel is really gripping and despite the fact that I had seen the movie before I enjoyed the book in countless little ways which I can't put in words. The family saga was a rollercoaster ride. Easily one the finest novel I read till date. <br/><br/>Well, there are a lot of Sicilian mannerisms to be learned from the book but I'll stick to my omerta and let you see it for yourself by reading the book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In the age of information, the ability to extract solution of the problems and the ability to document the solution is something every engineer must be proficient at. I felt shortchanged for not reading this book earlier. Despite being academically good I always struggled with research projects. Partly because I never worked with a guide. Partly because I never read this book. Now that I have, I feel that the next project I pick, I'm going to do justice to that project. <br/><br/>In sophomore year, our class was assigned to write a report on a sedimentary basin. I spent countless hours randomly scavenging material online and then ruthlessly plagiarizing everything. For a) I could never understand the logic behind doing that project b) I never knew how to do it otherwise. Now after reading this book I would have done things differently. I'm inspired to do them again, just that my time is limited.<br/><br/>I recommend this book to every student, irrespective of their experience or interest in research.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Fractured and faulted whose pores are saturated with multiple phases. All the odds have always stacked against her. Even her cohesion has long remained a question yet she never has perished. She is a complex process, not a supercomputer can simulate. A book that is unputdownable. A story that has been told, retold and untold by different narrators time after time. She is unprecedented in her approach and way of life. She isn't about sharing the common history and the common geography. She is a concoction. She is a conundrum.  She is a concept. She is India. Not a country she is for the forces that make a country has remained far away from her. Her nature is not permeable to conventional ideas, man she is difficult to handle and difficult to understand. <br/><br/>Therefore in schools I believe, they should teach a subject called India. India is not a country but a concept. Concept weaved by the great men and women who took birth on her soil, who toiled her soil, and for whom she bored all her fruits. The thing about concepts is that they need to be beautifully explained, otherwise they lead to confusions. And history has taught us well what a bunch of confused people can do. Without a doubt, the standard textbook for this subject should be The Discovery of India by Jawaharlal Nehru. His articulation of the concept India is should be read by every Indian. Not only has he articulated it well but also he has envisioned it. <br/><br/>A subtle twist in the history, a butterfly flapping her wings somewhere, would have changed the entire course. An evil thought in the minds of her leaders would have resulted in catastrophe. The gift we have today of distinct unity and diversity would have been snatched away and India would have turned into a country and her concept would have been forgotten.<br/><br/>Indian freedom struggle was a gift for the future. It wasn't only about getting rid of the imperial rule, rather it was a quest for the meaning India would possess. It was about understanding this woman and learning to love her despite all her faults and fractures. Despite the fact that she wasn't exclusive to one phase. Despite the fact that she wasn't perfect but full of heterogeneity and disharmonies. The freedom struggle was about finding the melodies in her sounds and making peace with her smell.<br/><br/>Happy Independence Day.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
