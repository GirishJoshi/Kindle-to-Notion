When everyone looks at you as the coward’s daughter—not a coward’s daughter, but the singular Coward’s Daughter—you develop an attitude.”.

“Pride is a virtue in those who make it one.”.

It didn’t just talk—it seemed to have trouble stopping.

“I am a machine, and my conclusions are therefore logical—while yours are biased by organic irrationality.” He made a few lights on his dash blink. “That is a clever way of saying you are the stupid one, in case you—”.

“I am a machine, and my conclusions are therefore logical—while yours are biased by organic irrationality.” He made a few lights on his dash blink. “That is a clever way of saying you are the stupid one, in case you—” “I understood,” I said. “Thanks.” “You’re welcome!”.

“Everyone treats me really strangely once they see the pin. Like, they listen to what I say, and tell me my ideas are good—even if they aren’t. And people make way for me, like I’m someone important.”.

Two other pilots had died as well, and composing letters to their families would take a bite out of her evening, but she’d do it. To those families, the loss would take a bite out of their lives.

“I refuse to be trapped by bonds of autocracy and nationalism,”.

“As the Saint always said, true failure is choosing to fail.”.

Good people were brave. Bad people were cowards. I knew my father had been a good person, so it was obvious to me that he couldn’t have run away. End of story. Close the book.

“I hope you enjoy being a hero when your corpse is rotting like your friend’s, alone in a wasteland, forgotten and ignored.”.

“I need something to do,” I said. “Something other than just sitting.

“I need something to do,” I said. “Something other than just sitting there, dwelling on what I’ve lost.”.

“If you don’t say what you’re thinking,” Kimmalyn said solemnly, “then it will stay in your head.”.

“Some humans like to be given time to grieve on their own. I will stop speaking to you for two days, to see if isolation provides the needed support. Please enjoy moving through the stages of grief.”.

But one thing I can’t believe is that someone is destined to be a coward or a traitor. No, I can’t accept that. I could never accept that.”.

“It has always seemed to me,” she said, “that a coward is a person who cares more about what people say than about what is right. Bravery isn’t about what people call you, Spensa. It’s about who you know yourself to be.”.

Victorious warriors win first and then go to war.

Brave until the end. No backing down, Spin.

“Hello!” M-Bot said to me from the cockpit. “You have nearly died, and so I will say something to distract you from the serious, mind-numbing implications of your own mortality! I hate your shoes.”.

“I didn’t want to be predictable,” M-Bot added. “So I said that I hate them. But actually, I think those shoes are quite nice. Please do not think I have lied.”.

The answer is not to fear the spark, but to learn to control it.


# Save the Cat! (Blake Snyder)

(On second thought, are you SURE you want this published, Blake? It might beef up the competition!).

There are lots of good screenwriting how-to's out there. And if you want to see where it all began, look to the master, Syd Field, who started it all and taught everybody.

I like Viki King's book with the improbable title of How to Write a Movie in 21 Days. Improbable, yes, but I've done it — and sold the script I wrote, too.

I also value Joseph Campbell's work. Hero With A Thousand Faces remains the best book about storytelling ever.

Because liking the person we go on a journey with is the single most important element in drawing us into the story.

The problem for us, the spec screenwriters of the world, is that we don't own any of these pre-sold franchises nor are we likely to. We're the guys and gals with a laptop computer and a dream.

(Please note: Anything "from hell" is always a comedy plus.).

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is: irony.

One of my personal favorites is producer David Permut's pitch for Blind Date: "She's the perfect woman — until she has a drink." I don't know about you, but I see it. I see a beautiful girl and a date gone bad and a guy who wants to save it because... she's the one! There's a lot going on in that one-line, far more than in the actual movie, but that's a different subject altogether. The point is that a good logline, in addition to pulling you in, has to offer the promise of more.

If you don't have the logline, maybe you should rethink your whole movie.

No matter who is encouraging you on the friend side of your life, it's the strangers you really need to impress.

Movies are intricately made emotion machines.

A hero goes "on the road" in search of one thing and winds up discovering something else — himself.

Psyche. "I wish I had a_" is probably the single most frequently spoken prayer since Adam.

"An ordinary guy finds himself in extraordinary circumstances.".

When A Man Loves A Woman.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

Each has a breakout character whose role is to expose the group goal as a fraud.

When we put on a uniform, be it the uniform of the Army or a comfortable cotton shirt with a little polo player over the pocket, we give up who we are to a certain extent.

Indeed our identification with him must come from sympathy for the plight of being misunderstood.

True originality can't begin until you know what you're breaking away from.

Survival, hunger, sex, protection of loved ones, and fear of death grab us.

A guy gets a talking car. Knowing what you know about how to amp up the hero, the bad guy, and the primal goal, write a logline for that idea. And make sure you use adjectives that grab us.

"You have to be this tall to go on this ride.".

Had delivered on the promise of the premise.

One night I taped the old comedy classic What's Up, Doc?, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. And I discovered, the next day as I topped the mountain crest, that the movie was perfectly, evenly divided into two halves and that its midpoint was a "down.".

Experienced as I topped the mountain pass and the first half of What's Up, Doc? that I had taped came to an end. The movie had two even halves! The power and the purpose of a strong midpoint was forever clear to me. After that I began to see how many movies had midpoints that changed the whole dynamic of the film. But the midpoint does more than present an "up" or "down." You will hear the phrase "the stakes are raised at the midpoint" in a lot of script meetings. Because they are. It's the point where the fun and games are over. It's back to the story! It's also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-the-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

It's also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-the-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

The rule is: It's never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All Is Lost point.

Screenplays are structure. Precisely made Swiss clocks of emotion.

Here's a great rule of thumb: A hero never asks questions! The hero knows and others around him look to him for answers, not the other way around. If you see a lot of question marks in your hero's dialogue, there's a problem. The hero knows; he never asks.

Good dialogue tells us more about what's going on in its subtext than on its surface.

It's been done, babe, it's been done.


# Wonder (R. J. Palacio)

But I know ordinary kids don’t make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds.


# Sanderson's First Law | Brandon Sanderson (brandonsanderson.com)

An author’s ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.

Magic creates problems, then people solve those problems on their own without much magic.

We have books where the magic is included in order to establish a sense of wonder and give the setting a fantastical feel. Books that focus on this use of magic tend to want to indicate that men are a small, small part of the eternal and mystical workings of the universe. This gives the reader a sense of tension as they’re never certain what dangers—or wonders—the characters will encounter.

There is a reason that Gandalf doesn’t just fly Frodo to Mount Doom with magic, then let him drop the ring in. Narratively, that just doesn’t work with the magic system. We don’t know what it can do, and so if the writer uses it to solve a lot of problems, then the tension in the novel ends up feeling weak. The magic undermines the plot instead enhancing it.


# Maybe You Should Talk to Someone (Lori Gottlieb)

It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them.

It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them. We should take the world’s enemies, get them in a room to share their histories and formative experiences, their fears and their struggles, and global adversaries would suddenly get along. I’ve found something likable in literally everyone I’ve seen as a therapist, including the guy who attempted murder. (Beneath his rage, he turned out to be a real sweetheart.).


# Story (Robert McKee)

Later, before entering the university, I deduced that the best possible life includes as many rounds of golf as possible, and therefore, I would become a dentist. “Dentist?!” my mother laughed. “You can’t be serious. What happens when they cure all teeth problems? Where will dentists be then? No, Bobby, people will always need entertainment. I’m looking out for your future. You’re going into show business.”.

Anxious, inexperienced writers obey rules. Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules. Artists master the form.

No one needs yet another recipe book on how to reheat Hollywood leftovers.

Mother and daughter clash over the demands of dependence versus independence, permanence versus change, self versus others—conflicts every family knows.

Stereotypical stories stay at home, archetypal stories travel.

The cinema’s master storytellers give us the double-edged encounter we crave.

First, the discovery of a world we do not know. No matter how intimate or epic, contemporary or historical, concrete or fantasized, the world of an eminent artist always strikes us as somewhat exotic or strange.

We go to the movies to enter a new, fascinating world, to inhabit vicariously another human being who at first seems so unlike us and yet at heart is like us, to live in a fictional reality that illuminates our daily reality.

Pascal once wrote a long, drawn-out letter to a friend, then apologized in the postscript that he didn’t have time to write a short one.

A story is not only what you have to say but how you say it. If content is cliché, the telling will be cliché. But if your vision is deep and original, your story design will be unique.

A mature artist never calls attention to himself, and a wise artist never does anything merely because it breaks convention.

Stories are equipment for living.

How should a human being lead his life?.

The world now consumes films, novels, theatre, and television in such quantities and with such ravenous hunger that the story arts have become humanity’s prime source of inspiration, as it seeks to order chaos and gain insight into life. Our appetite for story is a reflection of the profound human need to grasp the patterns of living, not merely as an intellectual exercise, but within a very personal, emotional experience. In the words of playwright Jean Anouilh, “Fiction gives life its form.”.

The hard-to-believe truth is that what we see on the screen each year is a reasonable reflection of the best writing of the last few years.

With rare exceptions, unrecognized genius is a myth.

For writers who can tell a quality story, it’s a seller’s market—always has been, always will be.

Today’s would-be writers rush to the typewriter without first learning their craft.

Experience, however, is overrated. Of course we want writers who don’t hide from life, who live deeply, observe closely. This is vital but never enough. For most writers, the knowledge they gain from reading and study equals or outweighs experience, especially if that experience goes unexamined. Self-knowledge is the key—life plus deep reflection on our reactions to life.

To that end scholars such as William Archer, Kenneth Rowe, and John Howard Lawson wrote excellent books on dramaturgy and the prose arts. Their method was intrinsic, drawing strength from the big-muscle movements of desire, forces of antagonism, turning points, spine, progression, crisis, climax—story seen from the inside out.

As a result, with some notable exceptions, the current generation of writers has been undereducated in the prime principles of story.

European academics generally deny that writing can, in any sense, be taught, and as a result, courses in Creative Writing have never been included in the curriculum of Continental universities.

Who are these characters? What do they want? Why do they want it? How do they go about getting it? What stops them? What are the consequences? Finding the answers to these grand questions and shaping them into story is our overwhelming creative task.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story demands both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story demands both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought. Self-expression is never an issue, for, wittingly or unwittingly, all stories, honest and dishonest, wise and foolish, faithfully mirror their maker, exposing his humanity … or lack of it. Compared to this terror, writing dialogue is a sweet diversion.

The idea of story is like the idea of music. We’ve heard tunes all our lives. We can dance and sing along. We think we understand music until we try to compose it and what comes out of the piano scares the cat.

If both TENDER MERCIES and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK are wonderful stories beautifully told for the screen—and they are—what on earth do they have in common? If HANNAH AND HER SISTERS and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL are both brilliant comic stories delightfully told, and they are, where do they touch? Compare THE CRYING GAME to PARENTHOOD, TERMINATOR to REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, UNFORGIVEN to EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. Or A FISH CALLED WANDA to MAN BITES DOG, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT to RESERVOIR DOGS. Moving back through the decades, compare VERTIGO to 8 1/2 to PERSONA to RASHOMON to CASABLANCA to GREED to MODERN TIMES to THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN—all superb screen stories, all vastly different, yet all produce the same result: an audience leaving the theatre exclaiming, “What a great story!”.

“Good story” means something worth telling that the world wants to hear.

It begins with talent. You must be born with the creative power to put things together in a way no one has ever dreamed.

All that … and, as Hallie and Whit Burnett reveal in their excellent little book, a lot of love.

The love of story—the belief that your vision can be expressed only through story, that characters can be more “real” than people, that the fictional world is more profound than the concrete. The love of the dramatic—a fascination with the sudden surprises and revelations that bring sea-changes in life. The love of truth—the belief that lies cripple the artist, that every truth in life must be questioned, down to one’s own secret motives. The love of humanity—a willingness to empathize with suffering souls, to crawl inside their skins and see the world through their eyes. The love of sensation—the desire to indulge not only the physical but the inner senses. The love of dreaming—the pleasure in taking leisurely rides on your imagination just to see where it leads. The love of humor—a joy in the saving grace that restores the balance of life. The love of language—the delight in sound and sense, syntax and semantics. The love of duality—a feel for life’s hidden contradictions, a healthy suspicion that things are not what they seem. The love of perfection—the passion to write and rewrite in pursuit of the perfect moment. The love of uniqueness—the thrill of audacity and a stone-faced calm when it is met by ridicule. The love of beauty—an innate sense that treasures good writing, hates bad writing, and knows the difference. The love of self—a strength that doesn’t need to be constantly reassured, that never doubts that you are indeed a writer. You must love to write and bear the loneliness. But the love of a good story, of terrific characters and a world driven by your passion, courage, and creative gifts is still not enough. Your goal must be a good story well told.

Without craft, the best a writer can do is snatch the first idea off the top of his head, then sit helpless in front of his own work, unable to answer the dreaded questions: Is it good? Or is it sewage? If sewage, what do I do?.

This writer believes that the more precise his observation of day-to-day facts, the more accurate his reportage of what actually happens, the more truth he tells. But fact, no matter how minutely observed, is truth with a small “t.” Big “T” Truth is located behind, beyond, inside, below the surface of things, holding reality together or tearing it apart, and cannot be directly observed. Because this writer sees only what is visible and factual, he is blind to the truth of life.

Story is metaphor for life.

A storyteller is a life poet, an artist who transforms day-to-day living, inner life and outer life, dream and actuality into a poem whose rhyme scheme is events rather than words—a two-hour metaphor that says: Life is like this! Therefore, a story must abstract from life to discover its essences, but not become an abstraction that loses all sense of life-as-lived.

What happens is fact, not truth. Truth is what we think about what happens.

At one end of reality is pure fact; at the other end, pure imagination.

The material of literary talent is words; the material of story talent is life itself.

It’s the currency of human contact.

Master storytellers know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal.

Master storytellers know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal. You may have the insight of a Buddha, but if you cannot tell story, your ideas turn dry as chalk.

The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.

One purpose may be to express your feelings, but this becomes self-indulgence if it doesn’t result in arousing emotions in the audience.

“Event” means change. If the streets outside your window are dry, but after a nap you see they’re wet, you assume an event has taken place, called rain.

STORY VALUES are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive, from one moment to the next.

Alive/dead (positive/negative) is a story value, as are love/hate, freedom/slavery, truth/lie, courage/cowardice, loyalty/betrayal, wisdom/stupidity, strength/weakness, excitement/boredom and so on.

A Story Event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.

Into it comes a man who imagines himself a “rainmaker.” This character has deep inner conflict between his passionate belief that he can bring rain, although he has never been able to do it, and his terrible fear that he’s a fool or mad. He meets a woman, falls in love, then suffers as she tries to believe in him, but turns away, convinced he’s a charlatan or worse. He has a strong conflict with society—some follow him as if he’s a messiah; others want to stone him out of town. Lastly, he faces implacable conflict with the physical world—the hot winds, empty skies, parched earth. If this man can struggle through all his inner and personal conflicts, against social and environmental forces and finally coax rain out of a cloudless sky, that storm would be majestic and sublimely meaningful—for it is change motivated through conflict. What I have described is THE RAINMAKER, adapted to the screen by Richard Nash from his own play.

A SCENE is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character’s life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.

What value is at stake in my character’s life at this moment? Love? Truth? What? How is that value charged at the top of the scene? Positive? Negative? Some of both? Make a note. Next turn to the close of the scene and ask, Where is this value now? Positive? Negative? Both? Make a note and compare. If the answer you write down at the end of the scene is the same note you made at the opening, you now have another important question to ask: Why is this scene in my script?.

The answer is almost certain to be “exposition.” It’s there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience.

The answer is almost certain to be “exposition.” It’s there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience. If exposition is a scene’s sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.

A BEAT is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.

“If I left you, baby, you’d be so miserable …” but he calls her bluff with “That’s a misery I’d love.”.

An ACT is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.

When you look at the value-charged situation in the life of the character at the beginning of the story, then compare it to the value-charge at the end of the story, you should see the arc of the film, the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end. This final condition, this end change, must be absolute and irreversible.

The writer redrafts inspiration again and again, making it look as if an instinctive spontaneity created the film, yet knowing how much effort and unnaturalness went into making it look natural and effortless.

Plot is the writer’s choice of events and their design in time.

A story in which the arc of the film takes place within the mind of the protagonist.

This collection of timeless principles I call the Archplot: Arch (pronounced “ark” as in archangel) in the dictionary sense of “eminent above others of the same kind.”.

A FISH CALLED WANDA.

The Archplot delivers a closed ending—all questions raised by the story are answered; all emotions evoked are satisfied. The audience leaves with a rounded, closed experience—nothing in doubt, nothing unsated.

Most of the emotion evoked by the film will be satisfied, but an emotional residue may be left for the audience to satisfy.

In an ideal world art and politics would never touch. In reality they can’t keep their hands off each other.

The art film’s focus on inner conflict draws the interest of those with advanced degrees, because the inner world is where the highly educated spend a large amount of time.

If the audience shrinks, the budget must shrink. This is the law.

Don’t kid yourself into thinking that you understand Archplot because you’ve seen the movies. You’ll know you understand it when you can do it.

Are you in love with the art in yourself or yourself in the art?.

He avoids closure, active characters, chronology, and causality to avoid the taint of commercialism. As a result, pretentiousness poisons his work.

The writer does not know the world of his story.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own. They reheat literary leftovers and serve up plates of boredom because, regardless of their talents, they lack an in-depth understanding of their story’s setting and all it contains.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own. They reheat literary leftovers and serve up plates of boredom because, regardless of their talents, they lack an in-depth understanding of their story’s setting and all it contains. Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.

Within any world, no matter how imaginary, only certain events are possible or probable.

No matter how realistic or bizarre the setting, once its causal principles are established, they cannot change. In fact, of all genres Fantasy is the most rigid and structurally conventional.

Stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials already in history and human experience.

The smaller the world, the more complete the knowledge of the writer, therefore the greater his creative choices. Result: a fully original story and victory in the war on cliché.

I suggest these specific methods: research of memory, research of imagination, research of fact. Generally, a story needs all three.

You may think you know, but you don’t know you know until you can write it down.

The result is his four basic genres: Simple Tragic, Simple Fortunate, Complex Tragic, Complex Fortunate.

Robert Frost said that writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down, for it’s the self-imposed, indeed artificial demands of poetic conventions that stir the imagination. Let’s say a poet arbitrarily imposes this limit: He decides to write in six-line stanzas, rhyming every other line. After rhyming the fourth line with the second line he reaches the end of a stanza. Backed into this corner, his struggle to rhyme the sixth line with the fourth and second may inspire him to imagine a word that has no relationship to his poem whatsoever—it just happens to rhyme—but this random word then springs loose a phrase that in turn brings an image to mind, an image that in turn resonates back through the first five lines, triggering a whole new sense and feeling, twisting and driving the poem to a richer meaning and emotion. Thanks to the poet’s Creative Limitation of this rhyme scheme, the poem achieves an intensity it would have lacked had the poet allowed himself the freedom to choose any word he wished.

In WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, the lovers suffer from the absurd belief that friendship and love are incompatible.

Hemingway, for example, was fascinated with the question of how to face death. After he witnessed the suicide of his father, it became the central theme, not only of his writing, but of his life. He chased death in war, in sport, on safari, until finally, putting a shotgun in his mouth, he found it.

Charles Dickens, whose father was imprisoned for debt, wrote of the lonely child searching for the lost father over and over in David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations.

Whatever your source of inspiration, beware of this: Long before you finish, the love of self will rot and die, the love of ideas sicken and perish. You’ll become so tired and bored with writing about yourself or your ideas, you may not finish the race.

What seems is not what is. People are not what they appear to be. A hidden nature waits concealed behind a facade of traits.

No matter what they say, no matter how they comport themselves, the only way we ever come to know characters in depth is through their choices under pressure.

“Movies are about their last twenty minutes.”.

Because in life idea and emotion come separately.

The source of all art is the human psyche’s primal, prelinguistic need for the resolution of stress and discord through beauty and harmony, for the use of creativity to revive a life deadened by routine, for a link to reality through our instinctive, sensory feel for the truth.

In life, experiences become meaningful with reflection in time. In art, they are meaningful now, at the instant they happen. In this sense, story is, at heart,.

In life, experiences become meaningful with reflection in time. In art, they are meaningful now, at the instant they happen.

CONTROLLING IDEA may be expressed in a single sentence describing how and why life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another at the end.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence. Or you may think you’re a street-wise guy who’s been around the block a few times until you find yourself writing warm, compassionate endings.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence. Or you may think you’re a street-wise guy who’s been around the block a few times until you find yourself writing warm, compassionate endings. You think you know who you are, but often you’re amazed by what’s skulking inside in need of expression.

The danger is this: When your Premise is an idea you feel you must prove to the world, and you design your story as an undeniable certification of that idea, you set yourself on the road to didacticism. In your zeal to persuade, you will stifle the voice of the other side. Misusing and abusing art to preach, your screenplay will become a thesis film, a thinly disguised sermon as you strive in a single stroke to convert the world.

Make no mistake, no one can achieve excellence as a writer without being something of a philosopher and holding strong convictions.

In 388 B.C. Plato urged the city fathers of Athens to exile all poets and storytellers. They are a threat to society, he argued. Writers deal with ideas, but not in the open, rational manner of philosophers. Instead, they conceal their ideas inside the seductive emotions of art. Yet felt ideas, as Plato pointed out, are ideas nonetheless. Every effective story sends a charged idea out to us, in effect compelling the idea into us, so that we must believe. In fact, the persuasive power of a story is so great that we may believe its meaning even if we find it morally repellent. Storytellers, Plato insisted, are dangerous people. He was right.

Hitler believed he would turn Europe into a paradise once he killed the people who needed killing… and he had his list.

No civilization, including Plato’s, has ever been destroyed because its citizens learned too much truth.

For just as glass is a medium for light, air a medium for sound, language is only a medium, one of many, in fact, for storytelling.

When you think about it, going to the movies is bizarre. Hundreds of strangers sit in a blackened room, elbow to elbow, for two or more hours. They don’t go to the toilet or get a smoke. Instead, they stare wide-eyed at a screen, investing more uninterrupted concentration than they give to work, paying money to suffer emotions they’d do anything to avoid in life. From this perspective, a second question arises: What is the source of story energy? How does it compel such intense mental and sentient attention from the audience? How do stories work?.

Other characters may be dogged, even inflexible, but the protagonist in particular is a willful being.

A story cannot be told about a protagonist who doesn’t want anything, who cannot make decisions, whose actions effect no change at any level.

If you could pull your protagonist aside, whisper in his ear, “What do you want?” he would have an answer: “I’d like X today, Y next week, but in the end I want Z.” The protagonist’s object of desire may be external: the destruction of the shark in JAWS, or internal: maturity in BIG.

The PROTAGONIST may also have a self-contradictory unconscious desire.

What he believes he wants is the antithesis of what he actually but unwittingly wants.

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,” that most people waste their precious time and die with the feeling they’ve fallen short of their dreams. As honest as this painful insight may be, we cannot allow ourselves to believe it. Instead, we carry hope to the end.

The audience wants to be taken to the limit, to where all questions are answered, all emotion satisfied—the end of the line.

The gift of story is the opportunity to live lives beyond our own, to desire and struggle in a myriad of worlds and times, at all the various depths of our being.

In story, we concentrate on that moment, and only that moment, in which a character takes an action expecting a useful reaction from his world, but instead the effect of his action is to provoke forces of antagonism. The world of the character reacts differently than expected, more powerfully than expected, or both.

It takes ten or more years of adult life to find something to say that tens of millions of people want to hear,.

You’re willing to risk people. Each morning you go to your desk and enter the imagined world of your characters. You dream and write until the sun’s setting and your head’s throbbing. So you turn off your word processor to be with the person you love. Except that, while you can turn off your machine, you can’t turn off your imagination. As you sit at dinner, your characters are still running through your head and you’re wishing there was a notepad next to your plate. Sooner or later, the person you love will say: “You know… you’re not really here.” Which is true. Half the time you’re somewhere else, and no one wants to live with somebody who isn’t really there.

The only reliable source of emotional truth is yourself. If you stay outside your characters, you inevitably write emotional clichés.

How to write a scene of insightful emotions? You could ask: How should someone take this action? But that leads to clichés and moralizing. Or you could ask: How might someone do this? But that leads to writing “cute”—clever but dishonest. Or: “If my character were in these circumstances, what would he do?” But that puts you at a distance, picturing your character walking the stage of his life, guessing at his emotions, and guesses are invariably clichés. Or you could ask: “If I were in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

You must doubt appearances and seek the opposite of the obvious.

Rather, peel back the skin of life to find the hidden, the unexpected, the seemingly inappropriate—in other words, the truth. And you will find your truth in the gap.

Writers are by instinct dialectical thinkers. As Jean Cocteau said, “The spirit of creation is the spirit of contradiction—the breakthrough of appearances toward an unknown reality.” You must doubt appearances and seek the opposite of the obvious. Don’t skim the surface, taking things at face value. Rather, peel back the skin of life to find the hidden, the unexpected, the seemingly inappropriate—in other words, the truth. And you will find your truth in the gap.

Consequently, fine writing puts less stress on what happens than on to whom it happens and why and how it happens.

Anything that can be given a free will and the capacity to desire, take action, and suffer the consequences can be a protagonist.

The PROTAGONIST has the will and capacity to pursue the object of his conscious and/or unconscious desire to the end of the line, to the human limit established by setting and genre.

The audience, therefore, expects the storyteller to be an artist of vision who can take his story to those distant depths and ranges.

“This character is like me. Therefore, I want him to have whatever it is he wants, because if I were he in those circumstances, I’d want the same thing for myself.”.

The audience identifies with deep character, with innate qualities revealed through choice under pressure.

Human beings. As the filmgoer looks up on the screen, he recognizes the character’s humanity, senses that he shares it, identifies with the protagonist, and dives into the story. Indeed, in the hands of the greatest writers, even the most unsympathetic character can be made empathetic. Macbeth,.

Macbeth, for example, viewed objectively, is monstrous. He butchers a kindly old King while the man is sleeping, a King who had never done Macbeth any harm—in fact, that very day he’d given Macbeth a royal promotion. Macbeth then murders two servants of the King to blame the deed on them. He kills his best friend. Finally he orders the assassination of the wife and infant children of his enemy. He’s a ruthless killer; yet, in Shakespeare’s hands he becomes a tragic, empathetic hero. The Bard accomplished this feat by giving Macbeth a conscience. As he wanders in soliloquy, wondering, agonizing, “Why am I doing this? What kind of a man am I?” the audience listens and thinks, “What kind? Guilt-ridden… just like me. I feel bad when I’m thinking about doing bad things. I feel awful when I do them and afterward there’s no end to the guilt. Macbeth is a human being; he has a conscience just like mine.” In fact, we’re so drawn to Macbeth’s writhing soul, we feel a tragic loss when at climax Macduff decapitates him. Macbeth is a breathtaking display of the godlike power of the writer to find an empathetic center in an otherwise contemptible character.

So the closest circle of antagonism in the world of a character is his own being: feelings and emotions, mind and body, all or any of which may or may not react from one moment to the next the way he expects.

Not until we set the conventional role aside do we find the true intimacy of family, friends, and lovers—who then do not react the way we expect and become the second level of personal conflict.

We all walk this earth thinking, or at least hoping, that we understand ourselves, our intimates, society, and the world.

But this is a truth we cannot know absolutely. It’s what we believe to be true.

As in life, so in fiction. When objective necessity contradicts a character’s sense of probability, a gap suddenly cracks open in the fictional reality. This gap is the point where the subjective and objective realms collide, the difference between anticipation and result, between the world as the character perceived it before acting and the truth he discovers in action.

Life teaches that the measure of the value of any human desire is in direct proportion to the risk involved in its pursuit.

For we not only create stories as metaphors for life, we create them as metaphors for meaningful life—and to live meaningfully is to be at perpetual risk.

The measure of the value of a character’s desire is in direct proportion to the risk he’s willing to take to achieve it; the greater the value, the greater the risk.

How, as you sit at your desk, do you crawl inside the head of your character to feel your heart pounding, your palms sweating, a knot in your belly, tears in your eyes, laughter in your heart, sexual arousal, anger, outrage, compassion, sadness, joy, or any of the uncountable responses along the spectrum of human emotions?.

You ask: “If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

How to write a scene of insightful emotions? You could ask: How should someone take this action? But that leads to clichés and moralizing. Or you could ask: How might someone do this? But that leads to writing “cute”—clever but dishonest. Or: “If my character were in these circumstances, what would he do?” But that puts you at a distance, picturing your character walking the stage of his life, guessing at his emotions, and guesses are invariably clichés. Or you could ask: “If I were in these circumstances, what would I do?” As this question plays on your imagination, it may start your heart pounding, but obviously you’re not the character. Although it may be an honest emotion for you, your character might do the reverse. So what do you do? You ask: “If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

“If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

The substance of story is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen; the rift between expectation and result, probability and necessity. To build a scene, we constantly break open these breaches in reality.

The substance of story is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen; the rift between expectation and result, probability and necessity. To build a scene, we constantly break open these breaches in reality. As to the source of energy in story, the answer is the same: the gap. The audience empathizes with the character, vicariously seeking his desire. It more or less expects the world to react the way the character expects. When the gap opens up for character, it opens up for audience. This is the “Oh, my God!” moment, the “Oh, no!” or “Oh, yes!” you’ve experienced again and again in well-crafted stories.

We’ve defined setting in terms of period,.

We’ve defined setting in terms of period, duration, location, and level of conflict.

“He who confesses first loses.” The first person to say “I love you” has lost because the other, upon hearing it, immediately smiles a knowing smile, realizing that he’s the one loved, so he now controls the relationship. If you’re lucky, those three little words will be said in unison over candlelight. Or, if very, very lucky, they won’t need to be said… they’ll be done.

If two characters in your cast share the same attitude and react in kind to whatever occurs, you must either collapse the two into one, or expel one from the story. When characters react the same, you minimize opportunities for conflict. Instead, the writer’s strategy must be to maximize these opportunities.

If we both share the same views, then one of us can be let go of the story.

If, on the other hand, we notice that she’s created an ingenious kitchen wallpaper from hundreds of parking tickets, then a sudden POUNDING on the door brings the police, brandishing a felony warrant for ten thousand dollars in unpaid citations, and she flees down the fire escape, heading West—this could be an Inciting Incident. It has done what an Inciting Incident must do.

The INCITING INCIDENT radically upsets the balance of forces in the protagonist’s life.

But for those protagonists we tend to admire the most, the Inciting Incident arouses not only a conscious desire, but an unconscious one as well. These complex characters suffer intense inner battles because these two desires are in direct conflict with each other. No matter what the character consciously thinks he wants, the audience senses or realizes that deep inside he unconsciously wants the very opposite.

He thinks he’s hunting for the perfect woman, but we know that unconsciously he wants to degrade and destroy women and has done that throughout his life.

Fergus harbors the most human of needs: to love and be loved.

If, on the other hand, the protagonist has an unconscious desire, this becomes the Spine of the story. An unconscious desire is always more powerful and durable, with roots reaching to the protagonist’s innermost self. When an unconscious desire drives the story, it allows the writer to create a far more complex character who may repeatedly change his conscious desire.

For better or worse, an event throws a character’s life out of balance, arousing in him the conscious and/or unconscious desire for that which he feels will restore balance, launching him on a Quest for his Object of Desire against forces of antagonism (inner, personal, extra-personal). He may or may not achieve it. This is story in a nutshell.

The essential form of story is simple. But that’s like saying that the essential form of music is simple. It is. It’s twelve notes. But these twelve notes conspire into everything and anything we have ever called music.

The essential form of story is simple. But that’s like saying that the essential form of music is simple. It is. It’s twelve notes. But these twelve notes conspire into everything and anything we have ever called music. The essential elements of the Quest are the twelve notes of our music, the melody we’ve listened to all our lives. However, like the composer sitting down at the piano, when a writer takes up this seemingly simple form, he discovers how incredibly complex it is, how inordinately difficult to do.

The scene is called “obligatory” because having teased the audience into anticipating this moment, the writer is obligated to keep his promise and show it to them.

The primary component of foreshadowing, however, is the projection of the Obligatory Scene (Crisis) into the audience’s imaginaton by the Inciting Incident.

A story must not retreat to actions of lesser quality or magnitude, but move progressively forward to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.

The only way to keep a film’s current flowing and rising is research—imagination, memory, fact.

To create forty to sixty scenes and not repeat yourself, you need to invent hundreds.

Nothing moves forward in a story except through conflict.

Put another way, conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music.

Put another way, conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music. Both story and music are temporal arts, and the single most difficult task of the temporal artist is to hook our interest, hold our uninterrupted concentration, then carry us through time without an awareness of the passage of time.

As Jean-Paul Sartre expressed it, the essence of reality is scarcity, a universal and eternal lacking.

Time, as Heidegger observed, is the basic category of existence. We live in its ever-shrinking shadow, and if we are to achieve anything in our brief being that lets us die without feeling we’ve wasted our time, we will have to go into heady conflict with the forces of scarcity that deny our desires.

Their scripts fail for one of two reasons: either a glut of meaningless and absurdly violent conflict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed conflict.

The latter are tedious portraits written in reaction against conflict itself. These writers take the Pollyanna view that life would really be nice… if it weren’t for conflict. Therefore, their films avoid it in favor of low-key depictions to suggest that if we learned to communicate a little better, be a little more charitable, respect the environment, humanity could return to paradise. But if history has taught us anything, it’s that when toxic nightmare is finally cleaned up, the homeless provided shelter, and the world converted to solar energy, each of us will still be up to our eyebrows in mulch.

Writers at these extremes fail to realize that while the quality of conflict changes as it shifts from level to level, the quantity of conflict in life is constant. Something is always lacking. Like squeezing a balloon, the volume of conflict never changes, it just bulges in another direction. When we remove conflict from one level of life, it amplifies ten times over on another level.

Boredom is the inner conflict we suffer when we lose desire, when we lack a lacking.

Once housed, dressed, fed, and medicated, we take a breath and realize how incomplete we are as human beings.

Once housed, dressed, fed, and medicated, we take a breath and realize how incomplete we are as human beings. We want more than physical comfort, we want, of all things, happiness, and so begin the wars of the inner life.

Death is like a freight train in the future, heading toward us, closing the hours, second by second, between now and then.

Life is about the ultimate questions of finding love and self-worth, of bringing serenity to inner chaos, of the titanic social inequities everywhere around us, of time running out. Life is conflict. That is its nature. The writer must decide where and how to orchestrate this struggle.

“Love cuts two ways: we possess it when we give it freedom, but destroy it with possessiveness.”.

Love is a strange thing, it can only be possessed by surrendering possessiveness.

All parents can do is love their children, support them, pick them up when they fall. But there’s no such thing as winning this game.

A novelist can enter a character’s mind and in first- or third-person delineate inner conflict directly in prose description.

A writer secure in his talent knows there’s no limit to what he can create, and so he trashes everything less than his best on a quest for a gem-quality story.

“With enthusiasm” doesn’t mean people leap up and kiss you on both cheeks, rather they whisper “Wow” and fall silent. A fine work of art—music, dance, painting, story—has the power to silence the chatter in the mind and lift us to another place. When a story, pitched from a step-outline, is so strong it brings silence—no comments, no criticism, just a look of pleasure—that’s a hell of a thing and time is too precious to waste on a story that hasn’t that power. Now the writer’s ready to move to the next stage—the treatment.

We may think we know what our characters are thinking and feeling, but we don’t know we know until we write it down:.

“Tell me something I don’t know.”.

To tell story is to make a promise: If you give me your concentration, I’ll give you surprise followed by the pleasure of discovering life, its pains and joys, at levels and in directions you have never imagined. And most important, this must be done with such seeming ease and naturalness that we lead the audience to these discoveries as if spontaneously. The effect of a beautifully turned moment is that filmgoers experience a rush of knowledge as if they did it for themselves.

Insight is the audience’s reward for paying attention, and a beautifully designed story delivers this pleasure scene after scene after scene.

Here the writer opens his arms to the world, saying: “This is my vision of life, of the nature of the human beings that inhabit my world. This is what I think happens to people in these circumstances for these reasons. My ideas, my emotions. Me.” Our most powerful means of self-expression is the unique way we turn the story.

This is why weak storytelling resorts to substituting information for insight.

Language is a tool for self-expression and must never become a decorative end of its own.

To set up means to layer in knowledge; to pay off means to close the gap by delivering that knowledge to the audience.

Prison compound and discovers a makeshift.

Life, is just a makeshift.

Makeshift.

Turning Points fail when we overprepare the obvious and underprepare the unusual.

Bergman, for example, is difficult for the young—not because they couldn’t grasp his ideas if they were explained, but because Bergman never explains.

Once the setup closes the gap, that payoff will, in all probability, become yet another setup for payoffs ahead.

The understanding of how we create the audience’s emotional experience begins with the realization that there are only two emotions—pleasure and pain. Each has its variations: joy, love, happiness, rapture, fun, ecstasy, thrill, bliss, and many others on one hand, and anguish, dread, anxiety, terror, grief, humiliation, malaise, misery, stress, remorse, and many others on the other hand. But at heart life gives us only one or the other.

If we do not understand that much about human nature—that a human being is only capable of acting toward the right or the good as he has come to believe it or rationalize it—then we understand very little. Good/evil, right/wrong choices are dramatically obvious and trivial.

True choice is dilemma. It occurs in two situations. First, a choice between irreconcilable goods: From the character’s view two things are desirable, he wants both, but circumstances are forcing him to choose only one. Second, a choice between the lesser of two evils: From the character’s view two things are undesirable, he wants neither, but circumstances are forcing him to choose one. How a character chooses in a true dilemma is a powerful expression of his humanity and of the world in which he lives. Writers.

“She’ll come back. She always did.”.

“I stick my neck out for no man.”.

A story, even when expressing chaos, must be unified. This sentence, drawn from any plot, should be logical: “Because of the Inciting Incident, the Climax had to happen.”.

The Inciting Incident is the story’s most profound cause, and, therefore, the final effect, the Story Climax, should seem inevitable.

The cement that binds them is the Spine, the protagonist’s deep desire to restore the balance of life.

CASABLANCA, for example, is not only one of the most loved films of all time, it’s also one of the most various. It’s a brilliant Love Story, but more than half the film is Political Drama. Its excellent action sequences are counter-pointed by urbane comedy. And it’s the next thing to a Musical. Over a dozen tunes, strategically placed throughout, comment on or set up event, meaning, emotion.

Instead, we seek the tragic in the comic, the political in the personal, the personal driving the political, the extraordinary behind the usual, the trivial in the exalted.

This rhythm beats between two contradictory desires: On one hand, we desire serenity, harmony, peace, and relaxation, but too much of this day after day and we become bored to the point of ennui and need therapy.

This rhythm beats between two contradictory desires: On one hand, we desire serenity, harmony, peace, and relaxation, but too much of this day after day and we become bored to the point of ennui and need therapy. As a result, we also desire challenge, tension, danger, even fear. But too much of this day after day and again we end up in the rubber room. So the rhythm of life swings between these poles.

We moan about traffic but never do anything about it because, in truth, we secretly enjoy rush hour; drive-time is the only time most of us are ever alone. You relax, scratch what needs scratching, and add a primal scream to the music.

You escape into your car, snap on the radio, and get in the proper lane according to the music. If classical, you hug the right; if pop, down the middle of the road; if rock, head left. We moan about traffic but never do anything about it because, in truth, we secretly enjoy rush hour; drive-time is the only time most of us are ever alone. You relax, scratch what needs scratching, and add a primal scream to the music.

As Andre (Andre Gregory) relates his quixotic adventure toward spiritual development, he so cants his friend’s view of life that Wally (Wallace Shawn) leaves.

This is why we tend to tell stories about lawyers, doctors, warriors, politicians, scientists—people so positioned in society by profession that if something goes haywire in their private lives, the writer can expand the action into society.

This principle of starting with intimate problems that ramify outward into the world to build powerful progressions explains why certain professions are overrepresented in the roles of protagonists. This is why we tend to tell stories about lawyers, doctors, warriors, politicians, scientists—people so positioned in society by profession that if something goes haywire in their private lives, the writer can expand the action into society.

Imagine a story that begins like this: The President of the United States gets up one morning to shave and as he stares in the mirror, he hallucinates about imaginary enemies around the globe. He tells no one, but soon his wife realizes he’s gone mad. His close associates too. They gather and decide that since he has only six months left in office, why spoil things now? They’ll cover up for him. But we know he has “his finger on the button” and a madman in this position could turn our troubled world into universal hell.

If the logic of your setting doesn’t allow you to go wide, then you must go deep.

If the logic of your setting doesn’t allow you to go wide, then you must go deep. Start with a personal or inner conflict that demands balancing, yet seems relatively solvable. Then, as the work progresses, hammer the story downward—emotionally, psychologically, physically, morally—to the dark secrets, the unspoken truths that hide behind a public mask.

ORDINARY PEOPLE is confined to the family, a friend, and a doctor. From a tension between mother and son that seems solvable with communication and love, it descends to grievous pain. As the father slowly comes to realize he must choose between the sanity of his son and the unity of his family, the story drives the child to the brink of suicide, the mother to reveal her hatred of her own child, and the husband to lose a wife he deeply loves.

A good story well told fosters a good film. But a good story well told with the added power of subliminal symbolism lifts the telling to the next level of expressivity, and the payoff may be a great film.

We save our own humanity when we stop killing other living beings.

If the hunter spills enough blood, sooner or later he runs out of targets and turns the gun on himself.

He either literally kills himself, as does Nick (Christopher Walken), or more likely, he kills himself in the sense that he stops feeling anything and falls dead inside.

An archetypal image: hunter and prey at the top of a mountain. Why the top of a mountain? Because tops of mountains are places where “great things happen.”.

“Ah, life is just like that.” It.

“Ah, life is just like that.” It sees life in duality; it plays with our paradoxical existence, aware of the bottomless chasm between what seems and what is.

Susan’s persistence pays off as she transforms David from fossilized child to life-embracing adult.

If I could send a telegram to the film producers of the world, it would be these three words: “Meaning Produces Emotion.”.

A revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony—a value swing at maximum charge that’s absolute and irreversible. The meaning of that change moves the heart of the audience.

The flow of life moves from cause to effect, but the flow of creativity often flows from effect to cause.

The key to all story endings is to give the audience what it wants, but not the way it expects.

But if we were to look closely, we’d discover that they not only avoid negative emotions in movies, they avoid them in life.

In fact, down-ending films are often huge commercial successes: DANGEROUS LIAISONS, eighty million dollars; THE WAR OF THE ROSES, one hundred fifty million; THE ENGLISH PATIENT, two hundred twenty-five million. No one can count THE GODFATHER, PART II’s money.

Michael forgives Fredo, quits the mob, and moves to Boston with his family to sell insurance? The Climax of this magnificent film is truthful, beautiful, and very satisfying.

Anyone can deliver a happy ending—just give the characters everything they want. Or a downer—just kill everybody. An artist gives us the emotion he’s promised… but with a rush of unexpected insight that he’s withheld to a Turning Point within the Climax itself.

Anyone can deliver a happy ending—just give the characters everything they want. Or a downer—just kill everybody. An artist gives us the emotion he’s promised… but with a rush of unexpected insight that he’s withheld to a Turning Point within the Climax itself. So that as the protagonist improvises his final effort, he may or may not achieve his desire, but the flood of insight that pours from the gap delivers the hoped-for emotion but in a way we could never have foreseen.

The story’s emotional heart is in the main plot.

The audience, however, has come to know many supporting roles whose lives will be changed by the climactic action.

A film needs what the theatre calls a “slow curtain.” A line of description at the bottom of the last page that sends the camera slowly back or tracking along images for a few seconds, so the audience can catch its breath, gather its thoughts, and leave the cinema with dignity.

The first draft of anything is shit. — ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

(I don’t have nothing never!).

The Contradictory, however, is not the limit of human experience. At the end of the line waits the Negation of the Negation, a force of antagonism that’s doubly negative.

Our subject is life, not arithmetic. In life two negatives don’t make a positive. In English double negatives are ungrammatical, but Italian uses double and even triple negatives so that a statement feels like its meaning. In anguish an Italian might say, “Non ho niente mia!” (I don’t have nothing never!). Italians know life.

Chile is in the grip of tyranny. The generals can make illegal on Tuesday what you did legally on Monday, arrest you for it on Wednesday, execute you on Thursday, and make it legal again Friday morning.

Although Horman couldn’t indict the tyrants in Chile, he exposed them onscreen in front of the world—which may be a sweeter kind of justice.

To hate other people is bad enough, but even a misanthrope loves one person. When self-love vanishes and a character loathes his own being, he reaches the Negation of the Negation and existence becomes a living hell: Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

Many parents hate their children, many children hate their parents, and they fight and scream and say it. In these fine films, although a parent bitterly resents and secretly hates his or her child, they pretend to love him. When the antagonist adds that lie, the story moves to the Negation of the Negation. How can a child defend himself against that?.

The first form of hatred is masquerading as love.

For if we reveal too much too soon, the audience will see the climaxes coming long before they arrive.

Reveal only that exposition the audience absolutely needs and wants to know and no more.

Put the question “Why?” in the filmgoer’s mind. “Why is this character behaving this way? Why doesn’t this or that happen? Why?” With a hunger for information, even the most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.

They stand to lose what they have in their struggle to achieve a rebalancing of existence.

If you can thoroughly dramatize exposition and make it invisible, if you can control its disclosure, parsing it out only when and if the audience needs and wants to know it, saving the best for last, you’re learning your craft. But what’s a problem for beginning writers becomes an invaluable asset to those who know the craft. Rather than avoiding exposition by giving their characters an anonymous past, they go out of their way to salt their biographies with significant events. Because what is the challenge that the storyteller faces dozens of times over in the telling? How to turn the scene. How to create Turning Points.

We can turn scenes only one of two ways: on action or on revelation. There are no other means.

Powerful revelations come from the BACKSTORY—previous significant events in the lives of the characters that the writer can reveal at critical moments to create Turning Points.

Agatha Christie, however, opens her stories with only the second half—a closet door opens and a body falls out. By starting with the discovery of the crime, she arouses curiosity in two directions: Into the past, how and why was the murder committed? Into the future, which of the many suspects did it? Tarantino’s.

The Inciting Incident of a Murder Mystery combines two events: A murder is committed; the protagonist discovers the crime. Agatha Christie, however, opens her stories with only the second half—a closet door opens and a body falls out. By starting with the discovery of the crime, she arouses curiosity in two directions: Into the past, how and why was the murder committed? Into the future, which of the many suspects did it?.

Second, do not bring in a flashback until you have created in the audience the need and desire to know.

The prose writer can, if he wishes, walk a character past a shop window, have him look inside and remember his entire childhood: “He was walking through his hometown that afternoon when he glanced over at the barbershop and remembered the days when his father would take him there as a boy and he’d sit among the old-timers as they smoked cigars and talked about baseball. It was there that he first heard the word ‘sex’ and ever since he’s unable to sleep with a woman without thinking he was hitting a home run.”.

To study the skillful design of exposition, I suggest a close analysis of JFK. Obtain Oliver Stone’s screenplay and/or the video and break the film down, scene by scene, listing all the facts, indisputable or alleged, it contains. Then note how Stone splintered this Mount Everest of information into its vital pieces, dramatized each bit, pacing the progression of revelations. It is a masterpiece of craftsmanship.

We may make the audience cry or laugh, but above all, as Charles Reade noted, we make it wait.

Mafia logic runs like this: “People want prostitution, narcotics, and illicit gambling. When they’re in trouble, they want to bribe police and judges. They want to taste the fruits of crime, but they’re lying hypocrites and won’t admit it. We provide these services but we’re not hypocrites. We deal in realities. We are the ‘good’ people.” Mr. Coney Island was a conscienceless assassin, but inside he was convinced he was good.

The loyalty of the Godfather’s family makes them the good bad guys. When we spot this positive quality, our emotions move toward it and we find ourselves in empathy with gangsters.

THE GODFATHER: Not only is the Corleone family corrupt, but so too are the other mafia families, even the police and judges. Everyone in this film is a criminal or related to one. But the Corleones have one positive quality—loyalty. In other mob clans gangsters stab one another in the back. That makes them the bad bad guys. The loyalty of the Godfather’s family makes them the good bad guys. When we spot this positive quality, our emotions move toward it and we find ourselves in empathy with gangsters.

This moral management draws the audience into empathy, feeling, “If I had to lead a life of crime, I’d want to be like Cody Jarrett.”.

In Dramatic Irony the audience knows more than the characters.

“Don’t worry, folks, if you stick with me through this boring stretch, I’ll eventually get back to the exciting stuff.”.

“Please, let it be good. Let it give me an experience I’ve never had, insights into a fresh truth. Let me laugh at something I’ve never thought funny. Let me be moved by something that’s never touched me before. Let me see the world in a new way. Amen.”.

“To be about to act and not to act is the worst. It is shocking without being tragic.”.

We all hurt people inadvertently but instantly regret it. But when someone purposely seeks to cause pain in others and takes pleasure from it, that’s evil.

Therefore, the first principle of adaptation: The purer the novel, the purer the play, the worse the film. “Literary purity” does.

Therefore, the first principle of adaptation: The purer the novel, the purer the play, the worse the film.

As William Faulkner observed, human nature is the only subject that doesn’t date.

We know characters better than we know our friends because a character is eternal and unchanging, while people shift—just when we think we understand them, we don’t.

We know characters better than we know our friends because a character is eternal and unchanging, while people shift—just when we think we understand them, we don’t. In fact, I know Rick Blaine in CASABLANCA better than I know myself. Rick is always Rick. I’m a bit iffy.

TRUE CHARACTER can only be expressed through choice in dilemma. How the person chooses to act under pressure is who he is—the greater the pressure, the truer and deeper the choice to character.

The key to True Character is desire. In life, if we feel stifled, the fastest way to get unstuck is to ask, “What do I want?,” listen to the honest answer, then find the will to pursue that desire. Problems still remain, but now we’re in motion with the chance of solving them.

Behind desire is motivation. Why does your character want what he wants? You have your ideas about motive, but don’t be surprised if others see it differently. A friend may feel that parental upbringing shaped your character’s desires; someone else may think it’s our materialist culture; another may blame the school system; yet another may claim it’s in the genes; still another thinks he’s possessed by the devil. Contemporary attitudes tend to favor mono-explanations for behavior, rather than the complexity of forces that’s more likely the case.

Generally, the more the writer nails motivation to specific causes, the more he diminishes the character in the audience’s mind.

Placing a conventional personality against an exotic background, or a strange, mysterious individual within an ordinary, down-to-earth society immediately generates interest.

Don’t cause false anticipation by making bit parts more interesting than necessary.

But that’s okay because conversation isn’t about making points or achieving closure. It’s what psychologists call “keeping the channel open.” Talk is how we develop and change relationships.

When two friends meet on the street and talk about the weather, don’t we know that theirs isn’t a conversation about the weather? What is being said? “I’m your friend. Let’s take a minute out of our busy day and stand here in each other’s presence and reaffirm that we are indeed friends.”.

What is said and done is not what is thought and felt.

First, screen dialogue requires compression and economy. Screen dialogue must say the maximum in the fewest possible words. Second, it must have direction. Each exchange of dialogue must turn the beats of the scene in one direction or another across the changing behaviors, without repetition. Third, it should have purpose. Each line or exchange of dialogue executes a step in design that builds and arcs a scene around its Turning Point. All this precision, yet it must sound like talk, using an informal and natural vocabulary, complete with contractions, slang, and even, if necessary, profanity. “Speak as common people do,” Aristotle advised, “but think as wise men do.”.

Here’s what Bergman gave us: The waiter walks to the table and accidentally on purpose drops the napkin on the floor. As he bends to pick it up, he slowly sniffs and smells Anna from head to crotch to foot. She, in reaction, draws a long, slow, almost delirious breath. CUT TO: They’re in a hotel room. Perfect, isn’t it? Erotic, purely visual, not a word said or necessary. That’s screenwriting.

The same applies to verbs. A typical line of nondescription: “He starts to move slowly across the room.” How does somebody “start” across a room on film? The character either crosses or takes a step and stops. And “move slowly”? “Slowly” is an adverb; “move” a vague, bland verb. Instead, name the action: “He pads across the room.” “He (ambles, strolls, moseys, saunters, drags himself, staggers, waltzes, glides, lumbers, tiptoes, creeps, slouches, shuffles, waddles, minces, trudges, teeters, lurches, gropes, hobbles) across the room.”.

Not “The carpenter uses a big nail,” but “The carpenter hammers a spike.” “Nail” is a generic noun, “big” an adjective. The solid, Anglo-Saxon “spike” pops a vivid image in the reader’s mind, “nail” a blur. How big?.

Eliminate “is” and “are” throughout. Onscreen nothing is in a state of being; story life is an unending flux of change, of becoming. Not: “There is a big house on a hill above a small town.” “There is,” “They are,” “It is,” “He/She is” are the weakest possible ways into any English sentence. And what’s a “big house”? Chateau? Hacienda? A “hill”? Ridge? Bluff? A “small town”? Crossroads? Hamlet? Perhaps: “A mansion guards the headlands above the village.” With a Hemingwayesque shunning of Latinate and abstrate terms, of adjectives and adverbs, in favor of the most specific, active verbs and concrete nouns possible, even establishing shots come alive. Fine film description requires an imagination and a vocabulary.

“The sun sets like a tiger’s eye closing in the jungle,” and,.

They are director traps, seductive but unphotographable.

“You guessed it. Here comes the sex scene. I’d write it, but my mother reads these things.”.

“History is the symptom, we are the disease.”.

A struggling writer may at times produce quality, but from day to day he cannot make his talent perform when and as he wants, doesn’t progress in quality from story to story, and receives little, if any, income from his efforts.

If, hypothetically and optimistically, a screenplay can be written from first idea to last draft in six months, these writers typically spend the first four of those six months writing on stacks of three-by-five cards: a stack for each act—three, four, perhaps more. On these cards they create the story’s step-outline.

This process, however, doesn’t mean the writer isn’t filling pages. Day after day a huge stack grows on the side of the desk: but these are biographies, the fictional world and its history, thematic notations, images, even snippets of vocabulary and idiom.

This process, however, doesn’t mean the writer isn’t filling pages. Day after day a huge stack grows on the side of the desk: but these are biographies, the fictional world and its history, thematic notations, images, even snippets of vocabulary and idiom. Research and imaginings of all kinds fill a file cabinet while the story is disciplined to the step-outline.

Everything that’s wrong with it in a ten-minute pitch is ten times worse onscreen.

They don’t all sound like one another and they don’t all sound like the writer.

But in their secret selves they know they’re just taking talent for a walk.

High above the forest floor, a millipede strolled along the branch of a tree, her thousand pairs of legs swinging in an easy gait. From the tree top, song birds looked down, fascinated by the synchronization of the millipede’s stride. “That’s an amazing talent,” chirped the songbirds. “You have more limbs than we can count. How do you do it?” And for the first time in her life the millipede thought about this. “Yes,” she wondered, “how do I do what I do?” As she turned to look back, her bristling legs suddenly ran into one another and tangled like vines of ivy. The songbirds laughed as the millipede, in a panic of confusion, twisted herself into a knot and fell to the earth below.

On the forest floor, the millipede, realizing that only her pride was hurt, slowly, carefully, limb by limb, unraveled herself. With patience and hard work, she studied and flexed and tested her appendages, until she was able to stand and walk. What was once instinct became knowledge. She realized she didn’t have to move at her old, slow, rote pace. She could amble, strut, prance, even run and jump. Then, as never before, she listened to the symphony of the songbirds and let music touch her heart. Now in perfect command of thousands of talented legs, she gathered courage and, with a style of her own, danced and danced a dazzling dance that astonished all the creatures of her world.

Anticipate. The effect is to crack open the gap between expectation and result, turning his outer fortunes, inner life, or both from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive in terms of values the audience understands are at risk.

Superman is not his powers. Superman is his weaknesses.

The Lord of the Rings is not, when you boil it down, about Gandalf’s magical powers or even Aragorn’s orc-slaying skills. It’s about the Hobbits, arguably the weakest (physically and magically) of the people in the books. It’s about Aragorn’s struggle to become king.

# A Manual for Heartache (Cathy Rentzenbrink)

Perhaps heartbreak is what happens on impact, and heartache is what we are left with as time passes, once the dust settles, when we are able to look up and around us but are still shrouded in sadness.

There were times in my past when I didn’t want to be alive. I thought my heart couldn’t bear the pain of the world and might one day just refuse to beat.

I thought I knew what my life was going to be like and now I don’t.’.

We try to impose a hierarchy on pain is really unhelpful for people who are suffering,.

I told them about Maya Angelou, how she said that there is no greater agony than carrying around an untold story.

We worry that if people knew what we were really like, they’d run away.

It’s too easy to let fear of saying the wrong thing lead to not saying anything at all.

People in distress may well take offence easily because they cannot be pleased. Our main duty is to let them and not take offence back.

If there is ever a time to seek meaning in tragedy – and I’m not sure there is – it certainly isn’t in the immediate aftermath.

Perhaps we need to accept that we don’t have the power to fix anyone, but could just be there for them with love.

When Matty and I were little and were trying to figure out the meaning of love, we decided that it meant you’d cry if someone died. And maybe that is it. I loved him, he died, and for years, I cried.

I used to be frightened of loving people because I thought I wouldn’t survive losing them, but now I see that making friends with grief, accepting it as part of being human, will liberate me to love even more, and that the love is always worth it.

As I watched myself on the screen say that reading was my only solace during dark times, that I found books easier to deal with than life, I realized that anyone with any knowledge of depression would know what I was talking about.

We don’t want to embarrass people or make them feel worried or miserable, so we create a version of ourselves that we think they will want to see.

The mind is simply another part of the body. It works hard, deserves our care and we shouldn’t feel ashamed about needing to give it some attention.

I rather like being disagreed with in real life – I don’t think I’m always right and enjoy having my ideas tested – but I can’t cope with it online. I’m not sure why it feels so brutal. Perhaps it’s the absence of eye contact, or the spectre of an unseen audience, but I find it anxiety-inducing.

No matter what happens, we always have dominion over ourselves.

A boggart is a monster that assumes the shape of the thing you fear most.

It’s quite something to realize that you can have power and influence over your own thoughts and moods. This is so important, as the terror of depression is that it might descend unbidden at any moment.

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows you nothing more nor less than your heart’s desire. The happiest person in the world, Dumbledore explains, would see only themselves, as they are.

What I’ve come to see is not that things happen for a reason, but that there is some sort of trick whereby you can look at your mangled wreckage and from it craft meaning and purpose.

‘So shines a good deed in a naughty world.’.

Josephine Hart, in her novel of that name, suggests that damaged people are dangerous because they know they will survive.

A lot of growing up is about learning to hide how you are feeling so you can protect yourself, and then a lot about being really grown-up is unpicking all those defensive measures and working out who you actually want to be. But for now . . . Kids.

A lot of growing up is about learning to hide how you are feeling so you can protect yourself, and then a lot about being really grown-up is unpicking all those defensive measures and working out who you actually want to be.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it is.

‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’.

When I can’t decide whether or not to do something, I ask myself what I will wish I’d done at the end of my long life.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time. I will.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time.

It is, we know, better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.


# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams)

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

This is not her story.

First, it is slightly cheaper; and second, it has the words DON’T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.

The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.

Ford Prefect usually played to lose.

He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.

What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn’t matter a pair of dingo’s kidneys whether Arthur’s house got knocked down or not now.

“Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”.

“Very deep,” said Arthur, “you should send that in to the Reader’s Digest. They’ve got a page for people like you.” “Drink up.”.

“Drink up,” said Ford, “you’ve got three pints to get through.” “Three pints?” said Arthur. “At lunchtime?” The man next to Ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.” “Very deep,” said Arthur, “you should send that in to the Reader’s Digest. They’ve got a page for people like you.” “Drink up.”.

“Did I do anything wrong today,” he said, “or has the world always been like this and I’ve been too wrapped up in myself to notice?”.

He knew where his towel was.

(a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the color blue).

Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.

Emperor—an elected governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly.

His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.

One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in It’s a nice day, or You’re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you all right? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behavior. If human beings don’t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.

After a few months’ consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one. If they don’t keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.

After a few months’ consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one. If they don’t keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried abut the terrible number of things they didn’t know about.

“Ah,” said Arthur, “this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn’t previously aware of.”.

Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy.

“Charming man,” he said. “I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one …”.

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a fina and clinching proof of the nonexistence of God. “The argument goes something like this: ‘I refuse to prove that I exist,’ says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.’ “‘But,’ says Man, ‘the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn’t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don’t. QED.’.

“I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or …” he paused for melodramatic effect, “tell me how good you thought my poem was!”.

“So what you’re saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved,” he said. He paused, “Is that right?”.

“I don’t want to die now!” he yelled. “I’ve still got a headache! I don’t want to go to heaven with a headache, I’d be all cross and wouldn’t enjoy it!”.

“Death’s too good for them,” he said.

(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete while on the planet is surgically removed from your body weight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory there it is vitally important to get a receipt.).

Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars.

“Ford!” he said, “there’s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they’ve worked out.”.

Many respectable physicists said that they weren’t going to stand for this, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn’t get invited to those sorts of parties.

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute’s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn’t stand was a smart-ass.

Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did.

“‘All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.’”.

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn’t be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn’t understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so—but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He preferred people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it.

“Funny,” he intoned funereally, “how just when you think life can’t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.”.

Either the climate wasn’t quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

What do I mean by who am I?.

“But what are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?” “You think you’ve got problems,” said Marvin, as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, “what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don’t bother to answer that, I’m fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don’t know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.”.

Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it.

It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.

There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?.

Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don’t get up and go to work?.

“Maybe. Who cares?” said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. “Perhaps I’m old and tired,” he continued, “but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.”.

“You know,” said Arthur thoughtfully, “all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I’ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was.” “No,” said the old man, “that’s just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that.” “Everyone?” said Arthur. “Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know …” “Maybe. Who cares?” said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. “Perhaps I’m old and tired,” he continued, “but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.”.

“The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.

“For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?”.


# Modern Love (Unknown)

Vulnerability is the animating quality of all love stories, and it can take many forms.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery. Desire makes one feel vulnerable, which then requires one to be brave.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery. Or a lot.

“We get so fixated on the job we want or the person we’re dating because we don’t think there will be another. But there’s always another.”.

I traced it with my finger, from just below her armpit, over the speed bumps of her ribs, to her hip bone.

She had a boyfriend, so we couldn’t date, but we chatted online, learning about each other’s lives while we traded YouTube clips of our favorite Saturday Night Live sketches.

We sat so close I could smell her sweat, though the chemicals of infatuation turned it into a sweet perfume.

I secretly enjoy doing my taxes.

(Shocker: People’s feelings are never wrong.).

She thanked me for the flowers and didn’t even mention the letter. I knew then our relationship was over.

Because fixing something, especially when it’s a person, is what makes a man feel most valuable.

In the movies the romantic gesture works, but it failed me in real life. This was like Diane Court coming to the window only to shut it so she could go back to sleep. I gave her my heart; she thanked me for the $12.99 flowers.

“Happily ever after” is too boring for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

She was simply someone who had fallen out of love with her boyfriend. Which happens. It’s really uncinematic, but it happens.

I don’t very much like not being liked very much!”.

“I’d like to see how this experiment turns out,” I wrote in conclusion. “The question is, do you?”.

Even though I was riding in an ambulance to surgery, that one still stung.

We came up with an absurd screenplay idea, a horror movie set in a hospital.

I felt like a ghost returning to the scene of my own murder.

Sometimes when a guy really likes a girl, he gets a tattoo on his arm. I got this prominent scar instead. But there are times when I finger its deep groove (a new nervous tic), those six beautiful hours in the emergency room flicker in my head, and I am reminded how close I am to an alternate world in which I am happy, a world that occupies the same space as this one but is somehow distinct from it. And while that better world may be difficult to find, it is as close to me as the air in front of my face.

They didn’t say they craved attention but had trouble giving it to others. They didn’t say how cruel they could be.

Maybe he had seeds of doubt and realized what it takes a lot of other people years to figure out: that those seeds of doubt can spread tendrils through your body until they eventually strangle your heart.

There was only so much life to live, and no time to spend it with people who weren’t the very best fit.

This time our bonding was instantaneous and absolute, the kind shared between shipwreck survivors on a bobbing yellow life raft.

“These prickly little bastards is some tough hombres,” he explained. “Just like you and me. We may be in the desert right now, but I’m here to tell ya that we’ll get through this.”.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time:.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time: depressed that you identify with the sentiment, and hopeful because someone feels more miserable than you.

Would they still be happy and smiling in a year’s time, knowing as we did that to love is to risk great unhappiness?.

Personal setbacks and romantic rejection, according to authorities ranging from the Dalai Lama to the editors of CosmoGirl, offer us all opportunities to behave with grace and courage and self-respect.

I wanted her back so bad it gave me a stomachache.

“She’s dead to me,” I told my friends. “I was mentally ill to have dated her,” I told my friends. “Obviously a borderline personality,” I told my friends. “Why did I throw away the best thing I ever had?” I wrote in my journal. “Please, God, bring her back.”.

I lost ten pounds in two weeks.

For some reason I’ve always been susceptible to thinking my life would be vastly improved by the solution to a single problem.

“Ghosting is the most cowardly way to end a relationship,” I once said to a male friend in a room with a guy who had ghosted me years before.

“I feel so lucky right now,” he said. “I can’t believe a girl like you would give me the time of day.”.

“But I don’t want a guy to be nice to me just because he feels obligated to, you know? I want him to be nice because he means it.”.

Some guys say they know immediately She’s the One. Not me. Whether it’s a sweater or software, it takes some time for me to know if I want to keep something, one reason I always save receipts. I can’t say there was an instance when I looked into the pale blue eyes of the girl I met over corned beef hash at a café in San Francisco and thought, This is it.

Now, after eight years, I know. When did I know? Was it how she helped me deal with the death of my grandfather? The relief I felt when she finally answered her cell on September 11? That great hike in Point Reyes? Because she cried when the Sox finally won? The way my nephew greets her like a rock star when she walks into the room? Perhaps I should have known right from the start, that morning of our cross-country trip, when she required one last trip to Arthur Bryant’s for a half slab of ribs for breakfast (and ten minutes into the meal saying to me, “Hey, baby, why don’t you pop open a beer?”). Or did I not truly know until seven years later when we found ourselves forced apart for more than a year? Who can say? It’s the big moments, maybe, but it’s the little moments as much or even more.

We had nothing to do but love each other and be happy.

The finish line was drawing closer. Why not have one last blossoming of the heart?.

Sam, I knew I was happy.

We followed our hearts and gambled, and for a few years we had a bit of heaven on earth.

Maybe love was just what people claimed to feel for anyone who’d put up with them.

That’s probably the beginning of love: when you see someone in a way that defies reality, but which makes perfect sense to you.

Reflected in the slump of her shoulders. I knew about despair. I wore it like a familiar coat, incapable of accepting what must be tolerated and petulantly ignoring what must be acknowledged. But at that moment—at the sight of such sadness in one usually so open and upbeat, sadness in the spirit of a woman who needed something from me—I wanted to offer more than mumbled words of apology. But I also knew that to push myself deeper into her world might carry us to a place where I might lose what I had made of myself, a place where I knew I could no longer hold tight to the hard reality that kept me sane.

“Where can I find a man silly enough to stay home with my boys when they have chicken pox?” she replied, smiling and lifting up to kiss the top of my head. “I like it that you put me first.”.

I chose to love Belinda, chose against my head-logic and with my heart-dreams.

Where once her husband was the center of her passionate universe, there is now a new sun in whose orbit she revolves.

If the most erotic form of foreplay to a mother of a small child is, as I’ve heard some women claim, loading the dishwasher or sweeping the floor, then he’s a master of titillation.

And afterward my husband will say that we, he and I, are the core of what he cherishes, that the children are satellites, beloved but tangential. He seems entirely unperturbed by loving me like this. Loving me more than his children does not bother him.

I was thirty-three years old when we adopted DJ, and I thought I knew what a broken heart looked like, how it felt, but I didn’t know anything. You know what a broken heart looks like? Like a sobbing teenager handing over a two-day-old infant she can’t take care of to a couple who she hopes can.

A lot of people who self-destruct don’t think twice about destroying their children in the process.

# Logical Chess: Move By Move: Every Move Explained New Algebraic Edition (Irving Chernev) (Chernev, Irving)

Develop knights before bishops!.

One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap.

“The best attacking piece is the king’s bishop,” says Tarrasch, so White puts this piece to work and clears the way for early castling.

“You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.”.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.” This.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.”.

The act of leaving the back rank constitutes a developing move.

“Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.”.

“In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.”.

The knight possesses the peculiar property of being able to attack any other piece (except another knight) without being under attack in return.

In queen’s pawn openings, Black’s queen’s knight often does a better job at d7 than at c6.

But why give the king’s permanent address when White has revealed that he is preparing an assault on the kingside?.

“As Rousseau could not compose without his cat beside him, so I without my king’s bishop cannot play chess,”.

“In its absence the game to me is lifeless and cold. The vitalizing factor is missing, and I can devise no plan of attack.”.

The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings.

The pawn attacks the bishop that attacks the knight that defends the pawn that the knight attacks.

This is the point! The knight gives up his good position for a worthy cause. It is important, in order to capitalize on the weakness of the dark square f6, to remove the guardian of this square, the dark-squared bishop on e7.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don’t do this because they don’t have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common-sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one’s own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies.

Begin with 1 e4 or 1 d4, either of which moves releases two pieces.

Anchor at least one pawn in the centre and give it solid support. Pawns in the centre keep enemy pieces from settling themselves on the best squares.

There is danger, though, in attempting this before the king has castled.

Strategically, this represents a triumph for White. Not only does he remain with the advantage of the two bishops against Black’s knight and bishop, but he has also compelled Black’s remaining bishop to take up an unfavourable post, while White retains control of the long light-squared diagonal.

The point of playing 2 c4 so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king.

It took many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop’s development.

All moves must be made with respect to the threats of the opponent, not to arbitrary judgements which declare that certain moves are always ‘good’ or ‘bad’.

The c-pawn must be free to advance and attack White’s centre.

Why not win a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 xd5 instead? There would then follow 6... xd5! (the knight breaks the pin by brute force) 7 xd8 b4+ 8 d2 xd2+ 9 xd2 xd8 and Black has gained a piece.

Notice that White’s pawn at a3 prevents Black from regaining the pawn by 10... b4+, showing that White’s sixth move was not a waste of time.

Notice that he plays no combinations of any sort, either to win material or to start an attack on the king, until most of his pieces are brought off the back rank and into play. It.

Chess Analysed: or Instructions by Which a Perfect Knowledge of This Noble Game May in a Short Time Be Acquired: “A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.”.

“He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.”.

It is important to keep the pawn position in the centre fluid. It is important to maintain pressure on White’s d-pawn in the centre. It is important to retain the option of exchanging pawns in the centre.

Rooks must seize open files! What if there are none? Then bring your rooks toward the centre! They will then be at the head of files most likely to be opened. That is why the king’s rook is usually developed at e8 or d8, while the queen’s rook goes to d8 or c8.

“offers the maximum of security with the maximum of opportunity.”.

Whether objectively this is the strongest move is immaterial; the fact that the bishop’s pressure bothers Black is enough reason for Janowsky to maintain the pin!.

In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings.

In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings with only pawns on the board are the easiest to win.

“The hardest thing is to win a won game”.

Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it.


# Barely Functional Adult (Meichi Ng)

There’s only a small sliver of time to follow through on your fun, impractical notions before that pesky voice of reason reels you out of it—so you gotta act fast.

But instead of that license being proof of my competence as a driver, all it proves is that it’s much too easy to get a license.

I’ve never held any of the core competencies one would want of a driver—like the ability to focus—so as a courtesy to the world, I do not drive.

When we arrived at the pet store, my friend asked me why I wasn’t getting a dog or a cat. People always assume it’s one or the other when you declare your intention of acquiring a pet. It really throws off their worldview when your pet species goes beyond the fourth letter of the alphabet.

In fairness, I love both cats and dogs. But it was important for me to get a pet that didn’t have abandonment issues. I didn’t want a pet that would be sad whenever I left for work; I have enough guilt in my life as is. So instead, I focused my search on a pet companion that would love me—but at a comfortable distance. The kind of emotionally independent love that is there when you need it, but won’t swallow you whole. Try not to psychoanalyze that.

It’s easy to love things that are beautiful, but Bobo was far from beautiful. While the other fish in his tank had shimmering, buttercup-yellow scales that effortlessly glistened with every movement in the water, Bobo’s coat was more of a dull mustard color. Even as he anxiously darted from one corner of the tank to the other, his scales shimmered half-heartedly, as though they had long given up on the facade of beauty.

There is something to be said about the people who are able to give us the exact kind of junk we love.

Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.

Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.

It’s the kind of high you could spend your life chasing.

I spent the years that followed feeling silly that someone was able to make such a lasting impact on my life in such a short period of time, but I’ve since learned that time and impact are disturbingly uncorrelated when it comes to the people we love.

But grief presents itself as different monsters for different people.

People say things they don’t mean when they’re hurt,.

When our songs came on the radio, I would find Gum in my ears.

Trying to get over someone you can’t get over is like seeing a bridge and knowing full well that the only thing that separates you from eternal happiness is that one bridge.

My understanding of “moving on” has shifted substantially over the years. I no longer consider moving on to be synonymous with not caring. I think it’s more complex than that. I think moving on is about allowing ourselves to remember the good and the bad, to distinguish the past from the present, and to accept who we are, who we were, and everyone we met along the way.

I should have negotiated my salary, but my parents had always taught me to be thankful instead of asking for more.

The reasonable thing to do would have been to just accept it—to accept what most sensible adults have come to accept—that work is a pointless sacrifice to the gods in order to afford the basic necessities and niceties of life.

My tears are to be saved for sad movies—not sad managers,.

But I think there’s value in knowing when to call it, in knowing when to get up and leave, in knowing when we’re done—even if it means having to walk out into the unknown to start all over again.

“Sometimes I feel like . . . nothing I do is ever good enough or will ever be good enough,” I said, opening yet another jar. “What makes you think that?” my therapist asked. “Well, I look back at something I made three years ago and I feel like it’s total garbage. Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .”.

Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .” I paused briefly here before resuming in a low and conspiratorial whisper, “what if . . . everything I do is always and forever going to be garbage?” I gave my therapist a piercing look, as if daring her to find fallacy in my airtight argument. My therapist simply returned a knowing smile. “And what would it mean to you if everything you do is garbage?” she asked. “Well it would mean that I’m gar . . .” I stopped short of finishing that sentence, but we both knew what I was about to say. I turned away to look out one of the windows before continuing. “I guess . . . one day, I’d just like to look at something I made and be proud of it . . . is all,” I said, hoping to end on a lighter note. My therapist gave me a sympathetic smile and a meaningful look. I hated how it actually made me feel a tiny bit better.

The sky can keep its lousy wishes, I thought. Surely, a shooting star wasn’t that much better than a regular star, and there were plenty of regular stars out there. I decided right then and there that if patience was a virtue, then it would have to be a virtue I lived without.

The kind of mutual best friendships that never needed further validation.

And who knows how many times you’re allowed to say no before you stop getting invited altogether.

I guess I always held this suspicion that people put on different versions of themselves in a group setting. And until you’ve talked to someone one-on-one, you don’t really know what they’re like under that mask. And.

And sure, enjoying the company of just one friend at a time may be more time-consuming, but isn’t it nice to know someone cares enough about you to spend time with just you? And not only when it’s a bundled deal with other people?.

But then again, I had friends back home. I guess when you take something for granted and it’s suddenly lost—you tend to feel a bit lost in return.

Don’t think anyone really needs friends, but maybe they’re just nice to have.

I wanted friends who could co-own bookstore speakeasies with me—the kind of friends you get from decades of friendship. I wanted this kind of deep, meaningful friendship and I wanted it in ten seconds flat.

When I packed my bags to move to another country, I forgot to pack my friends. I guess I just thought they were something I could easily pick up after I had settled in . . . like laundry detergent or potted plants.

Pretending to be extroverted when you’re introverted is about as fun as shoving your face into a dirty bucket of ice.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself. Pointless conversations can go on for hours, but you won’t feel the hours. And if you should say something questionable, they’ll know it’s because you’re having a bad week, and not because you’re a bad person. True friends see the best parts of us, even when we forget those parts ourselves.

If you say something questionable, you become questionable as a person.

True friends know how many siblings you have—that kind of thing is just basic friendship knowledge.

I began to wonder if I would ever come across that friend click again. The kind of friendship where we could share custody of a pet alpaca. And sure, we wouldn’t be able to go on vacation at the same time because someone would (obviously) have to stay and take care of the alpaca, but that’s a sacrifice I’d be willing to make.

I began to remember who I was when I didn’t have to be someone else for other people, and in this version of myself, I met friends who I actually connected with—the kind of friendships that clicked.

Only after I built my perfect home did I realize that I longed for stars not roof on my head. But I guess it was fine, somethings only get inside your head once you have a roof on your head..

In time,.

“Wishing Tree, here I come,” I whispered to myself. It was completely unnecessary to whisper, but that just made it all the more necessary.

Well, technically, they were raising me up, but I was a reluctant passenger on this spaceship to monotony.

Sure, it does take me a lot longer to recover from a night out, and I did find an unverified wrinkle the other day, but I didn’t know that it meant that I was old, I just assumed it meant I was not young.

Trees are majestic beings—nature’s historians who silently safeguard the riddles of our universe.

I guess when you really want something, it’s just easier to assume you won’t get it.

Not getting something you really want is disheartening enough without also having to be consoled by others.

I enlisted the best free labor I had access to—my family.

I don’t fully understand the magic or logic behind it, but sometimes a stranger, with no sense of boundaries, asking you deeply personal questions is exactly what you need to hear in order to rethink your life.

I think we’re allowed to just . . . do whatever it is that we want to do. Whatever it is that makes us happy.

And in trying to figure out what we want to do, in trying to figure out what makes us happy, we’re bound to feel a little lost at times. But maybe this sense of feeling lost is necessary. Maybe feeling lost is what pushes us to keep exploring. It’s the ethereal song that awakens our curiosities and drives us to follow cows, discover hidden coves, and find remnants of good in a world that so often feels too dark and broken.

Maybe feeling lost is just the prerequisite of adventure—the first chapter of any good story.

A portrait-painter, he called himself, but he hadn't painted any portraits. He was sitting on the side-lines with a blanket over his shoulders, waiting for a chance to get into the game.

Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I'm a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn't. I forgot them.

Have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married and then been introduced to her husband? If so you'll understand how I felt when Clarence burst on me. You know the feeling. First of all, when you hear about the marriage, you say to yourself, “I wonder what he's like.” Then you meet him, and think, “There must be some mistake. She can't have preferred this to me!” That's what I thought, when I set eyes on Clarence.

He had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point. About once a month he would take three days writing a few poems; the other three hundred and twenty-nine days of the year he rested.

The corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch, and for a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fish's.

You know, I rather think I agree with those poet-and-philosopher Johnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if he has a bit of trouble. All that stuff about being refined by suffering, you know. Suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and more sympathetic outlook. It helps you to understand other people's misfortunes if you've been through the same thing yourself.

I've often heard that chappies, after some great shock or loss, have a habit, after they've been on the floor for a while wondering what hit them, of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together, and sort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life. Time, the great healer, and Nature, adjusting itself, and so on and so forth. There's a lot in it. I know, because in my own case, after a day or two of what you might call prostration, I began to recover. The frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery, but at least I found that I was able to have a dash at enjoying life again. What I mean is, I braced up to the extent of going round the cabarets once more, so as to try to forget, if only for the moment.

He told me once that he could sit on a fence, watching a worm and wondering what on earth it was up to, for hours at a stretch.


# The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess (Patrick Wolff)

To begin a game, the board must be placed so that the right-hand corner square nearest each player is white. Throughout this book, we will refer to pictures of the board, called “Diagrams,” that look like Diagram 1. Notice that the bottom right-hand corner in this and every Diagram is white!.

A file is a row of eight squares going from top to bottom. A rank is a row of eight squares going from left to right. Notice that a chessboard has eight files and eight ranks.

“The pawn is the soul of chess,”.

Each side gets only one queen.

Sometimes people get confused about whether the white queen starts on d1 or e1, and whether the black queen starts on d8 or e8. It is easy to remember if you keep in mind that chess was played when chivalry was still very much alive, so as a sign of respect to the queen it always starts the game on the same color square as she.

If you have a computer you can play chess with, here’s a good way to practice reading and writing chess moves: Play a game against the computer, and have it list the moves of the game. While you are playing, you should write down both your moves and its moves without looking at the computer’s list of the moves. When the game is finished, compare your record of the moves with the computer’s.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture it. In Diagrams 1 and 2, by moving two squares forward the white pawn was able to pass by the d3 square, which the black pawn controls, and get to safety on d4. In doing so, it “passed by” the opposing pawn’s control of the square in front of it. The en passant rule gives the opposing pawn one chance to capture the pawn as if it had moved only one square; that is, to capture it as it passes by the square it controls. But the opposing pawn only gets one chance! If it doesn’t capture the pawn on the very next move, then the en passant capture is no longer possible.

What’s the complaint?.

Chess is a really interesting game. All pieces can move forward or backward, other than pawns who can pawns. But that's not the reason why chess is interesting. All pieces remain themselves, or they die as the game proceed. A queen starts as a queen and ends as a queen, alive or dead. A bishop starts as a bishop and ends as a bishop, alive or dead. But a pawn, a pawn if alive, has the potential to became a knight, or bishop, or rook, or even a queen. A pwan can be whatever it wishes to be on reaching the end of line. You know why? Because a pawn will sacrifice itself, but will not move backwards.

The tunnel does have light at the end of it, even if we aren’t able to see it. And there’s a two-for-one offer on clouds and silver linings. Words, just sometimes, can set you free.

That said, if books had to replicate our exact experience of the world to be useful, the only books worth reading would be written by ourselves.

Misery, like yoga, is not a competitive sport. But I have found over the years that by reading about other people who have suffered, survived and overcome despair I have felt comforted. It has given me hope. I hope this book can do the same.

‘But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.’ —Albert Camus, A Happy Death.

The weirdest thing about a mind is that you can have the most intense things going on in there but no one else can see them.

That old classic wish. To never have been born.

(The poet Melissa Broder once tweeted: ‘what idiot called it “depression” and not “there are bats living in my chest and they take up a lot of room, ps. I see a shadow”?’).

It can affect people – millionaires, people with good hair, happily married people, people who have just landed a promotion, people who can tap dance and do card tricks and strum a guitar, people who have no noticeable pores, people who exude happiness in their status updates – who seem, from the outside, to have no reason to be miserable.

The idea that madness should be allowed to be madness.

The idea that madness should be allowed to be madness. That a fearful, repressive society brands anyone different as ill.

I think life always provides reasons to not die, if we listen hard enough.

It underlines the idea we have hammered into us by the hundred thousand TV ads we have seen that everything can be fixed by consuming things. It.

It underlines the idea we have hammered into us by the hundred thousand TV ads we have seen that everything can be fixed by consuming things.

One lesson learned from treating chronic pain is that it is tough to override responses that are hardwired into the body and mind.

For instance, if you live in Greenland you are twenty-seven times more likely to kill yourself than if you live in Greece.

I felt like an outsider, with my left-wing, middle-class parents in a right-wing, working-class town.

‘ . . . once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.’ —Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore.

‘Incipient insanity was mainly a matter of chemicals,’.

Exercise definitely helps me, as does yoga and absorbing myself in something or someone I love, so I keep doing these things. I suppose, in the absence of universal certainties, we are our own best laboratory.

‘Monsters are real,’ Stephen King said. ‘And ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.’.

The way people seem to cope is by not thinking about it too much.

LIFE IS HARD. It may be beautiful and wonderful but it is also hard. The way people seem to cope is by not thinking about it too much. But some people are not going to be able to do that. And besides, it is the human condition. We think therefore we are. We know we are going to grow old, get ill and die. We know that is going to happen to everyone we know, everyone we love. But also, we have to remember, the only reason we have love in the first place is because of this. Humans might well be the only species to feel depression as we do, but that is simply because we are a remarkable species, one that has created remarkable things – civilisation, language, stories, love songs. Chiaroscuro means a contrast of light and shade. In Renaissance paintings of Jesus, for instance, dark shadow was used to accentuate the light bathing Christ. It is a hard thing to accept, that death and decay and everything bad leads to everything good, but I for one believe it. As Emily Dickinson, eternally great poet and occasionally anxious agoraphobe, said: ‘That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet.’.

WHEN I WAS most severely depressed I had quite a vast collection of related mental illnesses. We humans love to compartmentalise things. We love to divide our education system into separate subjects, just as we love to divide our shared planet into nations, and our books into separate genres. But the reality is that things are blurred. Just as being good at mathematics often means someone is good at physics, so having depression means it probably comes with other things.

Minds have their own weather systems. You are in a hurricane. Hurricanes run out of energy eventually. Hold on.

Pain is a debt paid off with time.

‘Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile. Which is to say, don’t kill yourself. Even when the darkness is total. Always know that life is not still. Time is space. You are moving through that galaxy. Wait for the stars.’.

You will one day experience joy that matches this pain. You will cry euphoric tears at the Beach Boys, you will stare down at a baby’s face as she lies asleep in your lap, you will make great friends, you will eat delicious foods you haven’t tried yet, you will be able to look at a view from a high place and not assess the likelihood of dying from falling. There are books you haven’t read yet that will enrich you, films you will watch while eating extra-large buckets of popcorn, and you will dance and laugh and have sex and go for runs by the river and have late-night conversations and laugh until it hurts. Life is waiting for you. You might be stuck here for a while, but the world isn’t going anywhere. Hang on in there if you can. Life is always worth it.

At university our friends always considered us to be a happy couple. And we were, except for the other half of the time when we were an unhappy couple.

This was a kind of kindness. She never could cope if someone felt awkward, and so always bent to meet them as much as she could. I think – if I offered her anything – it was the chance to be herself.

The best gift we can offer our friends is a chance to be themselves.

‘we forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people’,.

‘we forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people’, then love – at its best – is a way to reclaim those lost parts of ourselves. That freedom we lost somewhere quite early in childhood. Maybe love is just about finding the person you can be your weird self with.

I helped her be her, and she helped me be me. We did this through talking. In our first year together we would very often stay up all night talking. The night would start with us going to the wine shop at the bottom of Sharp Street in Hull (the street my student house was on) and buying a bottle of wine we couldn’t afford, and would very often end with us watching breakfast TV on my old Hitachi, which required constant manoeuvring of the aerial to see the picture.

But the arguments were surface stuff. If you go deep enough under a tidal wave the water is still. That is what we were like. In a way we argued because we knew it would have no fundamental impact. When you can be yourself around someone, you project your dissatisfied self outwards. And in Ibiza, I was that. I was not happy. And part of my personality was this: when I was unhappy, I tried to drown.

She encouraged me to read, to write. She earned us money. She gave us time. She handled all the organisational side of my life, the stuff you need to do to tick over.

She filled in the blanks that worry and darkness had left in its wake. She was my mind-double. My life-sitter. My literal other half when half of me had gone. She covered for me, waiting patiently like a war wife, during my absence from myself.

There are seven billion versions of normal on this planet.

But so, increasingly, were books. I read and read and read with an intensity I’d never really known before. I mean, I’d always considered myself to be a person who liked books. But there is a difference between liking books and needing them. I needed books. They weren’t a luxury good during that time in my life. They were a Class A addictive substance. I’d have gladly got into serious debt to read (indeed, I did). I think I read more books in those six months than I had done during five years of university education, and I’d certainly fallen deeper into the worlds conjured on the page. There is this idea that you either read to escape or you read to find yourself. I don’t really see the difference.

There is this idea that you either read to escape or you read to find yourself. I don’t really see the difference. We find ourselves through the process of escaping. It is not where we are, but where we want to go, and all that. ‘Is there no way out of the mind?’ Sylvia Path famously asked. I had been interested in this question (what it meant, what the answers might be) ever since I had come across it as a teenager in a book of quotations. If there is a way out, a way that isn’t death itself, then the exit route is through words. But rather than leave the mind entirely, words help us leave a mind, and give us the building blocks to build another one, similar but better, nearby to the old one but with firmer foundations, and very often a better view.

‘The object of art is to give life a shape,’ said Shakespeare. And my life – and my mess of a mind – needed shape. I had ‘lost the plot’. There was no linear narrative of me. There was just mess and chaos. So yes, I loved external narratives for the hope they offered.

They were, in and of themselves, reasons to stay alive.

Every book written is the product of a human mind in a particular state. Add all the books together and you get the end sum of humanity.

Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself. But each map was incomplete, and I would only locate the treasure if I read all the books, and so the process of finding my best self was an endless quest. And books themselves seemed to me to reflect this idea. Which is why the plot of every book ever can be boiled down to ‘someone is looking for something’.

‘Hate is a lack of imagination,’ we are told.

‘There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in.’.

Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino – The most beautiful book. Imaginary cities, each kind of like Venice but not at all like Venice. Dreams on a page. So unreal they could almost dislodge my strange mind-visions.

The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton – The book that got me properly into reading as a ten-year-old. Has always been my favourite ‘escape’ read. It drips with America and has gorgeously sentimental dialogue. (Like: ‘Stay gold, Ponyboy’, said by Johnny, on his death bed, after reading Robert Frost’s ‘Nothing Gold Can Stay’.).

The Concise Collins Dictionary of Quotations – Quotations are easy to read.

Letters of Keats – I had studied Keats at university. The archetypal young poet was thin-skinned and doomed and intense, and I felt these things.

Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Jeanette Winterson – I loved Jeanette’s writing. Every word contained strength or wisdom. I picked it up at random pages to see sentences that could speak to me. ‘I seem to have run in a great circle, and met myself again on the starting line.’.

Vox, Nicholson Baker – A novel that consists entirely of an episode of phone sex, that had titillated and enthralled me when I was sixteen. Pure dialogue. Again, easy to read, and full of sex, or the idea of sex, and for a young, anxiety-riddled mind, thinking of sex can be a positive distraction.

The Catcher in the Rye, J.D. Salinger – Because Holden was an old friend.

The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry – Poems like Ivor Gurney’s ‘Strange Hells’ (‘The heart burns – but has to keep out of face how heart burns’) and Wilfred Owen’s ‘Mental Cases’ (describing the shell-shocked patients of a mental hospital) fascinated me but troubled me. I had been through no war and yet I related to that feeling of pain contained in every new day, as ‘Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh’. It fascinated me how depression and anxiety overlap with post-traumatic stress disorder. Had we been through some trauma we didn’t know about? Was the noise and speed of modern life the trauma for our caveman brains? Was I that soft? Or was life a kind of war most people didn’t see? A.

A History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters, Julian Barnes – Just because it was a book I had read and loved before and which was funny and strange and I knew it inside out.

Wilderness Tips, Margaret Atwood – Short stories. Smaller hills to climb. A story called ‘True Trash’ was my favourite. About teenage boys perving at waitresses.

The best way to beat a monster is to find a scarier one.

‘Travel makes one modest,’ said Gustave Flaubert. ‘You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.’ Such perspective can be strangely liberating. Especially when you have an illness that may on the one hand lower self-esteem, but on the other intensifies the trivial.

‘There’s too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes.’.

‘The wound is the place where the light enters you.’.

‘Forget safety. Live where you fear to live.’).

Like Haruki Murakami – whose excellent book What I Talk About When I Talk About Running I would later read – I found running to be a way of clearing the fog.

To go on a run every day is to have a kind of battle with yourself.

Weapons for the war that subsides but that can always ignite again. And so writing, reading, talking, travelling, yoga, meditation and running were some of mine.

It is like the distance between a writer and their fictional, semi-autobiographical narrator.

And what does this teach us? That depression can happen to prime ministers and presidents and cricketers and playwrights and boxers and the stars of hit Hollywood comedies.

While we know it can happen to anyone, we can never be told too many times that it can actually happen to anyone.

She told the interviewer that the only thing that stopped her was the thought of her mother finding her.

Actually, depression can be exacerbated by things being all right externally, because the gulf between what you are feeling and what you are expected to feel becomes larger.

Actually, depression can be exacerbated by things being all right externally, because the gulf between what you are feeling and what you are expected to feel becomes larger. If you feel the same amount of depression as someone would naturally feel in a prisoner of war camp, but you are not in a prisoner of war camp, and are instead in a nice semi-detached house in the free world, then you think ‘Crap, this is everything I ever wanted, why aren’t I happy?’.

As any Buddhist would tell you, an over-attachment to material things will lead only to more suffering.

It is said that insanity is a logical response to an insane world. Maybe depression is in part simply a response to a life we don’t really understand. Of course, no one understands their life completely if they think about it. An annoying thing about depression is that thinking about life is inevitable. Depression makes thinkers out of all of us. Just ask Abraham Lincoln.

The political philosopher John Gray – one of my favourite non-fiction writers (read Straw Dogs to see why).

The political philosopher John Gray – one of my favourite non-fiction writers (read Straw Dogs to see why) – believes Churchill didn’t ‘overcome’ depression to become a good war leader, rather that the experience of depression directly enabled him to be one.

A lot of Freud’s work was based on his analysis of his own depression, and what he believed to be the solution. Cocaine was what worked for him, but then – after dishing it out to other sufferers – he started to realise it could be a tad addictive.

Kafka’s most famous story is The Metamorphosis. A travelling salesman wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect, who has overslept and is late for work. It is a story about the dehumanising effect of capitalism, yes, but it can equally be read as a metaphor for depression, the most Kafkaesque of illnesses. For, like Gregor Samsa, the depressive can sometimes wake up in the room they fell asleep in, and yet feel totally different. An alien to themselves. Trapped in a nightmare.

Fear makes us curious. Sadness makes us philosophise. (‘To be or not to be?’ is a daily question for many depressives.).

Lincoln didn’t do great work because he solved the problem of his melancholy; the problem of his melancholy was all the more fuel for the fire of his great work.’.

For instance, I find that being grimly aware of mortality can make me steadfastly determined to enjoy life where life can be enjoyed.

There can be infinity inside a day.

To panic without a reason, that’s madness. To panic with a reason, that’s sanity.

‘If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment. Live in the breath.’.

Anaïs Nin called anxiety ‘love’s greatest killer’. But fortunately, the reverse is also true. Love is anxiety’s greatest killer. Love is an outward force. It is our road out of our own terrors, because anxiety is an illness that wraps us up in our own nightmares. This is not selfishness, even though people read it as such. If your leg is on fire, it is not selfish to concentrate on the pain, or the fear of the flames. So it is with anxiety. People with mental illnesses aren’t wrapped up in themselves because they are intrinsically any more selfish than other people. Of course not. They are just feeling things that can’t be ignored. Things that point the arrows inward. But having people who love you and who you love is such a help. This doesn’t have to be romantic, or even familial love. Forcing yourself to see the world through love’s gaze can be healthy. Love is an attitude to life. It can save us.

I still haven’t seen Iceland where my ashes will be scattered.

He’s my lighthouse in the storm.

Reading Emily Dickinson poems.

Reading Keats’ letters.

‘We blow out a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although with the perfect certainty that it will burst.’.

We cannot save ourselves from suffering by buying an iPhone. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy one, it just means we should know such things are not ends in themselves.

The idea that kindness makes us happier than selfishness.

To be selfless, while being mindful, seems to be a good solution, when the self intensifies and causes us to suffer.

How to stop time: kiss. How to travel in time: read. How to escape time: music. How to feel time: write. How to release time: breathe.

There is absolutely nothing in the past that you can change. That’s basic physics.

Kurt Vonnegut was right. ‘Reading and writing are the most nourishing forms of meditation anyone has so far found.’.

Don’t feel guilty about being idle. More harm is probably done to the world through work than idleness. But perfect your idleness. Make it mindful.

Wherever you are, at any moment, try and find something beautiful. A face, a line out of a poem, the clouds out of a window, some graffiti, a wind farm. Beauty cleans the mind.

Hate is a pointless emotion to have inside you. It is like eating a scorpion to punish it for stinging you.

Shower before noon.

Look at the sky. Remind yourself of the cosmos. Seek vastness at every opportunity, in order to see the smallness of yourself.

Read a book without thinking about finishing it. Just read it. Enjoy every word, sentence, and paragraph. Don’t wish for it to end, or for it to never end.

Three in the morning is never the time to try and sort out your life.

Read Emily Dickinson. Read Graham Greene. Read Italo Calvino. Read Maya Angelou. Read anything you want. Just read. Books are possibilities. They are escape routes. They give you options when you have none. Each one can be a home for an uprooted mind.

Remember that the key thing about life on earth is change. Cars rust. Paper yellows. Technology dates. Caterpillars become butterflies. Nights morph into days. Depression lifts.

Reading The Tiger Who Came to Tea, and doing the tiger’s voice.

Cities twinkling at night as you drive past them, as if they are fallen constellations of stars.

“When does a war end?” he asks her of her memories of Vietnam. “When can I say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?”.


# The Fitness Mindset: Eat for energy, Train for tension, Manage your mindset, Reap the results (Keane, brian)

‘People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel’.

1g of carbohydrates has 4 calories 1g of protein has 4 calories 1g of fat has 9 calories Various foods are a compilation of these three building blocks. Therefore, if you know how many carbohydrates, fats and proteins are present in any given food item, you can calculate how many calories or how much energy that food contains. Below is an example of the formula for calculating the number of calories in a food.

Further in this chapter, I will discuss how making one simple change – eliminating or greatly reducing processed foods – can have an incredibly beneficial impact on your body’s ability to burn body fat or build lean muscle.

Combining legumes with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds or nuts such as walnuts, almonds or cashew provides complete proteins. One of my personal favourites is a trail mix of nuts, cashews, sunflower seeds with hummus or guacamole dip and raw vegetables.

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that keeps your nerves and blood cells healthy.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen. Personally, I use vitamin B12 spray every single day for the regulation of my nervous system, which can also reduce stress, worry and anxiety. However, there are numerous other benefits to adding B12 to your supplement regimen if you are not consuming it from food.

Long-term deficiency puts you at a risk of nerve degeneration, mental disturbance and depression amongst a host of other problems.

Once these symptoms manifest, it’s nearly impossible to fully recover. The take-home message is to make sure that you get enough vitamin B12 from your meat or consider adding it to your supplement regimen. Personally, I only eat red meat once or twice a week, so I hedge my bets and supplement with.

‘The first recorded heart attack was in 1912 and by 1930 the number of heart attacks had reached 3,000 and by 1960, there were over 500,000 deaths recorded from heart attacks.’.

Modern breakfast cereals and cereal bars for example are so highly processed, high in sugar and devoid of absorbable nutrients that they leave you fighting a losing blood sugar battle for the rest of the day. The answer is to eat more fat.

Vegans who eat more seeds tend to have much higher levels of omega 3 as well.

Omega 3 is actively involved in critical biological functions such as improving cognitive abilities, helping you retain information better, helping you perform complicated tasks more effectively, alleviating pain and inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity.

Nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews).

Seeds (pumpkin, linseed, chia).

Keeping your energy and blood sugar levels stable and in balance can allow you to train harder without getting food cravings associated with blood sugar drops, which can come from missing meals and snacks. This can give you a significantly better quality of life by increasing your overall energy levels, as a result helping you lose body fat and/or building lean muscle in the process.

This means that if you consume 200mg of caffeine at 12 midday, 100mg will still be in your system at 5pm.

‘unless people get to bed by 10:30pm and get a full eight hours of sleep, they’re wasting their money’.

Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

Too much protein can raise the alertness chemical in the brain called orexin, which can disrupt your sleep. Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

The Honey Prescription, a small amount of raw honey has a similar effect on relaxing your body before bed. Furthermore, combining honey with some MCT oil will not throw you out of the fat-burning mode, as the shortest-length MCT derived from a supplement produces ketones even in the presence of carbohydrates.

GABA is great at bed time, but can also be used during the day if you’re highly stressed or dealing with anxiety.

Also sold as 5HTP, L-tryptophan is normally talked about after Christmas or thanksgiving dinner, as turkey is particularly high in this amino acid. L-tryptophan can allow your brain to release serotonin (one of our brains happy hormones), which can help you unwind before bed.

A 2% drop in body water can cause a small yet critical shrinkage of the brain, which can impair coordination and massively decrease concentration. Dehydration can also reduce endurance, decrease strength, cause cramping and slow-down muscular response.

There are numerous different training systems and styles that can work great for people, but I’ve found that in order to build a leaner, more muscular or toned physique, there’s one thing that you need to do above all else – tear muscle fibres by creating tension on the muscle.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout. In order for your muscles to repair, your metabolism has to increase, lending itself to burning more calories while you rest.

Tension-style training means keeping the muscle you are working under optimal tension throughout the duration of the movement, i.e. two seconds on the way down, 1 second hold at the bottom or top and two seconds on the way up (2:1:2).

The take-home message is that it’s not about moving the weight from A to B – the aim is to create optimal tension for the duration of the movement and actually ‘feel’ the muscle you are working as a mind–muscle connection.

The best piece of gym advice that I have received was ‘Leave your ego at the door’.

Form: it’s not about the weight, it’s about how you move the weight.

Both systems work incredibly well and can be used interchangeably. My advice would be to use a rest pause on busier gym days, so that you don’t lose your bench or need extra sets of dumbbells and use drop sets when training at home or on quieter gym days.

Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

Aerobic activity by its very nature requires fat to be used as a primary fuel source, with carbohydrates and protein being used to a smaller extent. Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

There is no ‘one best cardio’ or aerobic activity. The key is to find the one you enjoy the most, which your body responds to, normally by reducing body fat and then using that as your primary source of cardio. If you hate to run, try swimming or cycling. If you love team sports, join a sports club and get your cardio that way.

Note: 70% of your max heart rate is your ‘fat-burning zone’ – to calculate your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are 28, it would be 220 minus 28, which is 192.

137-138 heart rate.

LISS is a good tool if your diet is clean – your carbs are low and you’re eating regular meals throughout the day alongside your weight-training program. But I’ve found that you do need to do longer spells of LISS, normally 15–20 minutes or more to see any noticeable changes.

HIIT on the other hand is ‘sprint training’. Its benefits are that it’s quick (five to ten minutes normally), burns through more glycogen (stored carbohydrates) and gives you a great feeling of accomplishment upon finish. Its negatives are that it’s difficult. And when done correctly, very difficult!.

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.).

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.). The key is to go as hard as possible for 30 seconds and then completely rest or recover for the next 30 seconds.

Depleting your glycogen levels by doing your weight training first and your cardio after could potentially allow you to tap into fat stores more effectively. Of course, as long as you are doing your cardio or getting your heart rate up alongside all the other tips mentioned in this book, you will burn body fat. This is just a quick tip that could potentially allow you to do it faster.

For 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout. Her pre-workout meal was chicken or fish, mixed vegetables and one tablespoon of almond butter or 150g of sweet potato. As she is focused on tension during her weight training, she is burning through all the glucose in her body at a pretty rapid rate – she’s not even half way through her workout, and is now very likely to be tapping into her stored carbohydrates (glycogen). Twenty minutes later, her glycogen is nearly completely depleted and she is now using fat as her primary fuel source. She finishes her workout with 10 minutes of HIIT. Two months later, Jane is leaner, fitter, slimmer, more toned, feels better and continues to train for the rest of the year.

Jane Smith trains four days every week for 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout.

Remember, progress is addictive: I don’t know a person in the world who could continue a workout regime with absolutely no progress. So arm yourself with knowledge and get better results in less time.

‘Push, pull, legs’ is the name of the training split for the movement patterns of that specific muscle group. ‘Push’ refers to all the movements where you use muscles that push the weight away from your body as their primary movement pattern – chest, shoulders and triceps. In ‘pull’, all the exercise is geared at pulling the weight toward your body as the muscles’ primary movement patterns – back, rear delts and biceps. ‘Legs’ refers to lower body-focused leg training.

If you use training as your ‘de-stress’ from work, then evening may be best for you.

Make training a priority, but try to fit it around your lifestyle and not the other way around.

Sets: The number of sets is the number of ‘rounds’ you do. For example, if you do 3 sets of 10 reps, you perform 10 reps of the exercise with a 2:1:2 tempo and then rest for 60 seconds. Repeat for your second and third set.

All the cardio in this program is based on HIIT. HIIT burns more calories, takes less time and works incredibly well to elevate metabolism while burning fat when incorporated into a tension styled program. I personally like using the rowing machine or a stationary bike, but HIIT can be done on any cardio machine.

For HIIT training, set a level that you can sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, reduce the level to a very easy pace and recover for these seconds. Repeat this process 10 times for a total of 10 minutes.

Each workout should take between 40–60 minutes. This program is about quality over quantity. Therefore, bring a stopwatch to time your rest periods, train intensely while in the gym and get out within 60 minutes, so that you don’t start to burn through any hard-earned muscle or overstress your central nervous system.

The entire training program is present below, but if you go to www.briankeanefitness.com you can download the videos that wgo through the entire workout and on how to perform each move correctly.

‘Don’t let your own worst enemy live between your two ears.’.

The first audio book I ever listened to was The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, which changed the way I looked at everything I did in my life.

Charles Duhigg talks about the ‘routine – cue – reward’ system of habits. In order to change a habit, you need to change one of the components of this system. The routine is the actual situation or ‘trigger’ – for me, the routine was coming home every day after work. The cue is what you do next, i.e. getting two or three bars from the cupboard and sitting in the same seat watching the same show. And the reward is serotonin release, the ‘happy hormone’ your brain releases from the chocolate.

For me, the routine of coming home from work was always going to be the same, so I changed the cue. Instead of reaching for chocolate bars in the cupboard, I left a pre-packed gym bag beside the front door. I would come home (routine), pick up my gym bag (new cue) and the reward came via the serotonin release from exercise.

I tried and lived my life by internalizing that there are only three ways to look at most of the things in your life: 1) the things you know; 2) the things you don’t know; and 3) the things you don’t know you don’t know.

I used and still use books, podcasts and following the right people on social media to bridge the gap between all three.

Son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

‘My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

There’s a great story in Darren Hardy’s The Compound Effect about a man riding a horse, galloping fast. It appears that’s he’s going somewhere very important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, ‘Where are you going?’ The rider replies, ‘I don’t know. Ask the horse!’.

Psychological studies reveal that 95% of everything we feel, think, do and achieve is a result of a learned habit.

All of the ‘hows’ mean nothing until you find your ‘why’.

I have what I call a ‘non job’ where my life and my job are one and the same.

We all experience emotions like frustration, anger or being overwhelmed and develop a strategy to end these feelings. Some people use food, some use sex, drugs or alcohol. Others use running, going to the gym or reading.

Her journey is her journey, and I have no control over it, but I have control over how much I am present in this journey and how much influence, advice and guidance I can provide to help develop her character along the way.

It might be a comment or a jibe from a friend or a loved one that gives you that spark to get into great shape or a friend who called you stupid that led you to read more books (my why for indulging in reading).

Thus, on days when you’re struggling and want to give up, recall the pain that made you get started and remember your why.

Stress is the figurative ‘death by a thousand cuts’ – you can get everything right with your nutrition, training and supplementation, but if you are in a constant state of fight or flight, stress or anxiety, you are going to struggle to hit your own natural potential.

‘I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most which never happened’.

How about those times when you felt just ‘off’ for no reason other than not feeling right – you just felt on edge, but everything in your life was perfectly fine. This affected me for years until I better understood how certain food ingredients, (additives, flavourings etc.) of certain processed foods had a direct impact on my mood and anxiety levels. If you want to know more about this, take a look at the nutrition section of the book if you’ve not done so yet.

Have you ever wondered why your dog gets happy every single time they see you? Dogs and other animals haven’t developed the part of the brain that allows them to picture the future, so when they see you, they are completely present every single time. They’re not worried about when you will go again, whether they will get food that day or any other scenario that may or may not happen.

Although developing our pre-frontal cortex has allowed us to build civilisations and create things beyond our wildest dreams, the trade off is we can sometimes lack ‘being present’ – or being in the actual moment because we are thinking about the future. Nine out of ten times, it’s normally worrying about something that hasn’t even happened yet – work the next day, paying our bills, etc. This is normally the foundation of anxiety.

‘Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but you never get anywhere’.

Your brain is like a Rottweiler guard dog – if you mind it, care for it and look after it, it will serve you for life, but if you mistreat it or don’t look after it, it can attack you, harm you and even kill you.

Deep down, most of us want to be accepted and liked by our peers and build positive and thriving relationships with people.

‘Become the person you want to be and then wait for reality to catch up with that version of you’.

My biggest goal in life is to leave the world better than how I had found it, and to instil my life’s philosophy into my daughter so that if she chooses to stand on the shoulders of giants, she has the character and a belief in herself to do it. I want the world to be better because we were here.

Sometimes, we determine our character by what we have or do, and that allows us to become that person. For example, if I have a nice car or a big house, then I will be successful, or if I do well in this show, test or exam, I can become successful. In my opinion, the sequence of actions in that model is wrong. It’s the ‘do, have and be’ model. If I do or have this, I can be that.

As I sat in the car feeling horribly sorry for myself, I looked into my audio book library and re-listened to one of my favourites: Mastery by Robert Greene.

The biggest difference in my life over the last two years, alongside the birth of my daughter, is my ability to take control of my wandering and unhelpful thoughts. Two years ago, if I were left to my own devices, my mind would wander off to the social interaction conversations I had that day, and my life never really changed. I had the same income, the same shape of mind and body, the same network of people I hung around with – nothing ever really progressed.

I know that philosophy helps strengthen my mindset, so I read Seneca or Marcus Aurelius before bed.

I think conflict avoidance is one the biggest detriments to happiness and has been the biggest factor in my own life for dealing with chronic worry. I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head.

I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head. I avoided the conversation or the situation because I wanted to avoid the feeling of unease that I knew would inevitably come from it.

Would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself.

I would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself to justify the situation: ‘Oh I don’t want to hurt this person’s feelings’ or ‘It’s probably not true anyway’, etc. There were times when I just didn’t want to admit that I was too much of a coward to take ownership of a situation.

Now, I like to think of tough words as workouts – all the growth and results come from leaning into the pain of the workout. If you are too comfortable when you work out, your body never really changes. You need to go outside of your comfort zone.

I always try to follow the 10% law: your goals and targets should be so high that even if you only hit 10% of it, you would have still achieved more than 99.9% of what you ever dreamed possible.

In every aspect of your life, it’s your choice whether you want to put ‘I’ in front of something (I am angry with those comments, I am annoyed someone would say that, I am disappointed that person used those words). These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself.

These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself. The criticism is not you and you are not the criticism.

Through the readings of Seneca and other stoic philosophers, I can now see from the perspective that sometimes, the criticism or negativity aimed in our direction is actually the other person’s way of consciously or subconsciously dealing with their own demons.

‘Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not the truth’.

When you can truly let go of the thoughts and opinions because that’s all they are, the world will be your oyster. Just ‘do you’ and be happy.

In Yu Dan’s book Confucius From The Heart , he talks about the necessity for benevolent, kind and frugal rulers, the importance of inner moral harmony and its direct connection with harmony in the physical world and how rulers and teachers are important role models for the wider society.

Find the things that make you happy, do more of it. Find the things that make you unhappy, do less of it.

# Where The Sidewalk Ends (Silverstein, Shel)

But all the magic I have known I’ve had to make myself.

This boat that we just built is just fine- And don’t try to tell us it’s not. The sides and the back are divine- It’s the bottom I guess we forgot….

And all the colors I am inside Have not been invented yet.

Oh, if you’re a bird, be an early bird And catch the worm for your breakfast plate. If you’re a bird, be an early early bird- But if you’re a worm, sleep late.

Ricky was “L” but he’s home with the flu, Lizzie, our “O,” had some homework to do, Mitchell, “E” prob’ly got lost on the way. So I’m all of love that could make it today.

If the world was crazy, you know what I’d do? I’d walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe, I’d fly through the ground and I’d skip through the air, I’d run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair. When I met somebody I’d say “G’bye, Joe,” And when I was leaving-then I’d say “Hello.” And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy So I would be king … if the world was crazy.

How do we tell if a window is open? Just throw a stone at it. Does it make a noise? It doesn’t? Well, it was open. Now let’s try another… CRASH! It wasn’t!.

Chester come to school and said, “Durn, I growed another head.” Teacher said,”It’s time you knowed The word is ‘grew’ instead of ‘growed.’.

Sweet Marie, she loves just me (She also loves Maurice McGhee). No she don’t, she loves just me (She also loves Louise Dupree). No she don’t, she loves just me (She also loves the willow tree). No she don’t, she loves just me! (Poor, poor fool, why can’t you see She can love others and still love thee.).

Standing on my elbow With my finger in my ear, Biting on a dandelion. And humming kind of queer While I watched a yellow caterpillar Creeping up my wrist, I leaned on a tree And I said to me, “Why am I doing this?”.

I’m Reginald Clark, I’m afraid of the dark So I always insist on the light on, And my teddy to hug. And my blanket to rub. And my thumby to suck or to bite on. And three bedtime stories. Two trips to the toilet. Two prayers, and five hugs from my mommy, I’m Reginald Clark, I’m afraid of the dark So please do not close this book on me.

# Save the Cat! Writes a Novel (Jessica Brody)

The word “plot” on its own is pretty useless. It’s just a series of events that happen in a story.

But structure is the order in which those events happen and, maybe even more importantly, the timing of when they happen. Then you add in a character who needs to change and does change by the end, and.

But structure is the order in which those events happen and, maybe even more importantly, the timing of when they happen. Then you add in a character who needs to change and does change by the end, and presto! You’ve got a story worth telling.

How do you create a hero who is interesting, memorable, and relatable, a hero whom readers want to read about? A hero worthy of an entire novel written about them?.

That’s why it shouldn’t be easy for your hero to get what they want. It should be hard. They should have to work for.

That’s why it shouldn’t be easy for your hero to get what they want. It should be hard. They should have to work for it.

If it was easy for yout hero to get what they wanted, then there is no story to be told about that hero of yours.

Louisa in Me Before You by Jojo Moyes goes from just wanting a job to help provide for her family to wanting to save Will’s life.

When a hero wants something, it sets them in motion. It gets them off their butt and into the action, which is exactly where we want them to be!.

When really these wants are just Band-Aids covering a deeper problem.

# All The Lonely People (Mike Gayle)

It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams.

It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams. But there were moments, usually when he least expected, when he felt her absence so intensely he could barely draw breath.

‘Now tell me, girl, why does a fancy, la-di-dah academic like you want to know what a boring old man like me has been doing with his days? You a glutton for punishment?’.

‘Oh, Dad,’ chided Rose, ‘what are you like? You really should take an interest in your friends, you know. They’re good for your health. I came across a very interesting study the other day that said people with a small group of good friends are more likely to live longer.’.

‘Will you give it a try?’ Hubert had his reservations but Rose was someone he simply couldn’t say no to.

‘Hubert,’ she would say, ‘you need to spend less time fixing on the problem and more time working out what you’re going to do about it!’ And as he lay there in bed it occurred to him that she was right. Lying around feeling sorry for himself wasn’t going to sort anything out. What he needed was a solution to his current predicament. A way forward. A plan.

‘He’s been such a good friend to me and me hate the idea of him ending up alone.’.

When you don’t see someone regularly you imagine them carrying on their lives as they’d always done from one year to the next but the truth was things changed.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

In fact, soon Hubert began to quantify how good or bad a day was simply by the quality and quantity of interactions he had with Joyce.

Believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce.

But in a short space of time he went from believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce would go out with him to becoming convinced that if he just said the right thing in the right way and looked handsome and debonair while doing it, he might be in with a chance.

‘I’ve got a question for you … What are you doing Saturday night?’ Hubert stared at her confused. ‘Me … me … got no plans.’ ‘Good,’ she replied. ‘In that case you’re taking me to the five o’clock showing of South Pacific at the Regal in Blackfriars.’ Hubert stood frozen to the spot, speechless. A wry smile played on Joyce’s lips. ‘What? You haven’t seen it already, have you?’ Even if he had, twenty times, he would gladly see it twenty times more if it meant going with her. ‘No, me haven’t seen it.’ ‘Good,’ said Joyce. ‘Then I’ll meet you outside the Regal at four thirty so we can chat before the film.’.

He grinned in the lift on the way back down to the warehouse. He grinned as he passed Mr Coulthard yelling at the new lads. And he grinned all the more later when Kenneth told him a very odd story about being sent on a wild-goose chase to the fourth floor by a girl from haberdashery.

‘Of course I do,’ said Ashleigh. ‘And yes, I know sometimes the world’s a horrible place but not always. Sometimes it’s a lovely place where nice things happen for no reason and I’d much rather …’ She began to get upset. ‘… I’d much rather live in that world than the other one!’.

It was a kiss that didn’t so much say goodbye as hello.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy. At the time he had thought the idea nonsense – how could the man ever be happy knowing that he’d never be with his girl again? – but in this moment Hubert finally understood the character’s motivation. In this moment he knew that he too would do anything, absolutely anything to prevent his girl from enduring pain no matter what the cost to himself.

‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’.

‘Me tried to read one once,’ confessed Hubert, ‘but me didn’t get very far. Couldn’t make head nor tail of it!’ As Ashleigh flicked through one of the books, Hubert pointed out the dedication inside, which read, ‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’ Hubert laughed. ‘That’s the one part of this book me never get tired of reading!’.

‘Me think your daughter will be whatever she wants to be,’.

‘Joyce Anne Pierce, would you do me the honour of being my wife? And not because of the baby, and not because you have nowhere else to go, but because me don’t want to waste another single minute without you.’.

When.

Sajjan: 3284.

The moment it had dawned on him that he wasn’t an island. That, in spite of himself, he missed the company of other human beings. No, he wasn’t really in the mood for cake, company or conversation but he had to acknowledge that this was something he needed, even if it wasn’t necessarily what he wanted.

It was meant to be a thankyou not a death threat.

What is it them always say? It’s the thought that counts.’.

“Sometimes the best way to get to know a new place is to get lost in it.”’.

‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

‘Joyce, you know you can’t pick a fight with everyone who has something to say about us, don’t you?’ ‘I know,’ she whispered in the darkness. ‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

Joyce bit her lip. Sometimes she was so ashamed of this country she called home, she could cry.

‘I bet you wish you’d never come sometimes.’ Hubert fell silent, clearly struggling with his answer. ‘If me being honest me do sometimes,’ he said eventually. ‘But then me think about you and Rose, and the wonderful life we’re going to have together and me say to myself, “Hubert Bird, what are you talking about? You is the luckiest man alive.”’.

‘It will be my way of saying thank you to you, Mr Hubert, for your kindness with the pineapple juice.’.

‘If anybody had tried to steal my Joyce on our wedding day, me would’ve boxed them ears!’.

‘The days ain’t half long sometimes when you’re on your own,’.

‘You needn’t look so worried!’ teased Jan. ‘I’m done with romance, Hubert. All I need these days are my soaps, a good murder mystery to curl up with on a rainy day and some quality company every now and again. So what do you say?’.

‘Smiler, you know me, I’m not the settling kind. I don’t like to be boxed in and it felt like everything Lois was doing was about building a great big box to keep me in.’.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom? Gus had been happy with Lois, that was.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom?.

Gus had spoken about it as if it was a trap but Hubert didn’t feel trapped at all.

Before he knew what he was doing, Hubert was on his feet too, taking Joyce’s hand and holding it tightly in his. As he met the gaze of first Joyce’s father and then each of her brothers, Hubert told himself he was ready for whatever happened next. As far as he was concerned, his wife’s battles were his and that was just the way it was and would always be.

Hubert pulled out his handkerchief and wiped away sweat both real and imaginary.

Though she might not be here any more, Joyce was still his girl.

‘Well, if you’re really not interested in her that way, Hubert, then make sure you’re totally honest with her, because one thing you’ve got to know about us ladies is that we’re eternal optimists!’.

‘Kids,’ she said, spearing a new potato on her fork and dipping it into the salad cream, ‘you raise them the best you can, make all the sacrifices in the world, give them all the love in the universe and all they do is break your heart.’.

The world is moving so fast and no one’s got time to stop these days. It’s sad really. I read a thing in the paper last week while I was having my break at work. Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

‘There are so many lonely people around these days,’ she said. ‘I see it at the vet’s all the time: old dears whose only friend in the world is their pet and who want nothing more than a little chat when they pop in for worming medicine or whatever. The world is moving so fast and no one’s got time to stop these days. It’s sad really. I read a thing in the paper last week while I was having my break at work. Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

Then, holding the bouquet out over the water, he released his grip and as it fell through the air then finally into the river below, Hubert thought about Joyce, their life together and how, even now, nearly thirteen years on, he still missed her with every fibre of his being.

Distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

With her eyes still closed, she reached over and took his hand and together they listened to the sounds of the children playing, of the sparrows chirping in the holly bush behind them, of the distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

Sometimes, as his Joyce used to say, instead of waiting around for somebody else to do something, you have to be that person. Sometimes you just have to go big or go home.

How could his two babies both look so grown up when it had only been yesterday that they would crawl into his lap to watch TV? It didn’t seem possible, and yet here he was, about to set one of them on a journey that would take her who knew where? Time seemed to be racing past, the clock ticking two beats for every one, and Hubert sometimes felt like he couldn’t keep up. Before he knew it, David would be leaving too, whether to university as Hubert hoped, or off pursuing dreams of his own, and then it would be just him and Joyce again, like it had been in the early days. But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person.

But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person. He wasn’t that young man any more and Joyce wasn’t that young woman. They were different, they were parents and had been for so long now that it was almost impossible to conceive of a life when they were anything else.

It was only when he and Jan were in place that it occurred to Hubert just how nervous he was about facing the general public. After all, it was one thing to pass the time of day with someone, but it was quite another to attempt to recruit them into volunteering their time and commitment.

Some people are like sun. They are admired when they come and when they go. You spend the rest of the time avoiding them, looking for some shade. But some people are like moon. You don't take notice of the time when they come. And like moon, they have an habit of disappearing in the lovely night. Every time they come, they are a little different. They are not the brightest, in fact the shine they carry is not even their own, they only reflect. However, you can spend the entire night fathoming their beauty. And entire day longing their company. Some people are the moon of our life.

‘I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that she’s my baby girl and nobody, not even Prince Charles himself, is going to be good enough for her.’.

‘Well, tough, you shouldn’t have been so greedy and eaten your lunch as a mid-morning snack!’.

There was another long, awkward pause, then Jan said, ‘Hubert, I don’t mean to pry but about earlier … you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to. But I just want you to know that if you need to talk, I’m here to listen.’.

‘I’m Zara, and I’ll be doing your make-up this morning. Not that there’s a lot to do. You have the most amazing skin and cheekbones to die for! Anyway, take a seat and I’ll give you a quick powder.’.

It was the not knowing that was the most painful thing, the hope sometimes as painful as the despair.

‘Me love you from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and what’s more, me always will.’.

‘It’s easy to waste a lot of time trying to think of a perfect solution to a problem. But sometimes the only thing you can do is cross your fingers and have a go.’.

“Smiler, this damn tea so weak it nearly a fortnight!”.

Each time he had been to see Gus before now, he had come wanting something from his friend: the first to renew their friendship for Rose’s sake and the second to find out what had gone so wrong in his old friend’s life. This time around he wanted it to be different: he didn’t want anything from Gus other than to share a meal and remember the old days. Hubert had been prepared to sit in silence while Gus ignored both him and the food. This then was a pleasant surprise, a glimmer of how they used to be and, he hoped, a spark that might reignite the fire of their friendship.

At the time of their wedding, lots of people had doubted whether the marriage would last, the odds being so stacked against them, but what they didn’t know, what they couldn’t know unless they were in Hubert and Joyce’s shoes, was that even though they had been married in a down-at-heel register office in Brixton rather than a fancy church, even though there had been no big wedding party, no lavish gifts, no honeymoon, they had meant every single word of their vows: ‘For better for worse … in sickness and in health, ’til death us do part.’.

One lot break into your house and the other suck the money straight from your bank account!.

She left the room, leaving Hubert to consider the future. No more pantomime with the telephone, no more Rose, no more fooling himself that his life was anything other than what it was: day after day of emptiness. His mind flicked back to that moment with Jan and the kiss they’d shared, a moment that now seemed to belong to another time.

Anyway, avoiding people was easy once you learned how, and with every day that passed it seemed to be getting easier.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’ ‘Me know. And me didn’t exactly make it easy for you and for that me sorry. You of all people didn’t deserve to be shut out like that.’.

Now that she had recovered herself, there was an unmistakable frostiness in her tone.

‘Jan,’ began Hubert, ‘you have every right to be upset. You’ve been nothing but a friend to me and me have behave … well, it can’t have been nice for you.’ ‘You mean worrying about you day and night?’ said Jan. ‘You mean going over and over everything I’d said and done? You mean knocking on your door, calling you, even writing letters only to be completely ignored? No, it wasn’t nice. It wasn’t nice at all.’.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort her.’.

‘Oh, Hubert. Of course it’s possible. I don’t think I could ever be angry with you for any length of time.

‘No, you don’t,’ said Hubert. ‘Until me met you, me hadn’t even given romance a second thought. Why would me do that, when lightning never strikes in the same place twice? But then me got to know you, and me spend time in your company and well … all me can say is that you, Jan, you is a mighty fine woman, and me wish with me whole heart that me could be saying that me want us to be together.

‘Oh Hubert, the important thing is that you don’t have to go through anything alone any more. You’ve got Ashleigh and Layla, you’ve got your friend Gus back on the scene, you’ve got all the committee, and last but not least, you’ve got a friend in me for life, if nothing else.’.

‘You see, the key to helping other people out of them loneliness is nothing more difficult than good old-fashioned perseverance. It’s not always easy, me know that, but you’ve got to be willing to keep doors open, to carry on trying even if it doesn’t look like it’s working. You’ve got to refuse to give up on people, even if them given up on themselves.’ He paused again, reflecting on just how lonely he’d been all those years, how cut off from the rest of the world.

‘And that’s the funny thing about life. Extraordinary things can happen to ordinary people like you and me, but only if we open ourselves up enough to let them.’.

In fact, to choose to continue living was to honour the memory of those he had loved and lost, a celebration of the life they had once shared.


# The Midnight Library (Matt Haig)

It was hard not to compare Mrs Elm to her mother, who treated Nora like a mistake in need of correction.

Even on days when it wasn’t raining she would spend her afternoon break in the small library.

‘Dad thinks I’ve thrown everything away. Now I’ve stopped swimming.’.

‘Well, far be it from me to say, but there is more to this world than swimming really fast.

But she’d been feeling lonely. And though she’d studied enough existential philosophy to believe loneliness was a fundamental part of being a human in an essentially meaningless universe, it was good to see him.

Great. I was thinking of doing a half-marathon and then I remembered I hate running.’.

As if he was Confucius contemplating a deep philosophical truth about the universe rather than the boss of a musical equipment shop dealing with a late employee.

‘So, what happened?’ She gave the short version. ‘It was a lot of pressure.’ ‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’.

‘So, what happened?’ She gave the short version. ‘It was a lot of pressure.’ ‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ She didn’t correct his knowledge of diamonds. She didn’t tell him that while coal and diamonds are both carbon, coal is too impure to be able, under whatever pressure, to become a diamond. According to science, you start off as coal and you end up as coal. Maybe that was the real-life lesson.

‘I’m afraid, Nora’ – he paused for a moment, about the time it takes to lift an axe into the air – ‘I’m going to have to let you go.’.

The town was a conveyor belt of despair.

The universe tended towards chaos and entropy. That was basic thermodynamics. Maybe it was basic existence too.

‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’.

As Nora escaped the shop, she wished there were nothing but doors ahead of her, which she could walk through one by one, leaving everything behind.

‘Cheer up, love, it might never happen,’ someone said.

She was a waterfall of apologies. She was drowning in herself.

And on the subject of summer lawns: despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh.

Mrs Elm had held her, stroking and smoothing the back of her head like a baby, not offering platitudes or false comforts or anything other than concern.

‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’.

Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed.

An unfinished jigsaw of a human.

‘Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can’t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try . . . But you are no longer within a lifetime. You have popped outside. This is your opportunity, Nora, to see how things could be.’.

Still staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person.

Still staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person. A game where you grabbed the first person you could find when the music stopped.

‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’.

If you have found a life you truly want to live, then you get to live it until you die of old age.

This was a life where she put four exclamation marks in a row. That was probably what happier, less uptight people did.

‘Dan,’ she said, as if he was something that needed identifying.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.

Nothing that dramatic. But after Izzy had gone to Australia, things had faded between them until their friendship became just a vapour trail of sporadic Facebook and Instagram likes and emoji-filled birthday messages.

Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories.

At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories.

‘And have you never walked into a room and wondered what you came in for? Have you never forgotten what you just did? Have you never blanked out or misremembered what you were just doing?’.

Maybe you have a lack problem rather than a want problem.

‘So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of bullshit.’.

And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness?.

She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness?.

Nora understood this. She thought of a study she had read about somewhere, about fish. Fish were more like humans than most people think. Fish get depression. They had done tests with zebrafish. They had a fish tank and they drew a horizontal line on the side of it, halfway down, in marker pen. Depressed fish stayed below the line. But give those same fish Prozac and they go above the line, to the top of their tanks, darting about like new.

But give those same fish Prozac and they go above the line, to the top of their tanks, darting about like new. Fish get depressed when they have a lack of stimulation. A lack of everything. When they are just there, floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all.

Maybe even suicide would have been too active. Maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don’t even try to change. Maybe that was most lives.

‘Yes,’ said Nora, aloud now. ‘Maybe I got stuck. Maybe in every life I am stuck. I mean, maybe that’s just who I am. A starfish in every life is still a starfish. There isn’t a life where a starfish is a professor of aerospace engineering. And maybe there isn’t a life where I’m not stuck.’.

A starfish in every life is still a starfish.

When we first fell in love we didn't have to tell that we love each other. Suddenly in our busy lives there was time we had for each other. Maybe all the time we had, we had for each other. Even when we were not together, we kept each other in thoughts. Life was always hard to be lived alone, but when we fell in love, we told each other, "don't be sacred, I'm there", we didn't say it out loud, we made sure that the other one felt that way..

There is a reason why people make friends who are different then they are. If people loved their own company so much, they would have befriended the mirror.

‘Librarians have knowledge. They guide you to the right books. The right worlds. They find the best places. Like soul-enhanced search engines.’.

‘For someone who has read a lot of books, you aren’t very specific with your choice of words.’.

From that moment in that car park she had felt she was really just an extension of the pain in his left knee. A walking wound.

‘The rook is my favourite piece,’ she said. ‘It’s the one that you think you don’t have to watch out for. It is straightforward. You keep your eye on the queen, and the knights, and the bishop, because they are the sneaky ones. But it’s the rook that often gets you. The straightforward is never quite what it seems.’.

‘Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.’.

Henry David Thoreau.

It was cold. Properly cold. The cold that almost burns, that hurts your fingers and toes and stiffens your cheeks.

His troublesome soul lingered on every street . . . I kept telling his memory to piss the fuck off but it wouldn’t. Grief is a bastard.

But the truth is, it only half-works, you know? Places are places and memories are memories and life is fucking life.’.

This must be the hardest bit about being a spy, she thought. The emotion people store in you, like a bad investment. You feel like you are robbing people of something.

‘If one advances confidently,’ Thoreau had written in Walden, ‘in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.’ He’d also observed that part of this success was the product of being alone. ‘I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.’.

‘That’s why everyone hates each other nowadays,’ he reckoned. ‘Because they are overloaded with non-friend friends. Ever heard about Dunbar’s number?’.

And that was the problem. In the face of death, life seemed more attractive, and as life seemed more attractive, how could she get back to the Midnight Library? She had to be disappointed in a life, not just scared of it, in order to try again with another book.

Every mistake she had ever made. Every mark on her body. Every dream she hadn’t reached or pain she had felt. Every lust or longing she had suppressed.

She imagined, now, what it would be like to accept herself completely. Every mistake she had ever made. Every mark on her body. Every dream she hadn’t reached or pain she had felt. Every lust or longing she had suppressed.

‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’.

‘But what about us? We’re doing.

I'm writting a rhyme,
don't raise expectations,
I am short on time. 
But there is a story,
that needs to be told,
Kishan has committed a crime,
But hold,
Before I tell you all about that,
there is something you should know
before santa is back.
Soon it will be midnight,
And the clock will welcome the new day with folded hands,
Cricket, they will play their sound,
Standby boat will call to say, 'me kab aau?'
And there will be a cc, or maybe a vc,
and the crane will dance.
Raksha might call, Rasha has no chance.
There will be flute music in the air,
And uk lily will sing,
Nosey will try to say something,
But Jeeru will cut him in between,
Kishan has committed a crime,
And that's the agenda prime.
A.

‘You’re overthinking this, Nora,’ said Ravi. ‘I have no other type of thinking available.’.

She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.

All good things are wild and free.

A message from Izzy.

It seems impossible to live without hurting people.’.

‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’.

‘Compassion is the basis of morality,’ the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer had written, in one of his softer moments. Maybe it was the basis of life too.

Each life she had experienced had a different feeling, like different movements in a symphony, and this one felt quite bold and uplifting. Eduardo was incredibly sweet-natured, and their marriage seemed to be a successful one.

She had known three types of silence in relationships. There was passive-aggressive silence, obviously, there was the we-no-longer-have-anything-to-say silence, and then there was the silence that Eduardo and she seemed to have cultivated. The silence of not needing to talk. Of just being together, of together-being. The way you could be happily silent with yourself.

You didn’t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.

You didn’t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed. Equally, enjoying a life didn’t mean you stayed in that life. You only stayed in a life for ever if you couldn’t imagine a better one, and yet, paradoxically, the more lives you tried the easier it became to think of something better, as the imagination broadened a bit more with every new life she sampled.

Single moment could contain both intense pleasure and intense pain, as if both were dependent on each other, like a pendulum in motion. A simple walk outside and she could feel a heavy sadness simply because the sun had slipped behind a cloud.

Single moment could contain both intense pleasure and intense pain, as if both were dependent on each other, like a pendulum in motion. A simple walk outside and she could feel a heavy sadness simply because the sun had slipped behind a cloud. Yet, conversely, meeting a dog who was clearly grateful for her attention caused her to feel so exultant that she felt she could melt into the pavement with sheer bliss. In that life she had a book of Emily Dickinson poems beside her bed and she had a playlist called ‘Extreme States of Euphoria’ and another one called ‘The Glue to Fix Me When I Am Broken’.

In one life she spent all day arguing with people she didn’t know on Twitter and ended a fair proportion of her tweets by saying ‘Do better’ while secretly realising she was telling herself to do that.

‘You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’.

“It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”’.

‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’.

She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’ And Ash only saw the Nora he had fallen in love with and married, and so, in a way, that was the Nora she was becoming.

‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’.

We don’t have to play every game to know what winning feels like.

We don’t have to play every game to know what winning feels like. We don’t have to hear every piece of music in the world to understand music. We don’t have to have tried every variety of grape from every vineyard to know the pleasure of wine. Love and laughter.

It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from.

The paradox of volcanoes was that they were symbols of destruction but also life. Once the lava slows and cools, it solidifies and then breaks down over time to become soil – rich, fertile soil.

She wasn’t a black hole, she decided. She was a volcano. And like a volcano she couldn’t run away from herself. She’d have to stay there and tend to that wasteland. She could plant a forest inside herself.


# I Will Not Die an Unlived Life: Reclaiming Purpose and Passion (Dawna Markova)

When I was ten, I read about Helen Keller and Joan of Arc and Wonder Woman, and for a few years I believed that if I did what my heart told me to do, I could help create less suffering in the world, and maybe even a little more joy. When people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I told them I wanted to make the world a better place.


# No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness (Michelle Segar)

I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

One day after school, when I was at odds with myself and the world, I decided to put on my sneakers and jog around the neighborhood. I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

Although I’ve always enjoyed running, I really love to walk. I rely on walking not only to nourish my body but also to clear my mind.

My interdisciplinary research challenges the status quo within the health promotion and healthcare industries by showing that logical rewards like “health” and “weight loss” do not motivate people to sustain health-related behavior as well as immediate and emotional rewards such as “well-being.”.

Yet the secret to achieving sustainable self-perpetual behavior change lies precisely in understanding how to create goals, motivation, and behavior that reflect what is most aligned with and meaningful to our sense of self.

No Sweat is written for individuals looking for real and sustainable ways to feel better, live better, and become happier, healthier, and fit.

Some personal projects may be focused on achievement (for example, learning to play the piano) or obtaining something (getting that promotion). Other personal projects focus on the process (spending time with your family, being a better parent, trying to relax more). They may be things you choose to do (read a book for pleasure), things you have to do (get your teeth cleaned, find a second job), things you are working toward (that trip to the Galapagos, learning to control your temper), or things you are trying to avoid (going into debt, fighting with your partner).


# What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky (Lesley Nneka Arimah)

His stepmother regards him as one would a stray dog that comes by often enough that she knows its face, but she’ll be.


# The Sicilian (Mario Puzo)

Though he was smiling, it was a face that made you dream of murder.

Don Croce immediately led him into the garden, for like all Sicilians he ate his meals out of doors when he could.

He drove carefully and slowly, as men do who have learned to drive motor vehicles late in life.

Michael thought, What the hell was the man saying? Why couldn't he get a straight answer from any of them? Because this was Sicily, he thought. Sicilians had a horror of truth. Tyrants and Inquisitors had tortured them for the truth over thousands of years. The government in Rome with its legal forms demanded the truth. The priest in the confessional box commanded the truth under pain of everlasting hell. But truth was a source of power, a lever of control, why should anyone give it away?.

He aims a gun forward and slaughters his friend by his side.

"Tell the truth, all Sicilians prefer smelling the shit of their villages to the best perfumes in Paris. What am I doing here? I could have escaped to Brazil like some others. Ah, we love where we are born, we Sicilians, but Sicily does not love us.".

He always had such grand ideas, he always talked of justice. A true Sicilian talks of bread.".

In his first days as an outlaw he looked down from the mountains but could not see. And I looked up and could not see. But we felt each other's presence, each other's love.

The girl could go, she was bound only by love, not by blood.

There were a hundred children for each olive that fell to the ground, and these children were like locusts.

"What a nuisance life is. I have work to do on my land and yet when my neighbor asked me to do this little favor, how could I refuse? My father knew his father, my grandfather his grandfather. And it is my nature, perhaps my misfortune that I will do anything a friend asks me to do. After all, are we not Christians together?".

In the street Turi Guiliano felt his moodiness fade with the sheer beauty of the day. The golden sun was glorious, the smell of lemon and olive trees filled the air. He loved the town of Montelepre, its crooked streets, the stone houses with their balconies filled with those gaudy flowers that grew in Sicily without the slightest encouragement.

"If we could all live like donkeys, eh, what a life.".

"These are hard times," he said to Guiliano. "The promised reward of heaven is too far away, men must have some pleasure now. God will forgive them.".

Don Croce had never believed in the divine right of kings, indeed he asserted that no reasonable human being had ever believed in it except when the alternative was being torn apart by four wild horses.

Don Croce indignantly boasted that he had never used torture of any kind. Simple murder sufficed.

For Don Croce believed that greediness was the greatest of all human failings, and he shared his profits freely. He was more.

It was bad enough to be an outlaw, but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous. "That's.

It was bad enough to be an outlaw, but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous.

When did the dreams of heroes begin, if not when sitting in a lonely glen, talking to dear friends.

And his godson would be another of these heroes, not understanding that for Sicily to change, there would have to be a moral volcano that would incinerate the land.

A belief in one's own virtue is far more dangerous than a belief in one's cunning.

Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta.

They were best friends and they were the center of each other's universe. Their friendship revolved around the fact that they were there, not only when they needed each other, but also when they did not.

Man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

"A man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

For say what you would of a Sicilian: that they were born criminals, that they murdered as easily as a woman picks flowers, that they were as cunningly treacherous as Turks, that they were socially three hundred years behind the times; yet no one could dispute that Sicilians loved, no, they idolized children.

Even a Member of Parliament was called Honorable to his face though everyone knew these rascals were greater thieves than anyone.

Guiliano laughed and the Prince was charmed by that youthful laugh, the boyish handsomeness of his face. But with Guiliano's answer the charm vanished. "Your government has set a price of ten million lire on my head. It would be an insult to Your Lordship if the ransom were not ten times as high." The Prince was stunned then said ironically, "I hope my family thinks as highly of me as you do.".

"Do you really care so much for what you wear on the outside of your skin?".

And this was not uncommon in Italy. The lower classes were treated cruelly only when they fought for their economic rights.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me. And.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me.

There could not therefore be any doubt that they would become lovers, for no Sicilian believed that any male and female alone together, no matter what difference in age, could refrain.

"I'll take you to Guiliano, but keep your lupare.

But not the secrets Guiliano ordered him not to tell.

Writing a poem is easy
Writing a song is hard,
With song you need music,
And somone might have to dance.

Making a friend is easy,
Being a friend is hard,
For making you only need meeting,
For being you need to keep them in heart, even when apart.

The Fiat skirted the.

In a corner of the garden, beneath a lemon tree, was an oval wooden table with rustic wooden chairs around.

'Don't reproach your two beautiful children who will be the pleasure and comfort of your old age. The money I have given them is far greater than you have lost. And know this: From today on, you and your children are under the protection of GUILIANO.'.

"But what made me love him was the pleasure he received in doing a good deed. He was really delighted to help someone else. That never changed. I always saw the same pleasure, as if he gained more from the giving than they did from the taking. That is why the people of Sicily love him.".

Pisciotta was a man who could never trust anyone completely and was therefore a man who by definition could not be trusted by anyone completely.

Waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as.

"Let's talk Sicilian together," the Don said gravely. "When we are children, when we are young, it is natural to love our friends, to be generous to them, to forgive their faults. Each day is fresh, we look forward to the future with pleasure and without fear. The world itself is not so dangerous; it is a happy time. But as we grow old and have to earn our bread, friendship does not endure so easily. We must always be on our guard. Our elders no longer look after us, we are no longer content with those simple pleasures of children. Pride grows in us – we wish to become great or powerful or rich, or simply to guard ourself against misfortune. I know how much you love Turi Guiliano, but now you must ask yourself, what is the price of this love? And after all these years does it still exist or is it just the memory that exists?" He waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as white. For Pisciotta's face had gone very pale.

"You warned me about his attack on my hotel. That was an act of friendship?".

"That is Sicily," the Don said. "There is always treachery within treachery.".

It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

For the first time the Don showed annoyance. He poured himself another glass of anisette and drank it down. He pointed a finger at his son. "You wanted to learn," he said. "Now listen to me. A man's first duty is to keep himself alive. Then comes what everyone calls honor. This dishonor, as you call it, I willingly take upon myself. I did it to save your life as you once took on dishonor to save mine. You would never have left Sicily alive without Don Croce's protection. So be it. Do you want to be a hero like Guiliano, a legend? And dead? I love him as the son of my dear friends, but I do not envy him his fame. You are alive and he is dead. Always remember that and live your life not to be a hero but to remain alive. With time, heroes seem a little foolish." Michael sighed. "Guiliano had no choice," he said. "We are more fortunate," the Don said. It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

When they are free they abuse their health – they smoke to excess, they drink to drunkenness, they fornicate to exhaustion. They don't sleep enough or get enough exercise. Then when they have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, they do push-ups, they spurn tobacco, they watch their diet and are moderate in all things.".

The piece of paper Hector Adonis had slipped inside Aspanu's shirt read so die all who betray guiliano.

Ah, Sicily, Sicily, he thought, you destroy your best and bring them to dust. Children more beautiful than the angels spring from your earth and turn into demons. The evil flourish in this soil like the bamboo and the prickly pear. And yet why was Don Croce here to lay flowers at Guiliano's grave?.

By remaining faithful, Pisciotta would have been forgotten, Guiliano would fill the legend alone. But by committing his great crime, he would stand alongside his beloved Turi forever.

Pisciotta would be buried in this same cemetery. The two of them would gaze forever at their cherished mountains, those same mountains that held the skeleton of Hannibal's elephant, that once echoed with the great blasts of Roland's horn when he died fighting the Saracens. Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta had died young, but they would live, if not forever, certainly longer than Don Croce or himself, Professor Hector Adonis.


# The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War (Ben MacIntyre)

The spy was being spied upon by his fellow spies.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it. The Soviet spy service was in his heart.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it.

“Better that ten innocent people should suffer than one spy get away,” said Nikolai Yezhov, chief of the NKVD.

NKVD, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Stalin’s secret police and the precursor of the KGB.

“The NKVD is always right,” he said: a conclusion both wholly sensible and entirely wrong.

The elder Gordievsky was a prime example of the species Homo Sovieticus, an obedient state servant forged by Communist repression. But underneath he was fearful, horrified, and perhaps gnawed by guilt. Oleg later came to see his father as “a frightened man.”.

From boyhood, Oleg saw that it was possible to live a double life, to love those around you while concealing your true inner self, to appear to be one person to the external world and quite another inside.

For hours he would run, through Moscow’s streets and parks, alone with his thoughts.

“Only a physical barrier, reinforced by armed guards in their watchtowers, could keep the East Germans in their socialist paradise and stop them fleeing to the West.”.

“It was I, rather than she, who was being tested.”.

“ashamed of all those crimes and atrocities committed by the KGB, and simply afraid to discuss the work of the KGB with his own son.”.

.

The KGB’s “Red Banner” elite training academy, deep in the woods fifty miles north of Moscow, was code-named School 101, an ironic and entirely unconscious echo of George Orwell’s Room 101 in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the basement torture chamber where the Party breaks a prisoner’s resistance by subjecting him to his worst nightmare.

Gordievsky adopted his first spy name. Soviet and Western intelligence services used the same method for choosing a pseudonym—it should be close to the real name, with the same initial letter, because that way if a person addressed you by your real name, someone who only knew you by your spy name might well assume he or she had misheard. Gordievsky chose the name “Guardiyetsev.”.

There was calculation as well as control in this: a married KGB officer was considered less likely to defect while abroad, since his wife and family could be held as hostages.

Oleg was rejected for illegals work: according to KGB logic, having more than one family member abroad, and particularly having two in the same country, might be an inducement to defect.

There was a very good reason, he reflected, why ordinary Soviet citizens were not permitted to travel abroad: who but a fully indoctrinated KGB officer would be able to taste such freedoms and resist the urge to stay?.

The rezident, Leonid Zaitsev, a charming and conscientious officer, seemed oblivious to the fact that most of his underlings were incompetent, lazy, or crooked, and usually all three. They expended far more energy on fiddling their expenses than actually spying.

The broad remit of the KGB was to cultivate Danish contacts, recruit informants, and target possible agents. This, Gordievsky swiftly realized, was “an invitation to corruption,” since most officers simply invented their interactions with Danes, falsified bills, made up their reports, and pocketed their allowances. The Center does not appear to have noticed the anomaly that few of its personnel in Copenhagen spoke good Danish, and some spoke none at all.

He spoke English with a fruity upper-class accent, larded with old-fashioned Britishisms (What ho! Pip pip!), making him sound like a Russian Bertie Wooster.

He attended classical-music concerts, devoured library books, and traveled to every corner of Denmark, sometimes on spy business, but mostly for the sheer pleasure of being able to do so.

To work off his frustration, he ran every day in Copenhagen’s parks, alone, for hour after hour, returning home too exhausted to quarrel.

The Prague Spring was over, and a new Soviet winter began.

Englishman, a cheerful, back-slapping fellow who referred to the people he liked as “complete darlings” and those he did not as “prize shits.”.

Richard Bromhead was one of those Englishmen who put a great deal of effort into appearing to be a lot stupider than they really are. He was a formidable intelligence officer.

(the grease that oils the wheels of so much espionage),.

One of the oldest gambits in intelligence is “the dangle,” when one side appears to make a play for someone on the other, lures him into complicity, and gains his trust, before exposing him.

Here, finally, was the hint of collusion—not a flash of leg exactly, but the glimpse of an ankle.

In spying, as in love, a little distance, a little uncertainty, an apparent cooling on one side or the other can stimulate desire.

“Search for people who are hurt by fate or nature—the ugly, those suffering from an inferiority complex, craving power and influence but defeated by unfavorable circumstances….In cooperation with us, all these find a peculiar compensation. The sense of belonging to an influential and powerful organization will give them a feeling of superiority over the handsome and prosperous people around them.”.

“Intelligence agents, in my experience, are even bigger liars than journalists.”.

A degree of intellectual snobbery is common to most, the secret sense of knowing important things unknown to the person standing next to you at the bus stop. In part, spying is an act of the imagination.

Oleg Penkovsky, the Russian spy who furnished the West with crucial intelligence during the Cuban Missile Crisis, hoped to prevent nuclear war, but he also wanted prostitutes and chocolates brought to his London hotel, and demanded to meet the Queen.

He was looking for revenge, for fulfillment, but also for love.

Spies want to feel wanted, part of a secret community, rewarded, trusted, and cherished.

“a marvellous man…[who] looked at you as if nothing more important in life than you and talking to you existed at that moment.”.

The Russian euphemism for the summary death sentence was vyshaya mera, “highest measure”: the traitor was taken into a room, made to kneel, and then shot in the back of the head. Sometimes the KGB was more imaginative. It was said that Penkovsky had been cremated alive and his death filmed, as a warning to potential turncoats.

Leila knew from the outset, without ever being told, that Gordievsky was a KGB officer. The thought that his interest in such books might conceal a deeper dissidence never crossed her mind.

Double infidelity with precision and care. Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

The KGB officers in Copenhagen, Oleg explained, spent far more time inventing contacts in order to justify their expenses than actually meeting anyone. This reassuring intelligence was passed on to PET.

During the war, the Hanslope boffins produced an astonishing array of technical gadgets for spies, including secure radios, secret ink, and even garlic-flavored chocolate—issued to spies parachuting into occupied France to ensure their breath smelled convincingly French on landing.

He abandoned his own refusal to reveal names and identified every KGB officer, every illegal, and every source. Finally, he agreed to accept money.

Love often begins with an outpouring of naked truth, a passionate baring of the soul.

The friendship was also a betrayal.

“The purpose of this was twofold: if Oleg just wanted reassurance that we were continuously looking out for his interests, he could see us but not make himself visible. If he wanted to make a brush contact and pass on a physical message, he would make himself visible by means of the gray cap and Safeway bag.”.

Only years after his death did Gordievsky learn that his father had been married before he met Olga, and may have had children by this earlier, hidden marriage. Oleg,.

Only years after his death did Gordievsky learn that his father had been married before he met Olga, and may have had children by this earlier, hidden marriage.

“Real happiness is to queue all night, and then get what you want,”.

Here was further indication that Arne Treholt was an active KGB agent.

“To my good friend Oleg—Don’t believe anything you see in print! Kim Philby.”.

The KGB offered a 10 percent salary increase to officers who passed an official foreign-language course, with a maximum of two languages.

He read Churchill’s History of the Second World War, Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal, and Fielding’s Tom Jones.

The problem with buttering up the boss is that bosses tend to move on, which can mean a lot of wasted butter.

Jack Jones was one of the most respected figures in the trade union movement, a crusading socialist once described by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as “one of the world’s greatest trade union leaders.” He was also a KGB agent.

Lenin is often credited with coining the term “useful idiot,” poleznyi durak in Russian, meaning one who can be used to spread propaganda without being aware of it or subscribing to the goals intended by the manipulator.

His colleagues were convinced Britain would be defeated by plucky little Argentina.

Tall and spare, with thick spectacles and a mustache that never seemed fully confident of itself, he was hard to spot in a group and invisible in a crowd.

He wore a trench coat to look like a spy, and practiced magic tricks. He liked fooling people.

Ames was intelligent and imaginative, but reality never seemed to measure up to his hopes or furnish him with what he considered his just deserts.

“If asked to do something he didn’t want to do, he didn’t argue: he just didn’t do it,”.

“Lying is wrong, son, but if it serves a greater good, it’s OK,”.

Greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

And a greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

Disloyalty was not a sin, but an operational tool.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared. He was wrong: the essence of successful agent running is the maintenance of trust, the supplanting of one allegiance by another, higher, loyalty.

“Remember ’68”—to give the impression that the Turkish population was outraged by the Soviet invasion. He dumped the posters in a bin and went for a drink.

The revelation that Richard Nixon had used the CIA to try to obstruct a federal investigation into the Watergate burglary in 1972 triggered a crisis within the agency and a series of investigations into its activities over the preceding twenty years.

After nearly twenty years in the CIA he understood the workings of the agency, but his career was stagnating, for which he blamed everybody else.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came on.

“She was like a breath of fresh air entering a room stale with cigar smoke,”.

There was nothing special about Ames—and that, perhaps, was the problem.

Paranoia is born of propaganda, ignorance, secrecy, and fear.

The escape plan from Moscow, Operation PIMLICO, would be kept in readiness while he was in London. The KGB was generous in its holiday entitlement, and officers tended to return on annual leave for four weeks in the winter and up to six weeks in the summer. He might also be summoned back at short notice. Whenever he was in Moscow, MI6 officers would continue to check the signal sites at the bread shop on Kutuzovsky Prospekt and the Central Market, looking out for a man with a Safeway bag. They would even do so when the spy was not in the country. The KGB closely watched all British diplomats in Moscow and bugged their apartments, while surveillance posts monitored their movements from the top of the Hotel Ukraine and the roof of the foreigners’ apartment block. Any deviation from routine might be noticed; if they regularly walked past the bread shop when Gordievsky was in Moscow, stopped doing so when he was absent, and started again when he returned, the pattern might just be detected.

But there was one aspect of the Gordievsky trove that made the top brass of British intelligence and security sit up and swallow, hard.

The Kremlin, however, assuming that capitalism penetrated every aspect of Western life, believed that a “blood bank” was, in fact, a bank, where blood could be bought and sold.

In a craven and hierarchical organization, the only thing more dangerous than revealing your own ignorance is to draw attention to the stupidity of the boss.

But obedience was more powerful than common sense in the world of Soviet intelligence, and KGB stations across the world dutifully began searching for evidence of hostile plans.

In spy jargon such information is known as “chicken feed,” genuine but not seriously damaging information that can be given to an enemy to establish an agent’s bona fides, bulky, filling, but lacking in any real nutritional value.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that. He was using her to improve his standing within the KGB. She thought she was striking a blow against the Soviet Union. Here was another example of the combined trickery and tenderness inherent in espionage: a friendship between a British Tory researcher and a Russian Soviet diplomat, both of whom were secret spies. They were lying to each other, with genuine affection.

He would eventually betray the entire CIA spy network inside the Soviet Union, sending many agents to their deaths.

Working out of Deverell’s office, they were sealed off from the rest of MI5 while they dug, a secret cell within a secret department of a secret organization.

A mole does not just foment mistrust. Like a heretic, he undermines the coherence of faith itself.

Storm trooper,”.

Bettaney wanted to know, and conceal, a bigger secret than the spy sitting alongside him.

Felt I needed radically to influence events.” Bettaney did not want money, revolution, or world peace; he wanted attention.

If the marks of potential treachery are being clever, eccentric, and inclined to have a few too many drinks, then half the wartime and postwar spies in Britain and America would have been suspect.

There was a hidden solitude in the heart of his marriage.

“Do they ever ask themselves what is the purpose of life? What is it all for?…No. Their creed is barren of conscience, immune to the promptings of good and evil.”.

The psychological gratification of all intelligence work lies in knowing more than your adversaries, but also more than your allies.

“Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”.

The CIA had won a small but satisfying professional victory over MI6. The Brits thought they knew something the Americans did not know; but now the CIA knew something that MI6 did not know they knew. That is how the game is played. Oleg Gordievsky was assigned the random CIA code name TICKLE, a neutral-sounding label to go with a little harmless international rivalry.

“Everyone has a right to their own strangeness.”.

Ames was truculent. His breath smelled and his job stank. He felt underappreciated by the CIA. But he would later offer a simpler explanation for his actions: “I did it for the money.” He needed to pay for Rosario’s shopping trips to Neiman Marcus and dinners at the Palm restaurant. He wanted to move out of his one-bedroom apartment, pay off his ex-wife, hold an expensive wedding, and own his car outright.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved. Gordievsky had never been interested in the money. Ames was interested in nothing else.

The KGB was a cumbersome beast, but it could move fast when it needed to.

His systematic betrayal of every Soviet agent on the CIA’s books would not take place for another month. In memoirs published in 2005, Cherkashin claimed the crucial tip-off about Gordievsky came not from Ames, but from a shadowy informant, “a Washington-based British journalist.” The CIA dismisses this as disinformation designed to reflect well on the KGB, with “all the earmarks of being a false lead.”.

In the 1980s he had served in East Germany, where one of the KGB officers under his command was the young Vladimir Putin.

He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor.

It is perfectly possible for two people to listen to the same words and hear entirely different things. This was one of those moments. Brown thought he was offering Oleg a way out, while reminding him that this might waste a golden opportunity. Gordievsky believed he was being instructed to return to Moscow. He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor. But Brown, as instructed, gave no such direction. The decision was Gordievsky’s.

“People say that when soldiers hear the artillery start, they go into a sort of panic. That is what happened to me. I could not even remember the escape plan. But then I thought: ‘The plan is unreliable anyway. I should forget about it, and just look forward to the bullet in the back of the neck.’ I was paralyzed.”.

Here he was being accused of treason, and the chief investigator was defending the quality of KGB sandwiches.

When the senior MI6 officer liaising with the MI5 eavesdropping team was asked how the alarm raised by Gordievsky could possibly have been missed, he offered a quotation from Horace: Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus, often translated as “Even Homer nods.” The most highly trained experts can still be caught napping.

Price had been told that the mosquitoes could be fierce on the Russian-Finnish border in early summer. So she bought some mosquito repellent.

The only way husband and wife could communicate at home was by passing notes, in bed, under the sheets. Usually these were written in fountain pen with soluble ink on toilet paper that could then be flushed. “We were under constant watch. There was almost no privacy, ever, anywhere. It was exhausting, and quite stressful.” Even in the embassy, the only place to be sure a conversation was not overheard was the “safe-speech room” in the basement, “a sort of Portakabin surrounded by noise within an empty space.”.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance. He told her nothing, and she believed him.

‘I am your rock,’ I said. ‘Don’t worry. Drink if you want to. I don’t mind.’ ”.

The many perks of KGB membership included access to various health spas and holiday centers.

“All of the people on my June 13 list knew the risks they were taking. If one of them learned about me, he would have told the CIA and I would have been arrested and thrown in jail…It wasn’t personal. It was simply how the game was played.”.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare:.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare: from Nazi Germany to Communist Russia to Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and North Korea today, a willingness to betray those nearest to you for the greater good was the ultimate mark of committed citizenship and ideological purity.

The decision to leave his family behind was either an act of monumental self-sacrifice, or one of selfish self-preservation, or both. He told himself he had no choice, which is what we all tell ourselves when forced to make a terrible choice.

And part of his heart broke.

William Shakespeare has an answer for most of life’s questions. In Hamlet, the greatest writer in the English language pondered the nature of fate and courage, when life’s challenges seem overwhelming. “When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.”.

It was Arthur Gee’s turn to monitor the signal site, but the traffic was slow.

“I drove on, feeling as if the world had fallen in and I had done the wrong thing, for the right reasons.”.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the KGB.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him. And if they did not, the KGB was perfectly capable of sending a Spetsnaz special forces squad to do the job. The Soviets were known to monitor Finnish airports, so simply flying the family out of Helsinki was not an option.

She packed mosquito repellent, clean clothes, and a shaving kit.

She hoped the Moscow team would remember to bring additional spare tires, in good condition, in case of punctures. That, too, was in the escape plan.

“I am quite certain that the prime minister will feel we have an overwhelming moral duty to save this man.”.

“We’ll say it’s a gross provocation. We’ll say they shoved the fellow in the boot of the car.”.

Gordievsky made his preparations, appearing to do the sorts of things a man who was about to escape would not do.

His fate was now back in his own hands.

“Mr. Harrington’s Washing” is the tale of a British spy who escapes from revolutionary Russia through Finland.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

The story is about risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

Whether or not he escaped, the KGB would comb through the transcripts of his telephone conversations afterward, and realize they had been mocked: they would hate him all the more, but perhaps admire him, too.

(“It was so secret I later had a problem getting my expenses reimbursed.”).

The royal courtier fumed. If you are a private secretary, there is nothing more galling than another private secretary being more private than you are.

“She admired him hugely even though it cut against some of her principles—she hated traitors. But he was different. In a different league. She had huge respect for those who stood up to the regime.”.

He did nothing that might seem out of the ordinary, on the most extraordinary day of his life.

Then he ran through the full surveillance-evasion menu, methodically and meticulously: jumping on a Metro train as the door closed, alighting after two stops, waiting for the next train to arrive and then making certain every passenger on the platform had boarded before letting the doors close and catching a train in the opposite direction; ducking down one street, doubling back and up another, into a shop by one entrance and then out of the back.

“A thick mist had risen from the lakes and rivers, extending into long belts beside the hills and through the trees and villages. The land slowly coalesced into substantial forms out of these foaming banks of violet and rose. Three very bright planets shone out in perfect symmetry, one to the left, one to the right, and one straight ahead. We passed solitary figures already scything hay, picking herbs, or taking cows to pasture along the slopes and gullies of common land. It was a stunning sight, an idyllic moment. It was difficult to believe that any harm could come out of a day of such beginnings.”.

In Communist lore, the Finland Station is symbolic of revolutionary liberty and the birth of the Soviet Union; to Gordievsky it also represented the route to freedom, but in the opposite direction, in every sense, to Lenin.

Instead, they seem to have done what timeservers do in every autocracy that punishes honest failure: they did nothing at all, and hoped the problem would go away.

“I felt an extraordinary period of stillness at the center of the turning world,” Simon Brown recalled. He had brought along Hotel du Lac, the Booker Prize–winning novel by Anita Brookner. “I thought if I took a long book it would be tempting fate, so I took a short book.”.

Weekends are lethargic times in all large bureaucracies, when the second-tier staff comes to work and the boss relaxes.

They were playing Finlandia.

Veronica Price did not approve of emotional displays, but she was visibly moved, “her expression a mixture of recognition and love.”.

Gordievsky waved away the sandwiches and fruit juice Price had carefully packed. “I wanted whisky,” he said later. “Why didn’t they give me whisky?” Brown had expected him to be hysterical with exhaustion, but instead Gordievsky seemed “perfectly controlled.”.

Gently raised the question of his family. “It was.

“It was too much of a risk to bring them,” Gordievsky said flatly, and stared out of the window at the passing Finnish countryside.

If the KGB was still watching, they would have noticed that Rachel Gee’s bad back had miraculously recovered.

“Look. Let’s be clear. I was a wife. My job was to clean, cook, shop, sleep with him, have children, share the bed, and be his friend. I was good at it. I’m grateful he didn’t tell me anything. For six years of my life I was a perfect wife. I did everything for him. You, the KGB, you have thousands of people with salaries whose job was to check up on people; they checked him and checked him and cleared him. And you come to me and blame me? Don’t you think that sounds stupid? You didn’t do your job. It wasn’t my job, it was yours. You ruined my life.”.

Among those affected was Vladimir Putin, a product of the Leningrad KGB who saw most of his friends, colleagues, and patrons purged as a direct consequence of Gordievsky’s escape.

From his point of view he was my savior. But who put me in the shit-hole? He’d forgotten the first part. You can’t kick someone off a cliff and then put out a hand and say: ‘I saved you!’ He was so bloody Russian.” Leila could not forget, or get over, what had happened to her. They tried to reassemble a family life, but the marriage that existed before the escape was from another world, another time, and could not be wished back to life.

In the end, she felt Gordievsky’s loyalty to an idea had taken precedence over his love for her.

Ames spied for money; Gordievsky was driven by ideological conviction. Ames’s victims were rooted out by the KGB and, in most cases, killed; the people Gordievsky exposed, such as Bettaney and Treholt, were watched, intercepted, tried by due process, imprisoned, and eventually released back into society. Gordievsky risked his life for a cause; Ames wanted a bigger car. Ames chose to serve a brutal totalitarian regime for which he felt no affinity, a country where he would never have considered living; Gordievsky had tasted democratic freedom, and made it his mission to defend and support that way of life and culture, finally settling in the West at huge personal cost. In the end, the difference between them is a matter of moral judgment: Gordievsky was on the side of the good; and Ames was on his own side.

He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

Oleg Gordievsky still lives a double life. To his suburban neighbors, the bowed, bearded old man living quietly behind the tall hedges is just another old-age pensioner, a person of little consequence. In reality he is someone else entirely, a figure of profound historical importance and a remarkable man: proud, shrewd, irascible, his brooding manner illuminated by sudden flashes of ironic humor. He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

It contained the following: a Mars bar, a plastic Harrods bag, a map of western Russia, pills “for the relief of worry, irritability, insomnia and stress,” mosquito repellent, two bottles of chilled beer, and two cassette tapes: Dr. Hook’s Greatest Hits and Sibelius’s Finlandia.

They deserve far greater credit than I can give them; but, to their credit, they do not want it.

A sum of money is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a tale about bees.

All officers were officers for life, unless proved legally insane.

No member of the Rosewater Foundation could tell the Corporation what to do with the capital. Conversely, the Corporation was powerless to tell the Foundation what to do with the copious profits the Corporation made.

Leonard Leech, once told him about getting ahead in law. Leech said that, just as a good airplane pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer be looking for situations where large amounts of money were about to change hands.

"In every big transaction," said Leech, "there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient's blubbering thanks.".

Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day.

The report contained Eliot's speech to the writers word-for-word. The meeting, including Eliot's drunken interruption, had been taken down on tape. "I love you sons of bitches," Eliot said in Milford. "You're all I read any more.

You're the only ones with guts enough to _really_ care about the future, who _really_ notice what machines do to us, what wars do to us, what cities do to us, what big, simple ideas do to us, what tremendous misunderstandings, mistakes, accidents and catastrophes do to us. You're the only ones zany enough to agonize over time and distances without limit, over mysteries that will never die, over the fact that we are right now determining whether the space voyage for the next billion years or so is going to be Heaven or Hell." * Eliot admitted later on that science-fiction writers couldn't write for sour apples, but he declared that it didn't matter. He said they were poets just the same, since they were more sensitive to important changes than anybody who was writing well. "The hell with the talented sparrowfarts who write delicately of one small piece of one mere lifetime, when the issues are galaxies, eons, and trillions of souls yet to be born.".

He didn't understand that what Trout had in common with pornography wasn't sex but fantasies of an impossibly hospitable world.

In Milford, Eliot told the writers that he wished they would learn more about sex and economics and style, but then he supposed that people dealing with really big issues didn't have much time for such things.

To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

Am I in favor of feeding labor crooks to lions? Well, to give those who get such satisfaction from imagining that I am covered with primordial scales a little twinge of pleasure, let me say, "Yes. Absolutely. This afternoon, if it can be arranged." To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer. I still find it hard to realize that I am an alcoholic, though even strangers know this right away.

"You know, I think the main purpose of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps is to get poor Americans into clean, pressed, unpatched clothes, so rich Americans can stand to look at them.".

I've gone sixteen hours without a drink! I don't miss the poison at all! Cheers!.

He often carries birth-control devices in his pocket, which many people find alarming and disgusting. The same people find it alarming and disgusting that the boy's father did _not_ use birth-control devices.

"I'm going to love these discarded Americans, even though they're useless and unattractive. _That_ is going to be my work of art.".

"_hysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself_.".

Samaritrophia, _he read_, is the suppression of an overactive conscience by the rest of the mind.

"and she confessed to me that she spent the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of her life saying nothing but, 'No, thank you.' Which is all very well for a girl of that age and station. But it would have been a damned unattractive trait in a _male_ Rockefeller, and an even more unsuitable one, if I may say so, in a male Rosewater.".

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more." Eliot.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more.".

It was stashed into a foundation in order that tax-collectors and other predators not named Rosewater might be prevented from getting their hands on it.

What engaged his emotions was the fact that the Rosewater fortune was the largest single money package represented by McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. He recalled what his favorite professor,.

Mushari, who thought of himself as brave little David about to slay Goliath, was exactly half his age. And it was almost as though God Himself wanted little David to win, for confidential document after document proved that Eliot was crazy as a loon.

And Samuel bought newspapers, and preachers, too. He gave them this simple lesson to teach, and they taught it well: _Anybody who thought that the United States of America was supposed to be a Utopia was a piggy, lazy, God-damned fool_. Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day. And yet he could be thankful for the opportunity to pay a hundred thousand dollars or more for a painting by an Italian three centuries dead. And he capped this insult by giving paintings to museums for the spiritual elevation of the poor. The museums were closed on Sundays.

Giving ninety-five per cent of it to the Foundation you now control didn't cause him a twinge.

The family visited the so-called "home" in Rosewater County very briefly every year, just long enough to reinvigorate the lie that it was home.

His duties, according to the charter, were exactly as flimsy or as formidable as he himself declared them to be.

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers --joined in the serious business of keeping our food, shelter, clothing and loved ones from combining with oxygen.

He drove away his rich friends by telling them that whatever they had was based on dumb luck. He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do. He asked his scholarly friends, "Who has time to read all the boring crap you write and listen to all the boring things you say?" He alienated his friends in the sciences by thanking them extravagantly for scientific advances he had read about in recent newspapers and magazines, by assuring them, with a perfectly straight face, that life was getting better and better, thanks to scientific thinking.

Hamlet had one big edge on me. His father's ghost told him exactly what he had to do, while I am operating without instructions. But from somewhere something is trying to tell me where to go, what to do there, and why to do it. Don't worry, I don't hear voices. But there is this feeling that I have a destiny far away from the shallow and preposterous posing that is our life in New York. And I roam.

It was the one dash of reality added by Eliot's great-grandfather to a stock and bond fantasy of a canal that would join Chicago, Indianapolis, Rosewater and the Ohio.

Avondale as a constitutional monarch. They were employees of the Rosewater Corporation, and the properties they managed were owned by the Rosewater Foundation. Eliot could not tell them what to do --but he was surely the King, and Avondale knew it.

The therapist, after a deeply upsetting investigation of normality at this time and place, was bound to conclude that a normal person, functioning well on the upper levels of a prosperous, industrialized society, can hardly hear his conscience at all.

"Yes. If I don't make anything else clear tonight, at least let me make that clear: Eliot is right to do what he's doing. It's beautiful what he's doing. I'm simply not strong enough or good enough to be by his side any more. The fault is mine.".

"The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

Pained mystification, and then helplessness, suffused the Senator's face. "Tell me one good thing about those people Eliot helps." "I can't." "I thought not." "It's a secret thing," she said, forced to argue, pleading for the argument to stop right there. Without any notion of how merciless he was being, the Senator pressed on. "You're among friends now --suppose you tell us what this great secret is." "The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

"Sixty-eight years is a long time for a body to live without having one nice thing ever happen to the body. Nothing nice ever happened to me. How could it? I was behind the door when the good Lord passed out the brains.".

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If.

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If Eliot is going to love everybody, no matter what they are, no matter what they do, then those of us who love particular people for particular reasons had better find ourselves a new word.".

He looked up at an oil painting of his deceased wife. "For instance --I loved _her_ more than I loved our garbage collector, which makes me guilty of the most unspeakable of modern crimes: _Dis-crim-i-nay-tion_.".

"We don't piss in your ashtrays, So please don't throw cigarettes in our urinals.".

Stick your stainless steel spoon in this unhappy old man's brains, Doctor,' I told him, 'and stir.'.

Says, '_Don't Kill Yourself. Call the Rosewater Foundation_,' and it's got your number." Such stickers were in every phone booth in the county, and in the back windows of the cars and trucks of most of the volunteer firemen, too. "You know what somebody's written right under that in pencil?" "No.".

"The Government. If I'm not a Church, and I still want to keep people from killing themselves, I must be the Government. Right?".

"I'd ask you to name the rock-bottom price you'd charge to go on living for just one more week.".

Why do so many souls voluntarily return to Earth after failing and dying, failing and dying, failing and dying there? Because Heaven is such a null.

And those who read these lines of wit Should eat these little balls of shit.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes. I think it's terrible the way people don't share things in this country. I think it's a heartless government that will let one baby be born owning a big piece of the country, the way I was born, and let another baby be born without owning anything.

"We come to a supremely ironic moment in history, for Senator Rosewater of Indiana now asks his own son, 'Are you or have you ever been a communist?'" "Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

There's plenty for everybody in this country, if we'll only _share_.

"Sure --provided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there is a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and the powerful are,' I'd.

'Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies --: "'God damn it, you've got to be kind.'".

He came out of the Pisquontuit Drug Store, squinted in the sunlight, took three deep breaths, went into the Pisquontuit News Store next door.

The lawyers and bankers felt somewhat cheated, since George didn't seem to be drawing any sort of moral from what should have been an important experience in almost any man's life. One lawyer, who had been looking forward to pointing out the moral when George got mad, couldn't restrain himself from pointing it out anyway, even though George was laughing: "People should always _read_ things before they sign them.".

It was on top of a jelly cupboard in the cellar of Fred's home. That was where he kept the rat poison, too.

The carpenter was worth twenty thousand dollars dead, thanks to Fred. He could think of little else but suicide whenever premium time rolled around.

"It comes when I have a bride come up to me and say, 'I don't know how the children and I can ever thank you enough for what you've done. God bless you, Mr. Rosewater.'".

"And your father didn't name us your guardians in his will because he thought we would agree politely with anything you might say.

"Every year at least one young man whose affairs we manage comes into our office, wants to give his money away. He has completed his first year at some great university. It has been an eventful year! He has learned of unbelievable suffering around the world. He has learned of the great crimes that are at the roots of so many family fortunes. He has had his Christian nose rubbed, often for the very first time, in the Sermon on the Mount. "He is confused, tearful, angry! He demands to know, in hollow tones, how much money he is worth. We tell him. He goes haggard with shame, even if his fortune is based on something as honest and useful as Scotch Tape, aspirin, rugged pants for the working man, or, as in your case, brooms. You have, if I'm not mistaken, just completed one year at Harvard?" "Yes." "It's a great institution, but, when I see the effect it has on certain young people, I ask myself, 'How dare a university teach compassion without teaching history, too?' History tells us this, my dear young Mr. Buntline, if it tells us nothing else: Giving away a fortune is a futile and destructive thing. It makes winners of the poor, without making them rich or even comfortable. And the donor and his descendents become undistinguished members of the whining poor.".

Your fortune is the most important single determinant of what you think of yourself and of what others think of you. Because of the money, you are extraordinary. Without it, for example, you would not now be taking the priceless time of a senior partner in McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee.

That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

Let me see you smile! Let me see that you already understand what they do not teach at Harvard until the junior year: That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

"That's what I was _going_ to guess," said Caroline.

"People get what they deserve," said Amanita. "Isn't that right, Bunny?" "That's the First Law of Life," said Bunny Weeks.

There was never much doing in life insurance for poor people on warm afternoons.

The oath, which Selena had taken six hundred times, before six hundred very plain suppers, went like this, and was written by Castor Buntline, poor old Stewart's great-grandfather: I do solemnly swear that I will respect the sacred private property of others, and that I will be content with whatever station in life God Almighty may assign me to. I will be grateful to those who employ me, and will never complain about wages and hours, but will ask myself instead, "What more can I do for my employer, my republic, and my God?" I understand that I have not been placed on Earth to be happy. I am here to be tested. If I am to pass the test, I must be always unselfish, always sober, always truthful, always chaste in mind, body, and deed, and always respectful to those to whom God has, in His Wisdom, placed above me.

All right, we're poor! This is America! And America is one place in this sorry world where people shouldn't _have_ to apologize for being poor. The question in America should be, 'Is this guy a good citizen? Is he honest? Does he pull his own weight?'".

I've got the clap, and the blueballs, too. The clap don't hurt, but the blueballs do.

"I'm leaving," said Peach. "I know when I'm not wanted.".

"Kilgore Trout once wrote a whole book about a country that was devoted to fighting odors. That was the national purpose. There wasn't any disease, and there wasn't any crime, and there wasn't any war, so they went after odors.".

The Senator blew up. "Why do you _hate_ me so?" he cried. Eliot was flabbergasted. "Hate you? Father --I don't hate you. I don't hate anybody." "Your every act and word is aimed at hurting me as much as you possibly can!".

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use?.

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use? "In time, almost all men and women will become worthless as producers of goods, food, services, and more machines, as sources of practical ideas in the areas of economics, engineering, and probably medicine, too. So --if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are _human beings_, then we might as well, as has so often been suggested, rub them out.".

"There we have people treasuring people as people. It's extremely rare. So from this we must learn.".

"I just wish you'd stop saying you're a socialist. You're not! You're a free-enterpriser!".

"Keep away from booze, remember who you are, and behave accordingly," the Senator roundly declared. "And don't play God to people, or they will slobber all over you, take you for everything they can get, break commandments just for the fun of being forgiven --and revile you when you are gone.".

"It seems to me," said Trout, "that the main lesson Eliot learned is that people can use all the uncritical love they can get.".

"It's news that a man was able to _give_ that kind of love over a long period of time. If one man can do it, perhaps others can do it, too. It means that our hatred of useless human beings and the cruelties we inflict upon them for their own good need not be parts of human nature. Thanks to the example of Eliot Rosewater, millions upon millions of people may learn to love and help whomever they see.".

"Let their names be Rosewater from this moment on. And tell them that their father loves them, no matter what they may turn out to be. And tell them --" Eliot fell silent, raised his tennis racket as though it were a magic wand. "And tell them," he began again, "to be fruitful and multiply.".

Imagine what it would be like to see yourself dead and to discover that nobody missed you or even cared that you’d died. That’s what happens to Scrooge when he meets the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

And at the very least, the next time you hear someone described as ‘dead as a doornail’ you’ll know that it was Charles Dickens who made the phrase popular and you’ll think, as I do, of Old Marley, coming spookily to life on Scrooge’s front door.

# Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy)

There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself.


# India: A History. Revised and Updated (Keay, John)

‘Prior to the thirteenth century AD,’ wrote Professor R.C. Majumdar in the 1950s, ‘we possess no historical text of any kind, much less such a detailed narrative as we possess in the case of Greece, Rome or China.’.


# Norse Mythology (Neil Gaiman)

The gods were going to battle the frost giants, and they were all going to die.

The Norse myths are the myths of a chilly place, with long, long winter nights and endless summer days, myths of a people who did not entirely trust or even like their gods, although they respected and feared them.

You can find Tyr the one-handed (Odin’s son), Odin, Thor, and Frigg, the queen of the gods, in, respectively, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Freya’s tears, for example, was a poetic way of saying “gold.”.

As I retold these myths, I tried to imagine myself a long time ago, in the lands where these stories were first told, during the long winter nights perhaps, under the glow of the northern lights, or sitting outside in the small hours, awake in the unending daylight of midsummer, with an audience of people who wanted to know what else Thor did, and what the rainbow was, and how to live their lives, and where bad poetry comes from.

# Everybody Loves a Good Drought (P. Sainath)

Oddly, the same Government of India waved a different wand at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. And that was less than nine months before it found a fall in poverty in the country. At that summit, it presented a document saying 39.9 per cent of Indians were below the poverty line. It was, after all, begging for money from donors. The more the poor, the more the money. At home, less than 300 days later, it produced the 19 per cent estimate. (Those intrigued by the mysteries of the official poverty line can look at Appendix 1 at the back of the book.).

But I did want to escape what Swami Vivekananda once described as the propensity of the Indian elite to discuss for hours whether a glass of water ought to be taken with the left hand or the right hand. So the focus remains on people and their problems.

These were Ramnad and Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, Godda and Palamau in Bihar, Malkangiri and Nuapada in Orissa and Surguja and Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh.

These projects are just started for the money they bring, not for the Korwas or anyone else.’.

‘If the money were simply put into bank fixed deposits, none of these families would ever have to work again. The interest alone would make them very well off by Surguja’s standards.’.

In 1992, USAID gave India US $ 325 million (Rs. 800 crores) to be spent solely on population control in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This programme has serious implications. One is that hazardous contraceptives like Norplant will be pushed onto very poof rural women who have little or no access to proper health care. The same contraceptives are not in general use in any Western country.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health. The current figure of public spending is 1.3 per cent of GDP. Nicaragua spends 6.7, Brazil 2.8 and China 2.1 per cent. Among the advanced industrial nations, Sweden spends 7.9 and the United States 5.6 per cent.

Only 20 per cent of hospital beds are in rural areas where 80 per cent of Indians live.

More than a few doctors, having been trained at the expense of the poorest people in the world, settle abroad to address the ailments of affluent Americans. So some of the most deprived, disease-ridden people subsidise the health of the richest.

Lack of resources has little to do with it. Maharashtra and Gujarat are the two states praised for having been at the front line of the economic ‘reforms’. Between August 1991 and August 1994, the two attracted investments worth Rs. 114,000 crores (almost $ 38 billion). Yet, these were the states where the plague broke out. Even before the reforms began, Gujarat was spending only around Rs. 49 per capita on health. (The reform period brought more cuts.) The figure for Kerala, a much poorer state than Gujarat in economic terms, was Rs. 71.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69. The average Keralite can expect to live 72 years. For Gujaratis that figure is 61 years and for Maharashtrians 63.

Kerala’s IMR and life expectancy rates are comparable with those of the USA.

Biswas’s brother is also a ‘doctor’. Taking a diploma in homoeopathy at an institute the name of which he has regrettably forgotten, he now practises allopathy in the same village as his sibling.

Words like ‘chloroquine’ and ‘paracetamol’ are not easy to handle even for English speakers. For a tipsy dissari, mixing mantras with mahua, they can be tricky and harmful if interchanged.

And one of the first things to happen was this: the people in the PHCs there got hauled up for talking to me and ‘leaking’ stuff from the records.

The actual gap between SC/ ST literacy levels and those of the non-SC/ ST population grew worse between 1961 and 1981.

S.C. Jain saab is the principal of the Government Postgraduate College in Alirajpur. He is also in charge of all UGC programmes in the college. Besides, he is the head of the Botany department, the Physics department and the Law department. In past years, he has headed, at least temporarily, several other departments. He rounds off this portfolio by being the college sports officer. In his spare time—if a person of such onerous responsibilities can have any spare time —he practises ayurveda and homoeopathy. Clearly a man of many parts.

Less than fifteen people found jobs, at very menial levels, in HAL, which has a total workforce of around 4,500. Another thirty also got into HAL, with some difficulty, as casual labourers. They had no security of tenure. Those who ‘made it’ as casual workers were offered an alternative home—120 km away from the HAL township.

Then, too, Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Orissa. ‘And he had this grand idea that all the units of HAL would come to Koraput.’ So huge tracts of land were acquired in pursuit of that vision.

The other units of HAL came up in Bangalore and elsewhere. As a result, thousands of acres forcibly taken over from the eighteen villages remain unused to this day.

He was clearly hoping I would ask. ‘The third crop in this region is drought relief. The funds involved in it are huge but the harvest is generally reaped by block-level officials and their contractor friends.

Simply put, the Oriya migrants have to suffer because they came to Andhra Pradesh on their own. That they are very much in the grip of contractors here does not count. And secondly, the Andhra labour department cannot be held legally responsible for their plight.

# Learn to Earn (Peter Lynch)

A lot of people must have told you by now that it’s important to get a good education, so you can find a promising career that pays you a decent wage. But they may not have told you that in the long run, it’s not just how much money you make that will determine your future prosperity. It’s how much of that money you put to work by saving it and investing it.

# The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)

A marriage doesn’t begin with a proposal, or even an initial meeting. It begins far earlier, when the idea of love is born, and more specifically the dream of a soul mate.

It may come very fast, this certainty that another human being is a soul mate. We needn’t have spoken with them; we may not even know their name. Objective knowledge doesn’t come into it. What matters instead is intuition, a spontaneous feeling that seems all the more accurate and worthy of respect because it bypasses the normal processes of reason.

He will surmise that love can endure only when one is unfaithful to its beguiling opening ambitions, and that, for his relationships to work, he will need to give up on the feelings that got him into them in the first place. He will need to learn that love is a skill rather than an enthusiasm.

What we typically call love is only the start of love.

In the midst of this practical conversation, he manages nonetheless to catch the occasional glimpse of a more private side. To his question about her parents, Kirsten answers, with a note of awkwardness in her voice, that she was brought up in Inverness by her mother alone, her father having lost interest in family life early on. “It wasn’t an ideal start to make me hopeful about people,” she says with a wry smile (and he realizes it’s the left upper front tooth that is at a bit of an angle). “Maybe that’s why the thought of ‘happily ever after’ has never really been my thing.”.

Instead of which, Rabih feels certain that he has discovered someone endowed with the most extraordinary combination of inner and outer qualities: intelligence and kindness, humor and beauty, sincerity and courage; someone whom he would miss if she left the room even though she had been entirely unknown to him but two hours before; someone whose fingers—currently drawing faint lines with a toothpick across the tablecloth—he longs to caress and squeeze between his own; someone with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life.

We tend not to get very anxious when seducing people we don’t much care about.

At the perimeter of Kirsten’s life, he is at the apogee of modesty.

Love stories begin not when we fear someone may be unwilling to see us again but when they decide they would have no objection to seeing us all the time; not when they have every opportunity to run away but when they have exchanged solemn vows promising to hold us, and be held captive by us, for life.

Love stories begin not when we fear someone may be unwilling to see us again but when they decide they would have no objection to seeing us all the time; not when they have every opportunity to run away but when they have exchanged solemn vows promising to hold us, and be held captive by us, for life. Our understanding of love has been hijacked and beguiled by its first distractingly moving moments. We have allowed our love stories to end way too early. We seem to know far too much about how love starts, and recklessly little about how it might continue.

He has, without knowing how, richly succeeded at the three central challenges underpinning the Romantic idea of love: he has found the right person; he has opened his heart to her; and he has been accepted.

He loves from a feeling of incompleteness—and from a desire to be made whole.

Family folklore has it that Kirsten’s father upped and left one morning, having packed a small suitcase while his wife of ten years was off teaching. The sole explanation he provided was a slip of paper on the hallway table with “Sorry” scrawled on it. Thereafter he drifted around Scotland, taking up odd jobs on farms, keeping in touch with Kirsten only through an annual card and a gift on her birthday.

The sole explanation he provided was a slip of paper on the hallway table with “Sorry” scrawled on it. Thereafter he drifted around Scotland, taking up odd jobs on farms, keeping in touch with Kirsten only through an annual card and a gift on her birthday. When she turned twelve, a package arrived containing a cardigan fit for a nine-year-old. Kirsten sent it back to an address in Cammachmore, along with a note advising the sender of her frank hope that he would die soon. There has been no word from him since. Had he left for another woman, he would merely have betrayed his wedding vows. But to leave his wife and child simply to be by himself, to have more of his own company, without ever furnishing a satisfactory account of his motives—this was rejection on an altogether deeper, more abstract, and more devastating scale.

Love reaches a pitch at those moments when our beloved turns out to understand, more clearly than others have ever been able to, and perhaps even better than we do ourselves, the chaotic, embarrassing, and shameful parts of us. That someone else gets who we are and both sympathizes with us and forgives us for what they see underpins our whole capacity to trust and to give. Love is a dividend of gratitude for our lover’s insight into our own confused and troubled psyche.

Without shaming him, she can identify and name the forms his madness sometimes takes.

They normally have to answer to names imposed on them by the rest of the world, used on official documents and by government bureaucracies, but love inspires them to cast around for nicknames that will more precisely accord with the respective sources of their tenderness.

Her being submissive to him means allowing a loving person to tell her exactly what to do, letting him take responsibility and choice away from her.

To receive the apparently dirtiest, most private, guiltiest part of her lover into the most public, most respectable part of herself is symbolically to free them both from the punishing dichotomy between dirty and clean, bad and good—in the process, as they fly through the glacial lower atmosphere towards Scheveningen at 400 kilometers an hour, returning unity to their previously divided and shamed selves.

It tells us something about the relative status of rigorous analysis in the nuptial process that it would be considered un-Romantic, and even mean, to ask an engaged couple to explain in any depth, with patience and self-awareness, what exactly had led them to make and accept a proposal. But we’re keen, of course, always to ask where and how the proposal took place.

The prestige of instinct is the legacy of a collective traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable “reason.”.

Life on his own had become, he realized then, untenable. He had had enough of solitary walks home at the end of desultory parties; of entire Sundays passed without speaking a word to another human; of holidays spent tagging along with harassed couples whose children left them no energy for conversation; of the knowledge that he occupied no important place in anyone’s heart.

A shameful extent, the charm of marriage boils down to how unpleasant it is to be alone. This isn’t necessarily our fault as individuals. Society as a whole appears determined to render the single state as nettlesome and.

To a shameful extent, the charm of marriage boils down to how unpleasant it is to be alone. This isn’t necessarily our fault as individuals. Society as a whole appears determined to render the single state as nettlesome and depressing as possible: once the freewheeling days of school and university are over, company and warmth become dispiritingly hard to find; social life starts to revolve oppressively around couples; there’s no one left to call or hang out with. It’s hardly surprising, then, if when we find someone halfway decent, we might cling.

The success of any relationship should be determined, not just by how happy a couple are to be together, but by how worried each partner would be about not being in a relationship at all.

Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate.

He would find it so much easier to give blood to an injured child in Badakhshan or to carry water to a family in Kandahar than to lean across and say sorry to his wife.

The small issues are really just large ones that haven’t been accorded the requisite attention.

“When you say you want a window open in the middle of winter, it scares and upsets me—emotionally rather than physically. It seems to me to speak of a future in which precious things will be trampled upon. It reminds me of a certain sadistic stoicism and cheerful bravery in you which I am generally in flight from. On some subconscious level, I feel afraid that it’s not really fresh air you want but that, instead, you’d ideally like to push me out of the window in your charming but brusque, sensible, daunting way.”.

“My insistence on leaving so early is in the end a symptom of fear. In a world of randomness and surprises, it’s a technique I’ve developed to ward off anxiety and an unholy, unnameable sense of dread. I want to be on time the same way others lust for power and from a similar drive for security; it makes a little sense, though only a little, in light of the fact that I spent my childhood waiting for a father who never showed up. It’s my own crazy way of trying to stay sane.”.

Over a single weekend they might spin from claustrophobia to admiration, desire to boredom, indifference to ecstasy, irritation to tenderness.

“Oh, come on!” she says, raising her voice to be heard. “At least tell me what’s going on.” To which he replies, “Fuck you, leave me alone.” Which is sometimes how fear can sound.

At the heart of a sulk lies a confusing mixture of intense anger and an equally intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about.

It is a privilege to be the recipient of a sulk; it means the other person respects and trusts us enough to think we should understand their unspoken hurt. It is one of the odder gifts of love.

Only when we don’t have to explain can we feel certain that we are genuinely understood.

Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, dangerous ideal that can be traced back to our earliest childhoods: the promise of wordless understanding. In the womb, we never had to explain. Our every requirement was catered to. The right sort of comfort simply happened. Some of this idyll continued in our first years. We didn’t have to make our every requirement known: large, kind people guessed for us. They saw past our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions: they found the explanations for discomforts which we lacked the ability to verbalize. That may be why, in relationships, even the most eloquent among us may instinctively prefer not to spell things out when our partners are at risk of failing to read us properly. Only wordless and accurate mind reading can feel like a true sign that our partner is someone to be trusted; only when we don’t have to explain can we feel certain that we are genuinely understood. When.

We do our sulking lovers the greatest possible favor when we are able to regard their tantrums as we would those of an infant. We are so alive to the idea that it’s patronizing to be thought of as younger than we are; we forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with—and forgive—the disappointed, furious, inarticulate child within.

Speaking up and volunteering one’s opinions were not standard practices among the Khans.

Rabih thereby grew up to understand the love of others as a reward for being good, not for being transparent.

Rabih thereby grew up to understand the love of others as a reward for being good, not for being transparent. As an adult and as a husband, he lacks any idea of how to make something coherent out of the nonnormative parts of himself. It is neither arrogance nor a sense that his wife has no right to know who he really is that makes him secretive and hesitant; rather, it is sheer terror that his tendencies towards self-loathing will be intensified to an unbearable degree by the presence of a witness.

Complete indifference. He has chosen love over libido.

Unfortunately, to admit that we may be drawing on the confusions of the past to force an interpretation onto what’s happening now seems humbling and not a little humiliating: Surely we know the difference between our partner and a disappointing parent, between a husband’s short delay and a father’s permanent abandonment; between some dirty laundry and a civil war?.

“Sorry to have interrupted you, Mrs. Khan. But I think I used to live here,” says Rabih. “Definitely not. You must be looking for 34A, and this is 34B, you see. . . .” “I think we once got married. Do you remember? That’s our child, Dobbie, over there in the corner. He’s very silent. Kind of like his mum.”.

Neither he nor she have to be perfect, he reflects; they only need to give each other the odd sign they know they can sometimes be quite hard to live with.

We don’t need to be constantly reasonable in order to have good relationships; all we need to have mastered is the occasional capacity to acknowledge with good grace that we may, in one or two areas, be somewhat insane.

The most superficially irrational, immature, lamentable, but nonetheless common of all the presumptions of love is that the person to whom we have pledged ourselves is not just the center of our emotional existence but is also, as a result—and yet in a very strange, objectively insane and profoundly unjust way—responsible for everything that happens to us, for good or ill. Therein lies the peculiar and sick privilege of love.

The world upsets, disappoints, frustrates, and hurts us in countless ways at every turn. It delays us, rejects our creative endeavors, overlooks us for promotions, rewards idiots, and smashes our ambitions on its bleak, relentless shoals. And almost invariably we can’t complain about any of it. It’s too difficult to tease out who may really be to blame—and too dangerous to complain even when we know for certain (lest we be fired or laughed at). There is only one person to whom we can expose our catalogue of grievances, one person who can be the recipient of all our accumulated rage at the injustices and imperfections of our lives. It is of course the height of absurdity to blame them. But this is to misunderstand the rules under which love operates. It is because we cannot scream at the forces who are really responsible that we get angry with those we are sure will best tolerate us for blaming them. We take it out on the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in the vicinity, the ones least likely to have harmed us, but the ones most likely to stick around while we pitilessly rant at them.

The accusations we make of our lovers make no particular sense. We would utter such unfair things to no one else on earth. But our wild charges are a peculiar proof of intimacy and trust, a symptom of love itself—and in their own way a perverted manifestation of commitment. Whereas we can say something sensible and polite to any stranger, it is only in the presence of the lover we wholeheartedly believe in that can we dare to be extravagantly and boundlessly unreasonable.

People who are planning to sack you should really have the decency and courage not also to want you to like them, reflects Rabih.

The very concept of trying to “teach” a lover things feels patronizing, incongruous, and plain sinister.

The very concept of trying to “teach” a lover things feels patronizing, incongruous, and plain sinister. If we truly loved someone, there could be no talk of wanting him or her to change.

It is this fundamental commitment to benevolence that makes the early months of love so moving.

And yet the best guarantee of calm in a teacher is a relative indifference to the success or failure of his or her lesson.

Maturity means acknowledging that Romantic love might only constitute a narrow and perhaps rather mean-minded aspect of emotional life, one principally focused on a quest to find love rather than to give it, to be loved rather than to love. Children may end up being the unexpected teachers of people many times their age, to whom they offer—through their exhaustive dependence, egoism, and vulnerability—an advanced education in a wholly new sort of love, one in which reciprocation is never jealously demanded or fractiously regretted and in which the true goal is nothing less than the transcendence of oneself for the sake of another.

As parents, we learn another thing about love: how much power we have over people who depend on us and, therefore, what responsibilities we have to tread carefully around those who have been placed at our mercy.

We learn of an unexpected capacity to hurt without meaning to: to frighten through eccentricity or unpredictability, anxiety or momentary irritation.

He finds it almost heartbreaking to remember that there is a place not far away from his office where people know how to care properly about one another and where a person’s tears and confusion, let alone lunch menu and sleeping position, can be of such deep concern to another human.

Anything can be a good starting point for curiosity when you haven’t yet got to the stifling stage of supposedly knowing where your interests lie.

It is a wonderful thing to live in a world where so many people are nice to children. It would be even better if we lived in one where we were a little nicer to the childlike sides of one another.

A person has to feel rather safe around someone else in order to be this difficult. Before a child can throw a tantrum, the background atmosphere needs to be profoundly benevolent.

The role of being a good parent brings with it one large and very tricky requirement: to be the constant bearer of deeply unfortunate news. The good parent must be the defender of a range of the child’s long-term interests, which are by nature entirely impossible for him or her to envisage, let alone assent to cheerfully. Out of love, parents must gird themselves to speak of clean teeth, homework, tidy rooms, bedtimes, generosity, and limits to computer usage. Out of love, they must adopt the guise of bores with a hateful and maddening habit of bringing up unwelcome facts about existence just when the fun is really starting. And, as a result of these subterranean loving acts, good parents must, if things have gone well, end up as the special targets of intense resentment and indignation.

“people whose suggestions I may go along with if—and only if—I see the point of what they’re saying.”.

It’s a strange thing indeed for Rabih, congenitally intent as he is on avoiding confrontation of any sort, to have to deliver such an apparently unloving message to someone he loves beyond measure.

Once, when Esther was four, she said to both her parents, with great seriousness, “I wish Mummy would die so I could marry Daddy.”.

She can see what a bewitching and glamorous figure Rabih could seem to someone under ten.

Parental kindness were enough, the human race would stagnate and in time die off. The survival of the species hinges on children eventually getting fed up and heading off into the world armed with hopes of finding more satisfying sources of excitement.

If parental kindness were enough, the human race would stagnate and in time die off. The survival of the species hinges on children eventually getting fed up and heading off into the world armed with hopes of finding more satisfying sources of excitement.

As Esther talks, William can be heard singing in the background, making a show of how uninterested he is in any father who has had the bad taste to leave him behind.

He is in love with a woman who too often appears not to need love at all; a fighter so capable and strong that there are few opportunities afforded to nurture her; someone with a problematic relationship to anyone inclined to help her, and who sometimes seems most comfortable when she feels disappointed by those to whom she has entrusted herself.

One generally has to care quite a lot about a partner to bother to betray them.

It makes him feel a little lonely to realize how easy it is to be liked by someone who has no idea who he is.

Otherwise it may seem that what we are dealing with is not really love at all but rather a kind of small-minded and hypocritical possessiveness, a desire to make one’s partner happy if, but only if, that happiness involves oneself.

Is there not, wonders Rabih, an infantile idealism in our wish to find everything in one other being—someone who will be simultaneously a best friend, a lover, a co-parent, a co-chauffeur, and a business partner? What a recipe for disappointment and resentment in this notion upon which millions of otherwise perfectly good marriages regularly founder.

He’s impelled to say the very worst things, to try to smash the relationship to see if it’s real and worth trusting.

Love isn’t like a cake: if you give love to one person, it doesn’t mean there is less for anyone.

But in order for love to keep going, it also seems impossible to imagine partners not learning to keep a great many of their thoughts to themselves.

No relationship could start without a commitment to wholehearted intimacy. But in order for love to keep going, it also seems impossible to imagine partners not learning to keep a great many of their thoughts to themselves.

The person who can’t tolerate secrets, who in the name of “being honest” shares information so wounding to the other that it can never be forgotten—this person is no friend of love. And if we suspect (as we should regularly if our relationship is a worthy one) that our partner is also lying (about what she’s thinking of, how he judges our work, where she was last night, etc.), then we would do well not to act the sharp and relentless inquisitor. It may be kinder, wiser, and closer to the true spirit of love to pretend we simply didn’t notice.

The truth risks distorting the relationship far more than the untruth.

For most of recorded history, people stayed married because they were keen to fit in with the expectations of society, had a few assets to protect, and wanted to maintain the unity of their families. Then gradually another, very different standard took hold: couples were to remain together, ran the thought, only so long as certain feelings still obtained between them—feelings of authentic enthusiasm, desire, and fulfillment. In this new Romantic order, spouses could be justified in parting ways if the marital routine had become deadening, if the children were getting on their nerves, if sex was no longer enticing, or if either party had lately been feeling a little unhappy.

The more Rabih appreciates how chaotic and directionless his feelings are, the more sympathetic he grows to the idea of marriage as an institution.

At a conference, he might spy an attractive woman and want to throw away everything for her sake, only to recognize two days later that he would prefer to be dead than without Kirsten. Or, during protracted rainy weekends, he might wish that his children might grow up and leave him alone until the end of time so he could read his magazine in peace—and then a day later, at the office, his heart would tighten with grief because a meeting threatened to overrun and get him home an hour too late to put the kids to bed.

The avoidant person for their part will speak of a need for “space,” will enjoy their own company, and will find requirements for sexual intimacy daunting at points.

Rabih anxiously attacks; Kirsten avoidantly withdraws.

They cannot offer each other that most romantically necessary of gifts: a guide to their own vulnerabilities.

1. “I want emotionally close relationships, but I find that other people are often disappointing or mean without good reason. I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others. I don’t mind spending time on my own.” (avoidant attachment).

2. “I want to be emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that they are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I worry that others don’t value me as much as I value them. It can make me feel very upset and annoyed.” (anxious attachment).

3. “It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I feel comfortable depending on others and having them depend on me. I don’t worry about being alone or not being accepted by others.” (secure attachment).

He is on track to die with the largest parts of his talent still unexploited, registering as mere flashes of inspiration that he occasionally perceives out of the corner of his mind’s eye while he’s in the shower or driving alone down the motorway.

This isn’t a midlife crisis; it’s more that he is finally, some thirty years too late, leaving adolescence behind.

He sees he is a man with an exaggerated longing for Romantic love who nevertheless understands little about kindness and even less about communication.

Rabih used to assume that only the flawless version of anything was worth having. He was a perfectionist. If the car was scratched, he couldn’t enjoy driving it; if the room was untidy, he couldn’t rest; if his lover didn’t understand parts of him, the entire relationship was a charade. Now “good enough” is becoming good enough.

He’s learnt, over many painful episodes, that his beautiful, intelligent wife doesn’t do reassurance.

But, better than that, he’s started to understand why. She isn’t mean; it’s her experience of men and her defenses against being let down kicking in. It’s just how she processes challenges. It helps to see these things; he is accruing alternatives to vengeance and anger.

Few in this world are ever simply nasty; those who hurt us are themselves in pain. The appropriate response is hence never cynicism nor aggression but, at the rare moments one can manage it, always love.

How could a parent ever truly approve? How could they possibly be expected, after eighteen or so years of answering to a child’s every need, to react enthusiastically to a new and competing source of love? How could anyone sincerely perform the requisite emotional somersault and not suspect in their heart—and let on as much, through a succession of more or less sour remarks—that their child had mistakenly fallen into the clutches of someone fundamentally unsuited to the complex and unique task of administering to them?.

Today’s so-called bad photograph will be next year’s good one. Nature’s kind trick is to make everything happen so slowly that we don’t get as scared as we should.

He is a collection of tissues and cells delicately and intricately conjoined and brought to life for only an instant. It will take just one sharp collision or a fall to render them inanimate again. All the seriousness of his plans depends on a steady flow of blood to his brain through a vulnerable network of capillaries. Should any of these suffer even the tiniest of failures, the tenuous sense he has begun to make of life will at once be erased. He is just a fortuitous constellation of atoms which have chosen to resist entropy for a few moments within cosmic eternity. He wonders which of his organs will fail first.

One evening, returning home through the dark streets, he spots a florist’s shop. He must have passed it many, many times, and yet he’s never taken any notice of it before. The front window is brightly illuminated and filled with a variety of blooms. He steps in, and an elderly woman smiles warmly at him. His eye is drawn to the first native flowers of a tentative spring: snowdrops. He watches the woman’s hands wrap the little bunch in fine white tissue. “For someone nice, I think?” She smiles at him. “My wife,” he replies. “Lucky woman,” she says as she hands him the bundle and his change. He hopes to get home and, on this occasion, prove the florist right.

It’s not the paradox it seems. Given that marriage yields its important lessons only to those who have enrolled in its curriculum, it’s normal that readiness should tend to follow rather than precede the ceremony itself, perhaps by a decade or two.

Choosing a person to marry is hence just a matter of deciding exactly what kind of suffering we want to endure rather than of assuming we have found a way to skirt the rules of emotional existence.

For this realization to sink in, it helps to have had a few lovers before settling down, not in order to have had a chance to locate “the right person,” but in order to have had an ample opportunity to discover at first hand, and in many different contexts, the truth that there isn’t any such a person; that everyone really is a bit wrong when considered from close up.

It’s everyone else who is out of step . . . and yet, maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness.

It’s profoundly counterintuitive for us to think of ourselves as mad. We seem so normal and mostly so good—to ourselves. It’s everyone else who is out of step . . . and yet, maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness.

Rabih is ready for marriage because he is prepared to love rather than be loved.

He is ready for marriage because (on a good day) he is happy to be taught and calm about teaching.

We are ready for marriage when we accept that, in a number of significant areas, our partner will be wiser, more reasonable, and more mature than we are.

“Sorry, Mr. Sfouf, that I haven’t always been who you wanted me to be.”.

And for a brief moment on the slopes of a Scottish mountain in the late-afternoon summer sun—and every now and then thereafter—Rabih Khan feels that he might, with Kirsten by his side, be strong enough for whatever life demands of him.


# Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Third Edition: The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping - Now Revised and Updated (Robert M. Sapolsky)

But the outcome will also depend heavily on such surprising factors as his personality, the amount of emotional stress he experiences over the years, whether he has someone’s shoulder to cry on when those stressors occur.

As part of updating the material for this third edition, I have added two new chapters: one on the interactions between stress and sleep, and one on what stress has to do with addiction.

Yet most of us are not incapacitated by stress-related disease. Instead, we cope, both physiologically and psychologically, and some of us are spectacularly successful at it.

I love science, and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means that you cannot also choose compassion, or the arts, or be awed by nature. Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but to reinvent and reinvigorate it.

There is a tradition among stress physiologists who dedicate their books to their spouses or significant others, an unwritten rule that you are supposed to incorporate something cutesy about stress in the dedication. So, to Madge, who attenuates my stressors; for Arturo, the source of my eustress; for my wife who, over the course of the last umpteen years, has put up with my stress-induced hypertension, ulcerative colitis, loss of libido, and displaced aggression. I will forgo that style in the actual dedication of this book to my wife, as I have something simpler to say.

The diseases that plague us now are ones of slow accumulation of damage—heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disorders.

This book is a primer about stress, stress-related disease, and the mechanisms of coping with stress. How is it that our bodies can adapt to some stressful emergencies, while other ones make us sick? Why are some of us especially vulnerable to stress-related diseases, and what does that have to do with our personalities?.

How many hippos worry about whether Social Security is going to last as long as they will, or what they are going to say on a first date? Viewed from the perspective of the evolution of the animal kingdom, sustained psychological stress is a recent invention, mostly limited to humans and other social primates.

For animals like zebras, the most upsetting things in life are acute physical crises.

An organism can also be plagued by chronic physical challenges.

Drought, famine, parasites, that sort of unpleasantness—not the sort of experience we have often, but central events in the lives of non-westernized humans and most other mammals.

Critical to this book is a third category of ways to get upset—psychological and social disruptions.

Chess grand masters, during their tournaments, can place metabolic demands on their bodies that begin to approach those of athletes during the peak of a competitive event.

We can experience wildly strong emotions (provoking our bodies into an accompanying uproar) linked to mere thoughts.

And if someone spends months on end twisting his innards in anxiety, anger, and tension over some emotional problem, this might very well lead to illness.

Ah, that dimly remembered concept, the idea that the body has an ideal level of oxygen that it needs, an ideal degree of acidity, an ideal temperature, and so on. All these different variables are maintained in homeostatic balance, the state in which all sorts of physiological measures are being kept at the optimal level. The brain, it has been noted, has evolved to seek homeostasis.

But when we get into a physiological uproar and activate the stress-response for no reason at all, or over something we cannot do anything about, we call it things like “anxiety,” “neurosis,” “paranoia,” or “needless hostility.”.

Homeostasis is about tinkering with this valve or that gizmo. Allostasis is about the brain coordinating body-wide changes, often including changes in behavior.

One of the hallmarks of the stress-response is the rapid mobilization of energy from storage sites and the inhibition of further storage.

You have better things to do than digest breakfast when you are trying to avoid being someone’s lunch.

During stress, growth and tissue repair is curtailed, sexual drive decreases in both sexes; females are less likely to ovulate or to carry pregnancies to term, while males begin to have trouble with erections and secrete less testosterone.

If you constantly mobilize energy at the cost of energy storage, you will never store any surplus energy. You will fatigue more rapidly, and your risk of developing a form of diabetes will even increase.

But if you constantly try to balance a seesaw with two elephants instead of two little kids, all sorts of problems will emerge:.

The half of the autonomic nervous system that is turned on is called the sympathetic nervous system.

The sympathetic nervous system kicks into action during emergencies, or what you think are emergencies. It helps mediate vigilance, arousal, activation, mobilization. To generations of first-year medical students, it is described through the obligatory lame joke about the sympathetic nervous system mediating the four F’s of behavior—flight, fight, fright, and sex.

If a neuron (a cell of the nervous system) secretes a chemical messenger that travels a thousandth of an inch and causes the next cell in line (typically, another neuron) to do something different, that messenger is called a neurotransmitter.

This realization gave rise to the memorable cliché that the pituitary is the master gland of the body.

The other, less polished but more honest, said the competition was all that drove him for decades and described his relationship with his co-winner as “many years of vicious attacks and bitter retaliation.”.

(Are you overwhelmed and intimidated by these terms, wondering if you should have bought some Deepak Chopra self-help book instead? Please, don’t even dream of memorizing these names of hormones. The important ones are going to appear so regularly in the coming pages that you will soon be comfortably and accurately slipping them into everyday conversation and birthday cards to favorite cousins. Trust me.).

By the end of this book you will be astonishingly informed about glucocorticoid trivia, since I am in love with these hormones.

Taylor argues convincingly that the physiology of the stress-response can be quite different in females, built around the fact that in most species, females are typically less aggressive than males, and that having dependent young often precludes the option of flight.

Moreover, oxytocin may be critical for a female to form a monogamous pair bond with a male (in the relatively few mammalian species that are monogamous).

For example, while stress causes a prompt decline in the secretion of growth hormone in rats, it causes a transient increase in growth hormone secretion in humans (this puzzle and its implication for humans are discussed in the chapter on growth).

A question no doubt at the forefront of every reader’s mind at this point: if one of the features of the cardiovascular stress-response is to conserve water in the circulation, and this is accomplished by inhibition of urine formation in the kidneys, why is it that when we are really terrified, we wet our pants?.

Basically, your heart is just a dumb, simple mechanical pump, and your blood vessels are nothing more exciting than hoses. The cardiovascular stress-response essentially consists of making them work harder for a while, and if you do that on a regular basis, they will wear out, just like any pump or hose you’d buy at Sears.

In the last few years, it is becoming clear that the amount of damaged, inflamed blood vessels is a better predictor of cardiovascular trouble than is the amount of circulating crud.

Means that your legs and chest hurt like hell for lack of oxygen and glucose whenever you walk; you are then a candidate for bypass surgery.

(reminding one of the oft-quoted statement by Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate writer and Holocaust survivor: “The opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of love is indifference.”).

This is the case among people in non-westernized populations. The disease is not, therefore, a normal feature of aging; instead, it is a disease of inactivity and fat surplus, conditions that just happen to be more common with age in some societies.).

Congratulations, you now have a “functional” GI disorder.

An ulcer is a hole in the wall of an organ, and ulcers originating in the stomach or in the organs immediately bordering it are termed peptic ulcers.

Clinicians celebrated at never having again to sit down with their ulcer patients, make some serious eye contact, and ask them how their lives were going.

There’s nothing like parenthood to make you really neurotic, as you worry about the consequences of your every act, thought, or omission.

You only want perfection for the ones you love beyond words, so you get nutsy at times.

What is childhood about? It is a time when you make assessments about the nature of the world.

“If something is hidden underneath something else, it still exists.”.

“Even if Mommy disappears for a while, she will come back because Mommy always comes back.”.

I will suggest that this arises from having learned at a premature age a deep emotional lesson about the nature of life, namely, that this is a world in which awful things can happen over which you have no control.

Consider a female who is pregnant during a famine. She’s not getting enough calories, nor is her fetus. It turns out that during the latter part of pregnancy, a fetus is “learning” about how plentiful food is in that outside world, and a famine winds up “teaching” it that, jeez, there’s not a whole lot of food out there, better store every smidgen of it. Something about the metabolism of that fetus shifts permanently, a feature called metabolic “imprinting” or “programming.” Forever after, that fetus will be particularly good at storing the food it consumes, at retaining every grain of precious salt from the diet. Forever after, that fetus develops what has been termed a “thrifty” metabolism.

Everything else being equal throughout life, even late in life, that organism is more at risk for hypertension, obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Fetal Origins of Adult Disease.

And then the chapter informs us that the boy became the author of the much-beloved children’s classic—Peter Pan. J. M. Barrie’s writings are filled with children who didn’t grow up, who were fortunate enough to die in childhood, who came back as ghosts to visit their mothers.

To take a concrete, nuts and bolts feature of growth, the rate at which this child was depositing calcium in his long bones could be successfully predicted by his proximity to a loved one.

You can’t ask for a clearer demonstration that what is going on in our heads influences every cell in our bodies.

Sometimes a stressor can be the failure to provide something essential, and the absence of touch is seemingly one of the most marked developmental stressors that we can suffer.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet. In a particular culture, how often is a child typically held by parents, by non-parents? Do babies sleep alone ever and, if so, starting at what age? What is the average length of time that a child cries in a particular culture before she is picked up and comforted?.

Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

An infant human or animal can be well fed, maintained at an adequate temperature, peered at nervously, and ministered to by the best of neonatologists, yet still not thrive. Something is still missing. Perhaps we can even risk scientific credibility and detachment and mention the word love here, because that most ephemeral of phenomena lurks between the lines of this chapter. Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

All the experts believed that affection not only wasn’t needed for development but was a squishy, messy thing that kept kids from becoming upright, independent citizens. Yet young organisms were able to teach about how these savants were wrong in a classic set of studies begun in the 1950s—studies that are, in my opinion, among the most haunting and troubling of all the pages of science.

Kids don’t love their mothers because Mom balances their nutritive intake, these results suggested. They love them because, usually, Mom loves them back, or at least is someone soft to cling to. “Man cannot live by milk alone. Love is an emotion that does not need to be bottle- or spoon-fed,” wrote Harlow.

They have taught us the science of why we primates love individuals who treat us badly, why the mistreatment can at times increase the love. They have taught us about why being abused as a child increases the risk of your being an abusive adult.

The Stress of My Life.

Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

As will be discussed in chapter 9, endorphins play a role in blocking pain perception and are secreted in response to exercise (helping to account for the famed “runner’s high” or “endorphin high” that hits many hardy joggers around the 30-minute mark).

Getting an erection to work properly is so incredibly complicated physiologically that if men ever actually had to understand it, none of us would be here.

This is accomplished by activating his parasympathetic nervous system. In other words, the guy has to be calm, vegetative, relaxed.

(Incredibly complicated choreography between these two systems; don’t try this unsupervised.).

This new understanding generates tricks that sexual therapists advise—if you are close to ejaculating and don’t want to yet, take a deep breath. Expanding the chest muscles briefly triggers a parasympathetic volley that defers the shift from parasympathetic to sympathetic.

Turns out that they are fabulous hunters. And you know what happens? Lions, who are not particularly effective hunters, because they are big and slow and conspicuous, spend most of their time keying in on hyenas and ripping off their kills. No wonder when it’s dawn on the savanna the hyenas on the periphery are looking cranky, with circles under their eyes. They stayed up all night hunting that thing, and who’s having breakfast now?.

This hasn’t yet been demonstrated, but perhaps Berkeley scientists working on this, squandering tax dollars that could otherwise be going to Halliburton and Bechtel, will do.

An enzyme in the fat cells of females usually eliminates these androgens by converting them to estrogens.

There is a small amount of male sex hormone in the bloodstream of females, even non-hyena females.

In human beings, this doesn’t come from the ovaries (as in the hyenas), but from the adrenals. The amount of these “adrenal androgens” is only about 5 percent of that in males, but enough to cause trouble.*.

Scientists have called them the original affluent society.

Instead, they typically act for the good of their own genetic legacy and that of their close relatives.

The evidence for the brain’s influence on the immune system goes back at least a century, dating to the first demonstration that if you waved an artificial rose in front of someone who is highly allergic to roses (and who didn’t know it was a fake), they’d get an allergic response.

Such immune defenses are brought about by a complex array of circulating cells called lymphocytes and monocytes (which are collectively known as white blood cells; cyte is a term for cells).

What the data show: the fewer social relationships a person has, the shorter his or her life expectancy, and the worse the impact of various infectious diseases.

For the same illness, people with the fewest social connections have approximately two-and-a-half times as much chance of dying as those with the most connections, after controlling for such variables as age, gender, and health status.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced. In other words, this stressor is associated with increased mortality in the subset of parents with the added risk factor of minimal social support.

In searching for a link between stress and increased risk of cancer, it may not be surprising to find that women who have spent long periods (decades in these studies) working night shifts have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, the most plausible explanation here has nothing to do with stress. Instead, a shifted day/night schedule dramatically decreases the level of a light-responsive hormone called melatonin, and depletion of this hormone greatly increases the risk of a number of types of cancer, including breast cancer.

Love, Medicine and Miracles.

As the book unfolds, you note that it is a strange world that Siegel inhabits. When operating on anesthetized patients, “I also do not hesitate to ask the [anesthetized] patient not to bleed if circumstances call for it,” he asserts. In his world, deceased patients come back as birds, there are unnamed countries in which individuals consistently live for a century, and best of all, people who have the right spirituality not only successfully fight cancer but can drive cars that consistently break down for other people.

“I feel that all disease is ultimately related to a lack of love”.

Obviously, a theme of this book is just how many things can go wrong in the body because of stress and how important it is for everyone to recognize this.

Now, like an aging Cretaceous dinosaur, I watch these new mammals proliferating.

“how big is a normal thymus?”.

Perhaps the best moral is that when doing science (or perhaps when doing anything at all in a society as judgmental as our own), be very careful and very certain before pronouncing something to be the norm—because at that instant, you have made it supremely difficult to ever again look objectively at an exception to that supposed norm.

However, it turns out that while Yossarian merely does not believe in the existence of a God and is rather angry about the whole concept, the God that she does not believe in is one who is good and warm and loving, and thus she is offended by the.

“How much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?” “Pain?” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. “Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.” “And who created the dangers?” Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. “Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! Why couldn’t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of his celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person’s forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn’t He?” “People would certainly look silly walking around with red neon tubes in the middle of their foreheads.” “They certainly look beautiful now writhing in agony or stupefied with morphine, don’t they?” Unfortunately, we lack neon lights in the middle of our foreheads, and in the absence of such innocuous signs, we probably do need pain perception. Pain can hurt like hell, but it can inform us that we are sitting too close to the fire, or that we should never again eat the novel item that just gave us food poisoning. It effectively discourages us from trying to walk on an injured limb that is better left immobilized until it heals. And in our westernized lives, it is often a good signal that we had better see a doctor before it is too late. People who congenitally lack the ability to feel pain (a condition known as pain asymbolia) are a mess; because they can’t feel pain when they step down with too much force, their feet may ulcerate, their knee joints may disintegrate, and their long bones may crack; they burn themselves unawares; in some cases, they even lose a toe without knowing it. Pain is useful to the extent that it motivates us to modify our behaviors in order to reduce whatever insult is causing the pain, because invariably that insult is damaging our tissues. Pain is useless and debilitating, however, when it is telling us that there is something dreadfully wrong that we can do nothing about. We must praise the fact that we have evolved a physiological system that lets us know when our stomachs are empty. Yet at the same time we must deeply rue our evolving physiological system that can wrack a terminal cancer patient with unrelenting pain. Pain, until we get the lights on our foreheads, will remain a necessary but highly problematic part of our natural physiology. What is surprising is how malleable pain signals are—how readily the intensity of a pain signal is changed by the sensations, feelings, and thoughts that coincide with the pain. One example of this modulation, the blunting of pain perception during some circumstances of stress, is the subject of this chapter.   The Basics of Pain Perception   The sensation of pain originates in receptors located throughout our body. Some are deep within the body, telling us about muscle aches, fluid-filled, swollen joints, or damage to organs. Or even something as mundane as a distended bladder. Others, in our skin, can tell us that we have been cut, burned, abraded, poked, or compressed.* Often, these skin receptors respond to the signal of local tissue damage. Cut yourself with a paring knife, and you will slice open various cells of microscopic size that then spill out their proverbial guts; and, typically, within this cellular soup now flooding out of the area of injury is a variety of chemical messengers.

It turned out that patients who had views of trees from their windows requested significantly less pain medication than those who looked out on blank walls.

Here’s an example that will finally make reading this book worth your while—how to make neurobiology work to your competitive advantage at sports. You’re playing tennis against someone who is beating the pants off of you. Wait until your adversary has pulled off some amazing backhand, then offer a warm smile and say, “You are a fabulous tennis player. I mean it; you’re terrific. Look at that shot you just made. How did you do that? When you do a backhand like that, do you hold your thumb this way or that, and what about your other fingers? And how about your butt, do you scrunch up the left side of it and put your weight on your right toes, or the other way around?” Do it right, and the next time that shot is called for, your opponent/victim will make the mistake of thinking about it explicitly, and the stroke won’t be anywhere near as effective. As Yogi Berra once said, “You can’t think and hit at the same time.” Imagine descending a flight of stairs in an explicit manner, something you haven’t done since you were two years old—okay, bend my left knee and roll the weight of my toes forward while shifting my right hip up slightly—and down you go down the stairs.

As a result, the study of “adult neurogenesis” is now, arguably, the hottest topic in neuroscience.

Woody Allen once said, “My brain is my second-favorite organ.” My guess is that most of us would rank our brains even higher up on a list.

“We can’t do this, we’re going to die, I’m serious, people DIE from lack of sleep, it’s not possible to do this, it’s physiologically proven, we’re all going to DIE.”.

Not getting enough sleep is a stressor; being stressed makes it harder to sleep. Yup, we’ve got a dread vicious cycle on our hands.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional. You breathe underwater, fly in the air, communicate telepathically; you announce your love to strangers, invent languages, rule kingdoms, star in Busby Berkeley musicals.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain. Weirdly, another major reason to sleep is to dream. If you skip a night’s sleep, when you finally get to sleep the next night, you have more REM sleep than normal, suggesting that you’ve built up a real deficit of dreaming.

Both slow wave and REM sleep also seem to play roles in the formation of new memories, the consolidation of information from the previous day, even information that became less accessible to you while awake over the course of the day. One type of evidence supporting this is the fact that if you teach an animal some task and disrupt its sleep that night, the new information isn’t consolidated.

Being exposed to lots of new information during the day is associated with more REM sleep that night.

For example, lots of REM sleep during the night predicts better consolidation of emotional information from the day before, while lots of stage 2 sleep predicts better consolidation of a motor task, and a combination of lots of REM and slow wave sleep predicts better retention of perceptual information.

In 1910, the average American slept nine hours a night, disturbed only by the occasional Model T backfiring. We now average 7.5 and declining. When there’s the lure of 24-hour-a-day fun, activities, and entertainment or, for the workaholic, the knowledge that somewhere, in some time zone, someone else is working while you indulge yourself in sleep, that pull of “just a few more minutes,” of pushing yourself, becomes irresistible. And damaging.

Just when we finally grow up and learn to like ourselves and to love and play, the shadows lengthen. There is so little time.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves. There are types of cognitive skills that improve in old age (these are related to social intelligence and to making good strategic use of facts, rather than merely remembering them easily).

If you want to degenerate very fast, secrete a ton of glucocorticoids.

Live—if you squander a lot of your heartbeats being nervous about blind dates when you’re sixteen, there would be that much less metabolic reserve available to you at eighty.

But this time, when the painful stimulus occurs, the organism under study can reach out for its mommy and cry in her arms. Under these circumstances, this organism shows less of a stress-response.

We humans also deal better with stressors when we have outlets for frustration—punch a wall, take a run, find solace in a hobby. We are even cerebral enough to imagine those outlets and derive some relief: consider the prisoner of war who spends hours imagining a golf game in tremendous detail. I have a friend who passed a prolonged and very stressful illness lying in bed with a mechanical pencil and a notepad, drawing topographic maps of imaginary mountain ranges and taking hikes through them.

It’s a real primate specialty as well. A male baboon loses a fight. Frustrated, he spins around and attacks a subordinate male who was minding his own business.

“He’s one of those guys who doesn’t get ulcers, he gives them.”.

Social support networks—it helps to have a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, an ear to listen to you, someone to cradle you and to tell you it will be okay.

In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular stress-response.

Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher glucocorticoid levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting cortisol levels.

As noted in chapter 8, people with spouses or close friends have longer life expectancies.

If you are a member of an ethnic minority, the fewer members there are of your group in your neighborhood, the higher your risks of mental illness, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide..

The instant the second burst of drilling ends, down goes blood pressure. By being given news about the stressor to come, you are also implicitly being comforted by now knowing what stressors are not coming.

It’s that the temperature in the tropics is 20 degrees colder than anticipated.

Among other reasons, we wish to optimize our coping strategies when we request the most devastating piece of medical information any of us will ever face: “How much time do I have left?”.

Thus, the exercise of control is not critical; rather, it is the belief that you have it.

An everyday example: airplanes are safer than cars, yet more of us are phobic about flying. Why? Because your average driver believes that he is a better-than-average driver, thus more in control. In an airplane, we have no control at all. My wife and I tease each other on plane flights, exchanging control: “Okay, you rest for a while, I’ll take over concentrating on keeping the pilot from having a stroke.”.

Amazingly, the same is seen in a rat—let a rat run voluntarily in a running wheel, and it makes it feel great. Force a rat to do the same amount of exercise and it gets a massive stress-response.

Endless studies have shown that the link between occupational stress and increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is anchored in the killer combination of high demand and low control—you have to work hard, a lot is expected of you, and you have minimal control over the process.

The control element is more powerful than the demand one—low demand and low control is more damaging to one’s health than high demand and high control.

For example, it was only in recent years that orchestra unions won the right for regularly scheduled bathroom breaks during rehearsals, instead of having to wait until the conductor cared to note how squirmy the reed players had become.*.

Being subject to a random act of kindness.

An inappropriate sense of control in the face of awful events can make us feel terrible. Some of our most compassionate words to people experiencing tragedy involve minimizing their perceived sense of control. “It’s not your fault, no one could have stopped in time; she just darted out from between the cars.”.

“If they’d only made the effort to assimilate, they wouldn’t have these problems” (minorities have the power to prevent their persecution).

People with a strong internal locus of control (in other words, people who think they are the masters of their own ship—that what goes on around them reflects their actions) have far greater stress-responses than do those with external loci when confronted with something uncontrollable.

In the next two chapters we will consider psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and personality disorders, in which there’s a bad match between how stressful the real world is and how stressful the person perceives it to be.

Progeria, idiot savants with autism, cannibals with kuru.

Its incidence has been steadily increasing for decades—by the year 2020, depression is projected to be the second leading cause of medical disability on earth.

The defining feature of a major depression is loss of pleasure. If I had to define a major depression in a single sentence, I would describe it as a “genetic/neurochemical disorder requiring a strong environmental trigger whose characteristic manifestation is an inability to appreciate sunsets.”.

None of us will live forever, and on occasion we actually believe it; our days are filled with disappointments, failures, unrequited loves.

This trait is called anhedonia: hedonism is “the pursuit of pleasure,” anhedonia is “the inability to feel pleasure” (also often called dysphoria—I’ll be using the terms interchangeably).

There can be complex layers of these feelings: not just obsessive guilt, for example, about something that has contributed to the depression, but obsessive guilt about the depression itself—what it has done to the sufferer’s family, the guilt of not being able to overcome depression, a life lived but once and wasted amid this disease. Small wonder that, worldwide, depression accounts for 800,000 suicides per year.

An additional vegetative symptom is extremely relevant to this chapter, namely that major depressives often experience elevated levels of glucocorticoids.

In one variant, unipolar depression, the sufferer fluctuates from feeling extremely depressed to feeling reasonably normal.

In another form, the person fluctuates between deep depression and wild, disorganized hyperactivity. This is called bipolar depression or, more familiarly, manic depression.

Or we could describe someone as being in a manic state when he is buoyed by some unexpected good news—talking quickly, laughing, gesticulating.

The best evidence suggests that depression involves abnormal levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.

In one part of the body (the heart, for example), norepinephrine is a messenger concerning arousal and the Four F’s, while in a different part of the nervous system, norepinephrine seems to have something to do with the symptoms of depression.

The best evidence is that most of the drugs that lessen depression increase the amount of signaling by these neurotransmitters.

As mammals, we have large limbic systems; lizards have relatively tiny limbic systems—they are not noted for the complexity of their emotional lives.

Above that is the cortex. Everyone in the animal kingdom has some, but it is a real primate specialty. The cortex does abstract cognition, invents philosophy, remembers where your car keys are. The stuff of the previous chapter.

On an incredibly simplistic level, you can think of depression as occurring when your cortex thinks an abstract negative thought and manages to convince the rest of the brain that this is as real as a physical stressor.

Thus, an astonishingly crude prediction: cut the connections between the cortex and the rest of a depressive’s brain, and the cortex will no longer be able to get the rest of the brain depressed.

And the emotions that the ACC is involved in seem to be negative ones. Induce a positive state in someone by showing something amusing, and ACC metabolism decreases. In contrast, if you electrically stimulate the ACC in people, they feel a shapeless sense of fear and foreboding.

Specifically, activation of the left PFC is associated with positive moods, and activation of the right PFC, with negative.

Thus, not surprisingly, in depressives, there is decreased left PFC activity and elevated activity in the right PFC.

To begin, people who secrete too little thyroid hormone can develop major depressions and, when depressed, can be atypically resistant to antidepressant drugs working.

When something upsetting happens, women are more likely to ruminate over it—think about it or want to talk about it with someone else. And men, terrible communicators that they so often are, are more likely to want to think about anything but the problem, or even better, go and do something—exercise, use power tools, get drunk, start a war. A ruminative tendency, the cognitive psychologists argue, makes you more likely to become depressed.

Share every single gene with someone who is depressive and you still have a 50 percent chance of not having the disease.

Genes are rarely about inevitability, especially when it comes to humans, the brain, or behavior. They’re about vulnerability, propensities, tendencies.

But the key thing is that having version X of this gene Z doesn’t guarantee you get depression, it just increases your risk. And, in fact, knowing nothing more about someone than which version of gene Z she has doesn’t increase your odds of predicting whether she gets depressed. Version X increases depression risk only when coupled with a history of repeated major stressors.

In the case of a major melancholic depression, you have become obsessed with the ambivalence—the simultaneity, the irreconcilable nature of the intense love alongside the intense hatred.

Melancholia—a major depression—Freud theorized, is the internal conflict generated by this ambivalence.

“If only I had said the things I needed to, if only we could have worked things out”—for all of time, you have lost the chance to purge yourself of the ambivalence. For the rest of your life, you will be reaching for the door to let you into a place of pure, unsullied love, and you can never reach that door.

“Face it. We suffer from learned cooking helplessness.”.

If a teacher at a critical point of our education, or a loved one at a critical point of our emotional development, frequently exposes us to his or her own specialized uncontrollable stressors, we may grow up with distorted beliefs about what we cannot learn or ways in which we are unlikely to be loved.

Times were good enough that he wasn’t going to starve, and he had reached the realization that there were things in life more important than fighting your way up the hierarchy.

He has a best friend in their mother, Barbara, and never gives a thought to what he’s turned his back on.

We are ecologically buffered and privileged enough to be stressed mainly over social and psychological matters.

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood.

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome.

I will attempt to do that reframing below. Instead, they characterized Type-A people as immensely competitive, overachieving, time-pressured, impatient, and hostile. People with that profile, they reported, had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Their work suggested that a persistent sense of insecurity is, in fact, a better predictor of cardiovascular profiles than is hostility, although theirs appears to be a minority view in the field.

In support of that, experimental studies show that the full expression of anger is a powerful stimulant of the cardiovascular system.

By contrast, in the reanalysis of the original Type-A data a particularly powerful predictor of heart disease was not only high degrees of hostility, but also the tendency not to express it when angry.

Run them through the blood and guts, and, with them gripping the arms of their chairs and trying to remain stoic, and still, the sympathetic activation becomes even greater. Repressing the expression of strong emotions appears to exaggerate the intensity of the physiology that goes along with them.

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s.

They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s. They describe themselves as planners who don’t like surprises, who live structured, rule-bound lives—walking to work the same way each day, always wearing the same style of clothes—the sort of people who can tell you what they’re having for lunch two weeks from Wednesday. Not surprisingly, they don’t like ambiguity and strive to set up their world in black and white, filled with good or bad people, behaviors that are permitted or strictly forbidden. They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

A lesson of repressive personality types and their invisible burdens is that, sometimes, it can be enormously stressful to construct a world without stressors.

If the context is one in which that special someone is likely to eventually say yes, her running hot and cold is all that’s needed to start you off on a fifty-year courtship.

Glucocorticoids, those hormones which have been discovered at the scene of the crime for virtually all the stress-related pathology we’ve been learning about, those same villainous glucocorticoids…will trigger the release of dopamine from pleasure pathways.

These are the folks who push every envelope. They spend every last dollar in Monopoly, have furtive sex in public places, try out a new, complicated recipe on important dinner guests, answer the ad in Soldier of Fortune. What’s up with them?.

Food for a hungry rat, sex for a horny one, and dopamine levels rise 50 to 100 percent in this pathway. But give the rat some cocaine and there is a THOUSAND-FOLD increase in dopamine release.

If someone always yells at you, you stop listening. If you flood a synapse with a gazillion times more of a neurotransmitter than is usually the case, the recipient neuron has to compensate by becoming less sensitive.

This is the addictive cycle of escalating drug use.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels. It’s about the motivation to avoid the punishment of not having the drug.

No wonder you feel so awful. Brain-imaging studies of drug users at that stage show that viewing a film of actors pretending to use drugs activates dopamine pathways in the brain more than does watching porn films.

As goes one of the clichés of addiction, there’s really no such thing as an ex-addict—it is simply an addict who is not in the context that triggers use.

The premise of this book is that we humans, especially we westernized humans, have come up with some pretty strange sources of negative emotions—worrying about and being saddened by purely psychological events that are displaced over space and time. But we westernized humans have also come up with some strange sources of positive emotions.

If we were nothing but machines of local homeostatic regulation, as we consume more, we would desire less.

Caveat—when I discuss a way in which stress can make you sick, that is merely shorthand for discussing how stress can make you more likely to get diseases that make you sick.

At the other extreme are the folks anchored in mind-body issues, for whom poor health is about psychological stress, lack of control and efficacy, and so on.

And it has come in the form of criticizing the extremes of both camps: on the one hand, trying to make clear how limiting it is to believe that humans can ever be reduced to a DNA sequence, and on the other, trying to indicate the damaging idiocy of denying the realities of human physiology and disease.

That disease, even the most reductive of diseases, cannot be appreciated without considering the person who is ill.

If we can’t consider disease outside the context of the person who is ill, we also can’t consider it outside the context of the society in which that person has gotten ill, and that person’s place in that society.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,”.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,” he wrote. And, “Physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor.”.

Resources, no matter how plentiful, are rarely divvied up evenly.

You spend hours sweet-talking someone into grooming you, getting rid of those bothersome thorns and nettles and parasites in your hair, and the grooming session can be broken up by someone dominant just for the sheer pleasure of hassling you. Or you could be sitting there, minding your own business, bird-watching, and some high-ranking guy having a bad day decides to make you pay for it by slashing you with his canines.

The answer, overwhelmingly, is that rank emerges first, and drives the distinctive stress profile.

Social subordination equals being chronically stressed equals an overactive stress-response equals more stress-related disease.

Some people always get more of their share of equality than others.

Where people in the community would stop kids from vandalizing a car even if they don’t know whose car it is.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality. In contrast, hierarchy is about domination, not symmetry and equality.

To figure this out, you need some fancy statistical techniques called path analysis.

One more grim example of how this works. America: enormous wealth, enormous income inequality, high crime, the most heavily armed nation on earth. And markedly low levels of social capital—it is virtually the constitutional right of an American to be mobile and anonymous. Show your independence. Move across the country for any job opportunity. (He lives across the street from his parents? Isn’t that a little, er, stunted?) Get a new accent, get a new culture, get a new name, unlist your phone number, reboot your life. All of which are the antitheses of developing social capital. This helps to explain something subtle about the health-income inequality relationship.

Our American credo is that people are willing to tolerate a society with miserably low levels of social capital, so long as there can be massive income inequality…with the hope that they will soon be sitting at the top of this steep pyramid.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight.

Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight. Agriculture allowed for the stockpiling of surplus resources and thus, inevitably, the unequal stockpiling of them—stratification of society and the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think that the punch line of the primate-human difference is that when humans invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low-ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.

Their simple, empowering, liberating message: if manipulating such psychological variables can work in these trying circumstances, it certainly should for the more trivial psychological stressors that fill our daily lives.

It is critical that one not walk away with the conclusion that in order to manage and minimize psychological stressors, the solution is always to have more of a sense of control, more predictability, more outlets, more social affiliation. These principles of stress management work only in certain circumstances. And only for certain types of people with certain types of problems.

Despite the endless ways in which stress can disrupt, we do not all collapse into puddles of stress-related disease and psychiatric dysfunction.

Animals of many different species show some version of giving up on life in the face of something aversive and out of their control.

When it comes to humans who wish to cope with stress and achieve successful aging, you should be sure to pick the right parents’ genes, and the right parents’ socioeconomic status as well.

What if we happen not to be the sort of baboon who looks at the bright side, the person who holds on to hope when others become hopeless, the parent of the child with cancer who somehow psychologically manages the unmanageable?.

As the most obvious example, physical conditioning brought about by regular exercise will lower blood pressure and resting heart rate and increase lung capacity, just to mention a few of its effects.

Among Type-A people, psychotherapy can change not only behaviors but also cholesterol profiles, risk of heart attack, and risk of dying, independent of changes in diet or other physiological regulators of cholesterol. As another example, the pain and stressfulness of childbirth can be modulated by relaxation techniques such as Lamaze.

Exercise is great to counter stress for a number of reasons. First, it decreases your risk of various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and therefore decreases the opportunity for stress to worsen those diseases.

For that reason, I think it would be helpful to put my cards on the table before tackling this subject. I had a highly orthodox religious upbringing and believed devoutly. Except that now I am an atheist, have no room in my life for spirituality of any kind, and believe that religion is phenomenally damaging. Except that I wish I could be religious. Except that it makes no sense to me and I’m baffled by people who believe. Except that I’m also moved by them. So I’m confused. On to the science.

For example, an endless source of tension in heterosexual relationships is that women, on average, tend toward emotion- or relationship-based coping styles, whereas men tend toward problem-solving approaches.

As an idiotic example, suppose there’s a big exam looming. One version of coping with it is to study; another is to reframe the meaning of a bad grade (“There’s more to life than this class, I’m still a good person who is good at other things…”). Obviously before the exam, the stress-reduction-by-studying strategy should dominate, while you should hold off on the stress-reduction-by-reframing approach until after the exam.

80 percent of the stress reduction is accomplished with the first 20 percent of effort. What.

For example, clinically depressed people feel significantly better simply by scheduling a first appointment to see a therapist—it means they’ve recognized there’s a problem, it means they’ve fought their way up through the psychomotor quagmire to actually do something, it means they’ve turned a corner.

Love has a history and we ride – sometimes rather helplessly – on its currents.


# On China (Henry Kissinger)

The American motive for the opening was to put before our people a vision of peace transcending the travail of the Vietnam War and the ominous vistas of the Cold War.

This book is an effort, based in part on conversations with Chinese leaders, to explain the conceptual way the Chinese think about problems of peace and war and international order, and its relationship to the more pragmatic, case-by-case American approach.

The first war had occurred over 1,300 years earlier, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when China dispatched troops to support an Indian kingdom against an illegitimate and aggressive rival. After China’s intervention, the two countries had enjoyed centuries of flourishing religious and economic exchange. The lesson learned from the ancient campaign, as Mao described it, was that China and India were not doomed to perpetual enmity.

Weeks later the offensive proceeded much as he described: China executed a sudden, devastating blow on the Indian positions and then retreated to the previous line of control, even going so far as to return the captured Indian heavy weaponry.

While other countries were named after ethnic groups or geographical landmarks, China called itself zhongguo—the “Middle Kingdom” or the “Central Country.” 2 Any attempt to understand China’s twentieth-century diplomacy or its twenty-first-century world role must begin—even at the cost of some potential oversimplification—with a basic appreciation of the traditional context.

Chinese today can understand inscriptions written in the age of Confucius; contemporary Chinese books and conversations are enriched by centuries-old aphorisms citing ancient battles and court intrigues.

The famous opening of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a fourteenth-century epic novel treasured by centuries of Chinese (including Mao, who is said to have pored over it almost obsessively in his youth), evokes this continuous rhythm: “The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.”3.

No Chinese leader ever articulated a rationale for why China would want to control the Japanese archipelago.

The borders between China and the surrounding peoples were not so much political and territorial demarcations as cultural differentiations.

“civilization pretending to be a nation-state.”.

As late as 1820, it produced over 30 percent of world GDP—an amount exceeding the GDP of Western.

Almost all empires were created by force, but none can be sustained by it.

Almost all empires were created by force, but none can be sustained by it. Universal rule, to last, needs to translate force into obligation. Otherwise, the energies of the rulers will be exhausted in maintaining their dominance at the expense of their ability to shape the future, which is the ultimate task of statesmanship. Empires persist if repression gives way to consensus.

Not the least exceptional aspect of Chinese culture is that these values were essentially secular in nature. At the time when Buddhism appeared in Indian culture stressing contemplation and inner peace, and monotheism was proclaimed by the Jewish—and, later, Christian and Islamic—prophets with an evocation of a life after death, China produced no religious themes in the Western sense at all. The Chinese never generated a myth of cosmic creation. Their universe was created by the Chinese themselves, whose values, even when declared of universal applicability, were conceived of as Chinese in origin.

[l]ove of kindness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by foolishness. Love of knowledge, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by loose speculation. Love of honesty, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by harmful candour. Love of straightforwardness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by misdirected judgment. Love of daring, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by insubordination. And love for strength of character, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by intractability.

‘those who come modestly are sent off generously.’”.

China did not export its ideas but let others come to seek them.

What was most remarkable about the Chinese approach to international affairs was less its monumental formal pretensions than its underlying strategic acumen and longevity.

The highest aspiration was less to conquer (though China occasionally mounted major military campaigns) than to deter invasion and prevent the formation of barbarian coalitions.

Its goal was not to conquer and subjugate the barbarians but to “rule [them] with a loose rein” (ji mi).

[I]f the tribes are divided among themselves they [will remain] weak and [it will be] easy to hold them in subjection; if the tribes are separated they shun each other and readily obey. We favor one or other [of their chieftains] and permit them to fight each other. This is a principle of political action which asserts: “Wars between the ‘barbarians’ are auspicious for China.”.

They invited other European countries in for the purpose of first stimulating and then manipulating their rivalry.

To give them . . . elaborate clothes and carriages in order to corrupt their eyes; to give them fine food in order to corrupt their mouth; to give them music and women in order to corrupt their ears; to provide them with lofty buildings, granaries and slaves in order to corrupt their stomach . . . and, as for those who come to surrender, the emperor [should] show them favor by honoring them with an imperial reception party in which the emperor should personally serve them wine and food so as to corrupt their mind. These are what may be called the five baits.

A turbulent history has taught Chinese leaders that not every problem has a solution and that too great an emphasis on total mastery over specific events could upset the harmony of the universe.

Rarely did Chinese statesmen risk the outcome of a conflict on a single all-or-nothing clash; elaborate multiyear maneuvers were closer to their style.

Rarely did Chinese statesmen risk the outcome of a conflict on a single all-or-nothing clash; elaborate multiyear maneuvers were closer to their style. Where the Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces emphasizing feats of heroism, the Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage.

If chess is about the decisive battle, wei qi is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wei qi player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wei qi player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy. Chess teaches the Clausewitzian concepts of “center of gravity” and the “decisive point”—the game usually beginning as a struggle for the center of the board. Wei qi teaches the art of strategic encirclement. Where the skillful chess player aims to eliminate his opponent’s pieces in a series of head-on clashes, a talented wei qi player moves into “empty” spaces on the board, gradually mitigating the strategic potential of his opponent’s pieces. Chess produces single-mindedness; wei qi generates strategic flexibility.

Chinese thinkers developed strategic thought that placed a premium on victory through psychological advantage and preached the avoidance of direct conflict.

Ultimate excellence lies Not in winning Every battle But in defeating the enemy Without ever fighting.

In contrast to the Western approach of treating history as a process of modernity achieving a series of absolute victories over evil and backwardness, the traditional Chinese view of history emphasized a cyclical process of decay and rectification, in which nature and the world can be understood but not completely mastered.

China entered the modern age a singular kind of empire: a state claiming universal relevance for its culture and institutions but making few efforts to proselytize; the wealthiest country in the world but one that was indifferent to foreign trade and technological innovation; a culture of cosmopolitanism overseen by a political elite oblivious to the onset of the Western age of exploration; and a political unit of unparalleled geographic extent that was unaware of the technological and historical currents that would soon threaten its existence.

Count Nikolai Ignatieff, the Czar’s brilliant and devious young plenipotentiary in Beijing, managed to convince the Chinese court that only Russia could secure the evacuation of the Western occupying powers from the Chinese capital, and to convince the Western powers that only Russia could secure Chinese compliance with the treaties.

The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,.

A Communist state, according to Mao, must not turn into a bureaucratic society; the motivating force must be ideology rather than hierarchy.

In pursuit of the Great Harmony, Mao launched the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, which invited public debate and then turned on those intellectuals who practiced it; the Great Leap Forward in 1958, designed to catch up with the West industrially in a three-year period but which led to one of the most pervasive famines in modern history and produced a split in the Communist Party; and the Cultural Revolution in 1966, in which a generation of trained leaders, professors, diplomats, and experts were sent to the countryside to work on farms to learn from the masses.

Only a people as resilient and patient as the Chinese could emerge unified and dynamic after such a roller coaster ride through history.

Stalin was by now beyond ideology. His leadership was instead marked by a ruthless, cynical Machiavellianism based on his brutal interpretation of Russian national history.

The efficacy of the threat is measured by things that do not happen, that is, the wars being avoided.

His motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.

Wherever possible, he strove for the initiative. On one level, this was similar to the Western concept of preemption—anticipating an attack by launching the first blow. But in the Western doctrine, preemption seeks victory and a military advantage. Mao’s approach to preemption differed in the extraordinary attention he paid to psychological elements. His motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.

As we shall see in the later chapters, Chinese actions in the Taiwan Strait Crises of 1954–58, the Indian border clash of 1962, the conflict with the Soviets along the Ussuri River in 1969–71, and the Sino-Vietnam War of 1979 all had the common feature of a sudden blow followed quickly by a political phase.

In the West, the Cold War and the destructiveness of nuclear weapons have produced the concept of deterrence: to pose risks of destruction to a potential aggressor out of proportion to any possible gain. The efficacy of the threat is measured by things that do not happen, that is, the wars being avoided.

OTTO VON BISMARCK, probably the greatest diplomat of the second half of the nineteenth century, once said that in a world order of five states, it is always desirable to be part of a group of three. Applied to the interplay of three countries, one would therefore think that it is always desirable to be in a group of two.

Mao added a novel dimension to power politics, one for which I know of no precedent. Far from seeking the support of either superpower—as traditional balance-of-power theory would have counseled—he exploited the Soviet-U.S. fear of each other by challenging each of the rivals simultaneously.

Almost all postcolonial countries have insisted on the borders within which they achieved independence. To throw them open to negotiations invites unending controversies and domestic pressure. On the principle that he was not elected to bargain away territory that he considered indisputably Indian, Nehru rejected.

“A person sleeping in a comfortable bed is not easily roused by someone else’s snoring.”.

In meetings of the Central Military Commission and of top leaders, Mao commented on Nehru’s Forward Policy with one of his epigrams: “A person sleeping in a comfortable bed is not easily roused by someone else’s snoring.”.

Since Nehru sticks his head out and insists on us fighting him, for us not to fight with him would not be friendly enough. Courtesy emphasizes reciprocity.

“For a communist the minimum requirement is that he should make a clear distinction between the enemy and ourselves, that he should be ruthless towards the enemy and kind to his own comrades.”.

Deng Xiaoping, the principal leader of China from 1979 to 1991, argued that the Cultural Revolution had nearly destroyed the Communist Party as an institution and wrecked its credibility at least temporarily.

Cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors. There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.”.

# The Ride of a Lifetime (Robert Iger;)

I’d been in Shanghai for two weeks and was running on adrenaline.

In the sixty-one years since Walt Disney built Disneyland in Anaheim, California, we’d opened parks in Orlando and Paris and Tokyo and Hong Kong.

The bond you form in high-stress moments like this, when you’re sharing information that you can’t discuss with anyone else, is a powerful one.

I’m often asked what aspect of the job most keeps me up at night. The honest answer is that I don’t agonize over the work very much. I don’t know if it’s a quirk of brain chemistry, or a defense mechanism I developed in reaction to some family chaos in my youth, or the result of years of discipline—some combination of all of those things, I suppose—but I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry.

I don’t know if it’s a quirk of brain chemistry, or a defense mechanism I developed in reaction to some family chaos in my youth, or the result of years of discipline—some combination of all of those things, I suppose—but I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry. And I tend to approach bad news as a problem that can be worked through and solved, something I have control over rather than something happening to me. But I’m also all too aware of the symbolic power of Disney as a target, and the one thing that weighs heavily on me is the knowledge that no matter how vigilant we are, we can’t prepare for everything.

Sometimes, even though you’re “in charge,” you need to be aware that in the moment you might have nothing to add, and so you don’t wade in. You trust your people to do their jobs and focus your energies on some other pressing issue.

Tender Is the Night or For Whom the Bell Tolls or dozens of others and devour them, and he’d urge me to read even more.

He was always deeply politically engaged and had a very strong liberal bias.

He had a fierce sense of what was right and fair, and he was always on the side of the underdog.

Those hours aren’t for everyone, but however you find the time, it’s vital to create space in each day to let your thoughts wander beyond your immediate job responsibilities, to turn things over in your mind in a less pressured, more creative way than is possible once the daily triage kicks in.

We’ve become much more aware of the need for fair, equal, non-abusive treatment in the workplace, but it has taken too long.

I spent the hundred dollars almost immediately, but the lighter sits in a drawer in my desk to this day.

The show was more important to Roone than to the people who made it, and you had to make peace with that if you worked for him.

After a moment of stunned silence, I said, “Well, some days I feel like it’s tough just keeping my head above water.” Roone looked straight ahead. Without missing a beat, he said, “Get a longer snorkel.”.

It’s a delicate thing, finding the balance between demanding that your people perform and not instilling a fear of failure in them.

In my early days, I thought there was only one lesson in this story, the obvious one about the importance of taking responsibility when you screw up.

In your work, in your life, you’ll be more respected and trusted by the people around you if you honestly own up to your mistakes. It’s impossible not to make them; but it is possible to acknowledge them, learn from them, and set an example that it’s okay to get things wrong sometimes. What’s not okay is to undermine others by lying about something or covering your own ass first.

It’s so simple that you might think it doesn’t warrant mentioning, but it’s surprisingly rare: Be decent to people.

It’s so simple that you might think it doesn’t warrant mentioning, but it’s surprisingly rare: Be decent to people. Treat everyone with fairness and empathy. This doesn’t mean that you lower your expectations or convey the message that mistakes don’t matter. It means that you create an environment where people know you’ll hear them out, that you’re emotionally consistent and fair-minded, and that they’ll be given second chances for honest mistakes. (If they don’t own up to their mistakes, or if they blame someone else, or if the mistake is the result of some unethical behavior, that’s a different story, and something that shouldn’t be tolerated.).

There’s a related lesson, though, that I only came to fully appreciate years later, when I was in a position of real leadership.

But years later, when I was given the chance to lead, I was instinctively aware of both the need to strive for perfection and the pitfalls of caring only about the product and never the people.

He knew what he didn’t know.

(Warren Buffett later called them “probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see”),.

In part this is just garden-variety ambition.

My instinct throughout my career has always been to say yes to every opportunity. In part this is just garden-variety ambition. I wanted to move up and learn and do more, and I wasn’t going to forgo any chance to do that, but I also wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of doing things that I was unfamiliar with.

They would talk about valuing ability more than experience, and they believed in putting people in roles that required more of them than they knew they had in them.

“We want you to survive here, Bob. We hope when you’re done you’ll be carrying your shield and not being carried out on it!”.

They would have been completely justified in their disdain for the guy who knew nothing about their business but was about to be their boss. Instead, they were two of the most supportive people I’ve ever worked with, and their support started that first night.

They would have been completely justified in their disdain for the guy who knew nothing about their business but was about to be their boss. Instead, they were two of the most supportive people I’ve ever worked with, and their support started that first night. I told them over dinner that I needed their help. They knew the business, and I didn’t, but our fates were intertwined now, and I hoped they would be willing to be patient with me as I learned on the job. “Don’t worry, Bob. We’ll teach you,” Stu said. “It’ll be great. Trust us.”.

There’s nothing less confidence-inspiring than a person faking a knowledge they don’t possess.

There’s nothing less confidence-inspiring than a person faking a knowledge they don’t possess. True authority and true leadership come from knowing who you are and not pretending to be anything else.

Empathy is a prerequisite to the sound management of creativity, and respect is critical.

It’s a small gesture, but I remember how it felt to be the overlooked sidekick, and anything that reminds you that you’re not the center of the universe is a good thing.

My old mentors—Roone in News, Dennis Swanson in Sports—were now reporting to me. Ted Harbert, who along with Stu Bloomberg had.

Trajectory. I wouldn’t as a rule recommend promoting someone as rapidly as they promoted me, but I will say one more time, because it bears repeating: The way they conveyed their faith in me at every step made all the difference in my success.

“Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year!”.

When the two people at the top of a company have a dysfunctional relationship, there’s no way that the rest of the company beneath them can be functional.

Attentive. You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to learn and absorb. You have to hear out other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of being a great manager.

I’ve been asked a lot over the years about the best way to nurture ambition—both one’s own and that of the people you manage. As a leader, you should want those around you to be eager to rise up and take on more responsibility, as long as dreaming about the job they want doesn’t distract them from the job they have.

As a leader, you should want those around you to be eager to rise up and take on more responsibility, as long as dreaming about the job they want doesn’t distract them from the job they have. You can’t let ambition get too far ahead of opportunity. I’ve seen a lot of people who had their sights set on a particular job or project, but the opportunity to actually get that thing was so slim. Their focus on the small thing in the distance became a problem. They grew impatient with where they were. They didn’t tend enough to the responsibilities they did have, because they were longing so much for something else, and so their ambition became counterproductive. It’s important to know how to find the balance—do the job you have well; be patient; look for opportunities to pitch in and expand and grow; and make yourself one of the people, through attitude and energy and focus, that your bosses feel they have to turn to when an opportunity arises.

Conversely, if you’re a boss, these are the people to nurture—not the ones who are clamoring for promotions and complaining about not being utilized enough but the ones who are proving themselves to be indispensable day in and day out.

We all want to believe we’re irreplaceable. The trick is to be self-aware enough that you don’t cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job. At its essence, good leadership isn’t about being indispensable; it’s about helping others be prepared to possibly step into your shoes—giving them access to your own decision making, identifying the skills they need to develop and helping them improve, and, as I’ve had to do, sometimes being honest with them about why they’re not ready for the next step up.

He understood that “great” is often a collection of very small things, and he helped me appreciate that even more deeply.

“Bob, you know you did that, but the world doesn’t need to know, so shut up!”).

Then our largest shareholder, the Bass family, were forced to sell a massive amount of Disney stock—135 million shares, worth about $2 billion—to cover a margin call, which precipitated another steep drop in our share price.

No one could have handled the stress that Michael was under perfectly, but optimism in a leader, especially in challenging times, is so vital. Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion.

The tone you set as a leader has an enormous effect on the people around you. No one wants to follow a pessimist.

He was largely responsible for bringing Michael on as CEO and chairman of the board, and along with all shareholders, he benefited greatly under Michael’s leadership. Between 1984 and 1994, Disney’s annual profits quadrupled, and its stock price increased 1,300 percent.

On a lesser but maybe more illustrative note, he got very angry one Christmas season when we decided to sell pure white Mickey Mouse plush dolls in our Disney stores. “Mickey is only these colors, black and white and red and yellow, and that’s it!” Roy raged in emails to Michael and me. He wanted the “albino Mickeys,” as he called them, taken from the shelves, which we didn’t do, but it was a huge distraction.

It’s only about the future.

Response could simply and honestly be: “I can’t do anything about the past. We can talk about lessons learned, and we can make sure we apply those lessons going forward. But we don’t get any do-overs. You want to know where I’m going to take this company, not where it’s been. Here’s my plan.”.

“Stop talking. Once you have that many of them, they’re no longer priorities.” Priorities are the few things that you’re going to spend a lot of time and a lot of capital on. Not only do you undermine their significance by having too many, but nobody is going to remember them all. “You’re going to seem unfocused,” he said. “You only get three. I can’t tell you what those three should be. We don’t have to figure that out today. You never have to tell me what they are if you don’t want to. But you only get three.”.

A company’s culture is shaped by a lot of things, but this is one of the most important—you have to convey your priorities clearly and repeatedly. In my experience, it’s what separates great managers from the rest.

Time and energy and capital get wasted. People in your organization suffer unnecessary anxiety because they don’t know what they should be focused on. Inefficiency sets in, frustration builds up, morale sinks.

You can do a lot for the morale of the people around you (and therefore the people around them) just by taking the guesswork out of their day-to-day life.

It’s so easy to get caught up in rumor mills, to worry about this person’s perception of you or that person’s, what someone might say or write about you. It’s easy to become defensive and petty and to want to lash out when you feel you’re being unfairly misrepresented. I didn’t believe I deserved this job; I didn’t think I was entitled to it, but I did believe I was right for it.

It’s easy to be optimistic when everyone is telling you you’re great. It’s much harder, and much more necessary, when your sense of yourself is being challenged, and in such a public way.

Don’t let your ego get in the way of making the best possible decision.

If you approach and engage people with respect and empathy, the seemingly impossible can become real.

Team. You can’t wear your disdain for people on your sleeve, though.

No matter how much data you’ve been given, it’s still, ultimately, a risk, and the decision to take that risk or not comes down to one person’s instinct.

I can’t imagine what he must have felt. He’d come in two decades earlier and saved the company, and now he was driving away knowing that his era was over and that the place that he had turned into the largest entertainment company in the world would keep going on without him. It’s one of those moments, I imagine, when it’s hard to know who exactly you are without this attachment and title and role that has defined you for so long.

“The average tenure for a Fortune 500 CEO is less than four years.”.

One of the things I’ve always instinctively felt—and something that was greatly reinforced working for people like Roone and Michael—is that long shots aren’t usually as long as they seem.

Steve said he loved whiteboard exercises, where an entire vision—all the thoughts and designs and calculations—could be drawn out, at the whim of whoever held the felt pen.

Another lesson: Steve was great at weighing all sides of an issue and not allowing negatives to drown out positives, particularly for things he wanted to accomplish. It was a powerful quality of his.

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.”.

(“I hate them more than I hate videogames,” he told me),.

“You can’t think of me as that. That’s insulting. I’m just a good friend.”.

There’s no good playbook for how to fire someone, though I have my own internal set of rules. You have to do it in person, not over the phone and certainly not by email or text. You have to look the person in the eye. You can’t use anyone else as an excuse. This is you making a decision about them—not them as a person but the way they have performed in their job—and they need and deserve to know that it’s coming from you. You can’t make small talk once you bring someone in for that conversation. I normally say something along the lines of: “I’ve asked you to come in here for a difficult reason.” And then I try to be as direct about the issue as possible, explaining clearly and concisely what wasn’t working and why I didn’t think it was going to change.

I emphasize that it was a tough decision to make, and that I understand that it’s much harder on them. There’s a kind of euphemistic corporate language that is often deployed in those situations, and it has always struck me as offensive. There’s no way for the conversation not to be painful, but at least it can be honest, and in being honest there is at least a chance for the person on the receiving end to understand why it’s happening and eventually move on, even if they walk out of the room angry as hell.

The worst thing you can do when entering into a negotiation is to suggest or promise something because you know the other person wants to hear it, only to have to reverse course later.

Did we have the stomach to start cannibalizing our own still-profitable businesses in order to begin building a new model? Could we disrupt ourselves, and would Wall Street tolerate the losses that we would inevitably incur as we tried to truly modernize and transform the company? We.

Did we have the stomach to start cannibalizing our own still-profitable businesses in order to begin building a new model? Could we disrupt ourselves, and would Wall Street tolerate the losses that we would inevitably incur as we tried to truly modernize and transform the company?.

So the next question was: Do we build a tech platform or do we buy one?.

(Although I did believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.).

“If something doesn’t feel right to you, then it’s probably not right for you.”.

“Collectively, you mean the world to me,” he wrote, “and I deeply apologize if I have let you down. I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form. No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.”.

Your confidence can easily tip over into overconfidence and become a liability.

“I never dreamed I would one day lead the company responsible for so many of my greatest childhood memories,”.

Maybe this is the case for many of us: No matter who we become or what we accomplish, we still feel that we’re essentially the kid we were at some simpler time long ago. Somehow that’s the trick of leadership, too, I think, to hold on to that awareness of yourself even as the world tells you how powerful and important you are. The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you’ve lost your way. That may be the hardest but also the most necessary lesson to keep in mind, that wherever you are along the path, you’re the same person you’ve always been.

You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to listen to other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of the job.

You have to be self-aware enough that you don’t cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job.

A company’s reputation is the sum total of the actions of its people and the quality of its products.

“Great” is often a collection of very small things, after all.

Optimism emerges from faith in yourself and in the people who work for you. It’s not about saying things are good when they’re not, and it’s not about conveying some blind faith that “things will work out.”.

Long shots aren’t usually as long as they seem.

Treating others with respect is an undervalued currency when it comes to negotiating.

When hiring, try to surround yourself with people who are good in addition to being good at what they do.

It’s not good to have power for too long. You don’t realize the way your voice seems to boom louder than every other voice in the room. You get used to people withholding their opinions until they hear what you have to say.

It’s not good to have power for too long. You don’t realize the way your voice seems to boom louder than every other voice in the room. You get used to people withholding their opinions until they hear what you have to say. People are afraid to bring ideas to you, afraid to dissent, afraid to engage.

You have to approach your work and life with a sense of genuine humility.

The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look at yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you’ve lost your way.

It was Roone who taught me: Innovate or die..


# The To-Do List (Mike Gayle)

The answer, to me at least, is simple: love. I’m doing it all for love. Because no matter how you say it and how often it gets said, actions will always speak louder than words and right now, though some might call it pointless, frivolous, or just plain stupid, flying to the other side of the Atlantic for the sake of a $12 coffee mug is the one thing I want to say in the loudest possible way.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh. ‘Did I leave anything out?’.

Would a ‘proper adult’ have underwear in active service that was well over a decade old?.

After sweeping a pile of discarded newspapers and sweet wrappers onto the floor, I settled myself at my desk and in large capital letters wrote the words that would change my life: ‘TO-DO LIST.’.

To me a list is a statement of intent, a plan, a map to point you in the right direction. Without my To-Do Lists I’d be lost. Without my To-Do Lists I would just be making stuff up as I went along and that, as far as I’m concerned, is no way to live a life.

My early To-Do Lists tended to be lists of books that I wanted to read, and each time I read one I got a tick. Now, while the writing of a list can be a reward in itself, as any veteran To-Do Lister will attest, the real pay-off is the satisfaction that comes from ticking, crossing, or scribbling an item off your list. With one neat action a task that has been bugging you for the longest time is utterly obliterated. Pow! It’s gone. Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.

With one neat action a task that has been bugging you for the longest time is utterly obliterated. Pow! It’s gone. Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.        Soon after reaching secondary school in the early eighties, I came to realise that the making of To-Do Lists wasn’t just an idle pastime but rather a means of survival, the significance of which I learned the hard way.

‘Unless you’re dead there’s always going to be stuff that needs doing.’.

Canadians appear to be not only incredibly sensible but also really nice. Trust me, every home should have one.

I share this story in order to illustrate an important fact about myself: when it comes to an undertaking, I am the very definition of: ‘Act first. Think later’. And the To-Do List was no exception.

My first step was to head for the shops in the hope that purchasing useful things would miraculously change my life.

Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask,.

‘Organise book shelves so that you can find a specific book without looking through everything’).

‘Since we’re talking lists, I will tell you something that I don’t tell many people because they’d laugh at me: I make To-Do Lists all the time and sometimes when I’m feeling particularly low I put things like “Take a shower” just to have the satisfaction of ticking it off. It’s my kick-start for the day.’.

In fact I would break them up into the things that you’re excited about and the things that you’re not so excited about and then alternate them so there’s always something to look forward to. It’s like eating your pudding before your tea. If you do, there’s no incentive to eat your tea.’.

I encourage people to put on their list to “think” about things and “explore” so that the list is creative in itself.’.

‘That’s easy. The best thing is to tell every single person you know what you’re doing so that you commit yourself fully to the project.’.

7. To make sure Gayle doesn’t give up halfway, there will be an audit at the end of April just to make sure that he’s on track.

‘How can I go back to sleep when you’ve just told me there’s nothing to worry about?’ She too sat bolt upright. ‘What is it exactly that I shouldn’t be worrying about?’        ‘The To-Do List,’ I replied.

‘Good, we’re on the same page then. Now, listen, Mike, I love you, you know I do, but right now I really, really, really have to go to sleep. So if you wake me up again with any more revelations I can’t be held responsible for my actions, okay?’        ‘Yeah,’ I replied. ‘Okay.’.

‘All I know is this: you might have given up the List but the List doesn’t seem to have given up on you.’.

We hadn’t always been the people we were now.

Some things he ticked off the list and some things he didn’t.

‘La, la, la, I’m not listening! La, la, la! You think I’m listening but I’m not!’.

As those months became two years I began to wonder whether I was suffering from some kind of mental illness which led me to confuse the act of cancelling my direct debit with dumping a particularly tear prone girlfriend.

Step 1) present the person/multinational you wish to leave with an insurmountable problem that explains why you want to call it off. Step 2) cross your fingers and hope that they can’t come up with a solution.

‘Because I don’t want to be calm! I’ve just had the phone put down on me! Have you any idea how outrageous that is? What kind of world do we live in where people can put phones down on other people just because they’re recording phone calls? This isn’t Communist-era eastern Germany you know? I’ve got rights! This is England!’.

“Catch up with lost friends because you know what? They used to be great friends”.’.

‘Because when you’re a man, ignorance isn’t just bliss. It’s also the stuff that keeps the walls from falling down.’.

‘Start losing weight before you end up in a Channel Five documentary about fat people so huge that they have to be winched out of bed by helicopter’.

‘Okay, then it has to be receiving murderous phone calls on stormy nights only to call the operator and be told that they’re coming from inside the house!’.

Claire referring to our children as my children was a bad sign. I was in big trouble.

Love you, you know,’ I whispered in her ear. ‘A lot of women would make a big deal about their husbands clearing off around the world at the drop of a hat so it’s really cool that you’re being so understanding.’.

‘We’ll deal with it when we deal with it but I’m making no promises that it will be okay.’.

I couldn’t believe it. It had only been a couple of months since I’d made her a grandmother for the second time and she was already holding out for more? Was no number of grandchildren enough to sate this woman?.

‘So you were hoping Claire and I would have another baby just so that they didn’t go to waste?’.

This is the twenty-first century, babe. Real men moisturise.’.

‘Be nicer to wife because it’ll only be a matter of time before she compares notes with her mates and finally works out what kind of a rough deal she’s on’,.

‘It feels a bit girlie. I told Claire that real men moisturise but I’m pretty sure they don’t. Other than shower gel, deodorant, aftershave and a bit of toothpaste, real men don’t do toiletries.’.

Peace.        War and Peace (Item 1021) had been on my mental To-Do List for some years now. Having first been introduced to the novel by my secondary school English teacher, Mrs Parker, who hailed it as a ‘must read classic’, at the age of thirteen I had searched it out from my local library and had been stunned to discover that it was roughly the same size and density as a house brick.

War and Peace (Item 1021) had been on my mental To-Do List for some years now. Having first been introduced to the novel by my secondary school English teacher, Mrs Parker, who hailed it as a ‘must read classic’, at the age of thirteen I had searched it out from my local library and had been stunned to discover that it was roughly the same size and density as a house brick.

I’d think to myself, one day I really must get around to reading that and while novels that I had previously put into that category, like Slaughter House Five and On The Road, got read, when it came to War and Peace I always seemed to find something more pressing to do. This time was going to be different. This time I was going to give Tolstoy my very best shot.

I don’t know how but I can tell that even from behind her sunglasses Claire is rolling her eyes.

‘I think that it’s probably an okay book if you’re into Russian literature but most people read War and Peace because it’s a big fat book that gets name dropped a lot as a shorthand signifier of supposed intellectual greatness.

George Leigh Mallory wanted to climb Mount Everest: ‘Because it’s there.’.

It was like that maxim of Karl Marx that a man should be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner without permanently becoming hunter, fisherman, cowherd or critic.

I needed to do something special for her.

I needed to do something special for her. Something to demonstrate that I really did think she was the best woman in the world. Three days later I hit the jackpot.

This is trying my patience to the extent that I am verbally abusing both the computer and the printer with the threat of violence.

I am wishing that someone would invent a machine that would just do the things that you want it to do without you having to get involved with any of it. 2.05 p.m. I’ve just repeated my invention wish to Claire. She tells me I’ve already got one: ‘It’s called a wife and it’s how ninety per cent of the things that need doing in our house actually get done.’.

‘Try to make friends with new and interesting people so that you don’t spend your whole life talking about films, music and last week’s episode of Dr Who.’ Just.

It was more than that. It was hopes and dreams and me getting a life and being a proper grown-up.’.

‘Freud would say that there are no accidents and that it was probably your sub-conscious mind’s way of saying you’re getting sick of all this To-Do-List stuff.’        ‘Well, it’s a good job that Freud isn’t here otherwise I’d have to tell him he was quite wrong and the last thing I’d want to do is offend the father of modern psychoanalysis by telling him he was talking cobblers.’.

‘So why are you crying then?’        ‘I’m not,’ she said, wiping her eyes. ‘You must be seeing things.’.

‘I feel stupid because it happened ages ago and I should have said something at the time but I didn’t want to seem petty, but the fact is you hurt my feelings and I think you ought to know why.’.

‘Because even if I’m not the most efficient person in the world – which I admit I’m not – it would be nice if there were one person in the world who thinks I’m great at everything.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’ I paused and added a timely, ‘I love you, you know.’.

‘Do you know what, Simon?’ I began, ‘I think I really am. I had a problem with it before because I thought it would end up just being about a bloke ticking things off a list. I can see now that it will actually be about lots of other stuff too like family and friendship, overcoming obstacles, growing up, taking risks and learning about the things you’re really capable of.’.


# All the Bright Places (Jennifer Niven)

The world breaks everyone, and afterward, many are strong at the broken places. —Ernest Hemingway.


# Crime and Punishment (Transl. Richard Pevear, Larissa Volokhonsky) (Fyodor Dostoevsky)

He was so immersed in himself and had isolated himself so much from everyone that he was afraid not only of meeting his landlady but of meeting anyone at all.

“Hm...yes...man has it all in his hands, and it all slips through his fingers from sheer cowardice...That is an axiom...I wonder, what are people most afraid of? A new step, their own new word, that's what they're most afraid of...I babble too much, however. That's why I don't do anything, because I babble. However, maybe it's like this: I babble because I don't do anything. I've learned to babble over this past month, lying in a corner day in and day out, thinking about...cuckooland. Why on earth am I going now? Am I really capable of that? Is that something serious? No, not serious at all. I'm just toying with it, for the sake of fantasy. A plaything! Yes, a plaything, if you like!”.

With one's dress. The proximity of the Haymarket,.

Descending a flight of stairs from somewhere, his foppish.

Flight of stairs.

We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.

“May I venture, my dear sir, to engage you in a conversation of decency?.

Did you ever happen to spend your nights on the Neva, on the hay barges?”.

This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home.

This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home. Hence, in a company of drinkers, they always seem eager to solicit justification for themselves and, if possible, even respect as well.

Marmeladov had long been a familiar there. And his penchant for ornate speech he had probably acquired as a result of his habit of frequent tavern conversation with various strangers. This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home. Hence, in a company of drinkers, they always seem eager to solicit justification for themselves and, if possible, even respect as well.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere!.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere! When my only-begotten daughter went out for the first time with a yellow pass,[5] and I went, too, then...(for my daughter lives on a yellow pass, sir...),” he added parenthetically, glancing somewhat worriedly at the young man. “Never mind, my dear sir, never mind!” he hastened to declare at once and with apparent calm, when both lads at the counter snorted and the proprietor himself smiled.

“Never mind, sir. I am not troubled by this wagging of heads, for everything is already known to everyone, and everything hidden will be made manifest;.

“Never mind, sir. I am not troubled by this wagging of heads, for everything is already known to everyone, and everything hidden will be made manifest;[6] I regard it not with disdain, but with humility. Let it be! Let it be! 'Behold the man!'[7] Excuse me, young man, but can you...Or, no, to expound it more forcefully and more expressively: not can you, but would you venture, looking upon me at this hour, to say of me affirmatively that I am not a swine?”.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it. It is for this I drink, that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it. It is for this I drink, that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling. It is not joy I seek, but sorrow only...I drink, for I wish doubly to suffer!”.

“Young man,” he continued, unbending again, “in your face I read, as it were, a certain sorrow. I read it when you entered, and therefore I addressed you at once. For by telling you the story of my life, I do not wish to expose myself to disgrace before these lovers of idleness, who know everything anyway, but am seeking a sensitive and educated man. Know, then, that my spouse was educated in an aristocratic provincial institute for the nobility and at her graduation danced with a shawl before the governor and other notables,[8] for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal...well, we sold the medal...long ago...hm...the certificate of merit is still lying in her trunk, she showed it to our landlady just recently. And though she is in the most ceaseless strife with our landlady, still she wished to feel proud before someone at least and to tell of the happy days gone by. And I do not judge, I do not judge, for this is the last thing left to her in her memories, and the rest has all gone to ruin! Yes, yes, she is a hot, proud, and unbending lady. She washes the floors herself and eats black bread, but disrespect for herself she will not tolerate. That is why she would not let Mr. Lebezyatnikov get away with his rudeness, and when Mr. Lebezyatnikov gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed, not so much from the beating as from emotion. She came to me already a widow, with three children, each one smaller than the next. She had married her first husband, an infantry officer, out of love, and eloped with him from her parental home. She loved her husband exceedingly, but he got into card-playing, was taken to court, and thereupon died. He used to beat her towards the end; and though she would not let him get away with it, as I am informed of a certainty and with documents, yet to this day she remembers him with tears and holds him up to me in reproach—and I am glad, I am glad, for at least in her imaginings she beholds herself as having once been happy...And after him she was left with three young children in a remote and savage district, where I was living at the time, and she was left in such hopeless destitution.

'What, Katerina Ivanovna, must I really go and do such a thing?' And Darya Frantsevna, an ill-meaning woman and one oft-known to the police, had already made inquiries three times through the landlady. 'And what,' Katerina Ivanovna answered mockingly, 'what's there to save? Some treasure!' But do not blame her, do not blame her, my dear sir, do not blame her! She said this not in her right mind but in emotional agitation, in sickness, and with the children crying from hunger, and said it, besides, more for the sake of the insult than in any strict sense...For such is Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when the children get to crying, even if it's from hunger, she starts beating them at once.

Ill-meaning persons—which Darya Frantsevna especially abetted,.

'You sweet little thing!’”.

Do you think, wine-merchant, that this bottle of yours brought me sweetness? Sorrow, sorrow I sought at its bottom, sorrow and tears, and I tasted it and found it;.

'Come! I have already forgiven you once...I have forgiven you once...And now, too, your many sins are forgiven, for you have loved much[15]...'.

“It's not Katerina Ivanovna I'm afraid of now,” he muttered in agitation, “and not that she'll start pulling my hair. Forget the hair! ... The hair's nonsense! I can tell you! It's even better if she starts pulling it; that's not what I'm afraid of...I...it's her eyes I'm afraid of...yes...her eyes... I'm also afraid of the flushed spots on her cheeks, and also—her breathing . .. Have you ever seen how people with that illness breathe...when their feelings are aroused? And I'm afraid of the children's crying, too...Because if Sonya hasn't been feeding them, then...I don't know what! I really don't! And I'm not afraid of a beating...Know, sir, that such beatings are not only not painful, but are even a delight to me...For I myself cannot do without them. It's better. Let her beat me, to ease her soul...it's better...Here's the house. Kozel's house. A locksmith, a German, a rich one...take me in!”.

Wept a bit and got accustomed. Man gets accustomed to everything, the scoundrel!”.

“But if that's a lie”,” he suddenly exclaimed involuntarily, “if man in fact is not a scoundrel—in general, that is, the whole human race—then the rest is all mere prejudice, instilled fear, and there are no barriers, and that's just how it should be!.

Nastasya simply dissolved in laughter. She was the sort much given to laughter, and when something made her laugh, she laughed inaudibly, heaving and shaking her whole body, until she made herself sick.

Even in the most extreme situations she can find enough magnanimity in herself so as not to lose her firmness.

You know how I love you; you are all we have, Dunya.

And besides, if one wants to know any man well, one must consider him gradually and carefully, so as not to fall into error and prejudice, which are very difficult to correct and smooth out later.

Dunya, besides being an intelligent girl, is at the same time a noble being, like an angel, and will regard it as her duty to ensure the happiness of her husband, who in turn would be looking out for her happiness, and this last point, so far, we have no great reason to doubt, though one must admit that the matter has been done a bit too quickly.

A husband ought to owe nothing to his wife, but it is much better if a wife looks upon her husband as a benefactor.

'words are not yet deeds,'.

In order to judge a man, one must first observe him more closely, and that he would leave it to himself to form an opinion of you after making your acquaintance.

I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands do not much warm up to their mothers-in-law, and I not only do not want to be even the slightest burden to anyone, but I also want to be fully free myself, as long as I have at least a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dunechka.

Bread and butter for all, but bring your own tobacco, as the saying goes.

He kept tormenting and taunting himself with these questions, even taking a certain delight in it. None of the questions was new or sudden, however; they were all old, sore, long-standing. They had begun torturing him long ago and had worn out his heart. Long, long ago this present anguish had been born in him, had grown, accumulated, and ripened recently and become concentrated, taking the form of a horrible, wild, and fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind, irresistibly demanding resolution.

“Do you understand, do you understand, my dear sir, what it means when there is no longer anywhere to go?” he suddenly recalled Marmeladov's question yesterday. “For it is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go . . .”.

“Accept fate obediently as it is, once and for all, and stifle everything in myself, renouncing any right to act, to live, to love!”.

Somehow did not participate in any of it. He was a zealous.

The attempts of critics and literary scholars to define, or simply account for, what they have found in these novels may remind one of the Hindu parable of the blind men describing an elephant, each by feeling a different part—”a snake,” “a hog weed,” “a tree,” “a broom,” “a wall.”.

In Notes from the Dead House, a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences first published in 1860, a year after his return to Petersburg, he describes how he would sit looking at a corner of blue sky and think that there, beyond the prison walls, was another life, there was freedom, and one day he would leave his prison behind and find that free life waiting for him, and he would then live nobly, gratefully, and make no more mistakes.

Something else rose up in him in the person of the underground man, this “man of heightened consciousness,” with his mocking attacks on the laws of nature and arithmetic, on sensibleness, utility, profit, on development, civilization, and reason itself.

“Two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.”.

“But here, too, I'm lying! Lying, because I myself know, like two times two, that it is not at all the underground that is better, but something different, completely different, which I thirst for but cannot ever find!”.

His response was the world as viewed by the man from underground, whose ruminations are circumscribed by the same ideas, but who has recognized that his life cannot be accounted for by them, that in fact it cannot be accounted for by any laws or with any logical consistency. Nor can it be narrated as a meaningful sequence of events, in harmonious and dignified prose.

Nor can it be narrated as a meaningful sequence of events, in harmonious and dignified prose. It is all discontinuous, full of the sudden and the unexpected, disharmonious and undignified, terrible and at the same time comical. From this basis he generalizes his attack on the world view of enlightened Europe, particularly as adopted by the Russian intelligentsia.

He took special interest in the flowers; he looked longer at them than at anything else.

In a morbid condition, dreams are often distinguished by their remarkably graphic, vivid, and extremely lifelike quality.

Gallop!” And he takes a whip in his hand, already.

She falls to the ground as if all four legs had been cut from under her.

Sticks, the shaft—and run to the dying mare.

Of course, it had happened to him dozens of times that he would return home without remembering what streets he had taken.

This woman was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply Lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that same old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, widow of a collegiate registrar,[40] the money-lender whom Raskolnikov had visited the day before to pawn his watch and make his trial...He had long known all about this Lizaveta, and she even knew him slightly.

At first—even long before—he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes.

At first—even long before—he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes are so easily detected and solved, and why almost all criminals leave such an obviously marked trail. He came gradually to various and curious conclusions, the chief reason lying, in his opinion, not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself; the criminal himself, almost any criminal, experiences at the moment of the crime a sort of failure of will and reason, which, on the contrary, are replaced by a phenomenal, childish thoughtlessness, just at the moment when reason and prudence are most.

“If I'm to perish, let me perish, I don't care!.

He was a lieutenant, the police chief's assistant, with reddish moustaches sticking out horizontally on both sides, and with extremely small features, which, incidentally, expressed nothing in particular apart from a certain insolence.

“Well, listen: I came to you because aside from you I don't know anyone who would help...to start...because you're kinder than the rest of them—smarter, that is—and you're able to talk about things...But now I see that I need nothing, do you hear, absolutely nothing...no favors, no concern from anyone...I myself...alone...And enough! Let me be, all of you!”.

While he was attending the university, he often used to stop, mostly on his way home, at precisely this spot (he had done it perhaps a hundred times), and gaze intently at the indeed splendid panorama, and to be surprised almost every time by a certain unclear and unresolved impression.

It was as if he now saw all his former past, and former thoughts, and former tasks, and former themes, and former impressions, and this whole panorama, and himself, and everything, everything, somewhere far down below, barely visible under his feet...It seemed as if he were flying upwards somewhere, and everything was vanishing from his sight.

At times it seemed to him that he had been lying there for at least a month, at other times that it was still the same day.

Now...That's just the point: an honest and sensitive man opens his heart, and the man of business listens and goes on eating—and then he eats you up.

And I'm saying it out of love now...That's just the point: an honest and sensitive man opens his heart, and the man of business listens and goes on eating—and then he eats you up.

Raskolnikov was silent and did not resist, though he felt strong enough to raise himself and sit on the sofa without any external help, strong enough not only to hold the spoon or the cup, but perhaps even to walk. But from some strange, almost animal cunning, it suddenly occurred to him to conceal his strength for the time being, to lie low, to pretend, if necessary, that he had even not quite recovered his wits, and meanwhile to listen and learn what was going on there.

“Because you know what irks me the most about it? Not that they're lying; lying can always be forgiven; lying is a fine thing, because it leads to the truth. No, what irks me is that they lie and then worship their own lies.

But facts are not everything; at least half the game is knowing how to handle the facts!”.

Well, sir, it is precisely my notion that one sees and learns most of all by observing our younger generations.

“Practicality is acquired with effort, it doesn't fall from.

“Practicality is acquired with effort, it doesn't fall from the sky for free.

But it is my personal view, if you like, that something has been done: useful new ideas have been spread, and some useful new books, instead of the former dreamy and romantic ones; literature is acquiring a shade of greater maturity; many harmful prejudices have been eradicated and derided...In short, we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past, and that in itself, I think, is already something, sir . . .”.

“What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won't overtake any one of them.

“No, it is not a commonplace, sir! If up to now, for example, I have been told to 'love my neighbor,' and I did love him, what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovich continued, perhaps with unnecessary haste. “What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won't overtake any one of them.

If you love only yourself, you will set your affairs up properly, and your caftan will also remain in one piece. And economic truth adds that the more properly arranged personal affairs and, so to speak, whole caftans there are in society, the firmer its foundations are and the better arranged its common cause. It follows that by acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, I am thereby precisely acquiring for everyone, as it were, and working so that my neighbor will have something more than a torn caftan, not from private, isolated generosities now, but as a result of universal prosperity. A simple thought, which unfortunately has been too long in coming, overshadowed by rapturousness and dreaminess, though it seems it would not take much wit to realize . . .”.

I blush not only to say such things, but to hear them said in my presence.

He couldn't even rob, all he could do was kill!.

“where was it that I read about a man condemned to death saying or thinking, an hour before his death, that if he had to live somewhere high up on a cliffside, on a ledge so narrow that there was room only for his two feet—and with the abyss, the ocean, eternal darkness, eternal solitude, eternal storm all around him—and had to stay like that, on a square foot of space, an entire lifetime, a thousand years, an eternity—it would be better to live so than to die right now! Only to live, to live, to live! To live, no matter how—only to live![60].

Only to live, to live, to live! To live, no matter how—only to live![60]. . . How true! Lord, how true! Man is a scoundrel! And he's a scoundrel who calls him a scoundrel for that,” he added in a moment.

Lately she had begun talking more and more often to her older daughter, the ten-year-old Polenka, who, though she understood little as yet, still understood very well that her mother needed her, and therefore always followed her with her big, intelligent eyes, and used all her guile to pretend that she understood everything.

The tenants, one by one, squeezed back through the door, with that strange feeling of inner satisfaction which can always be observed, even in those who are near and dear, when a sudden disaster befalls their neighbor, and which is to be found in all men, without exception, however sincere their feelings of sympathy and commiseration.

He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked at her with something like happiness. It gave him such pleasure to look at her—he did not know why himself.

“And I had already consented to live on a square foot of space!.

Don't laugh, and don't be angry! ... Be angry with everyone else, but don't be angry with me!.

Lying is man's only privilege over all other organisms. If you lie—you get to the truth! Lying is what makes me a man. Not one truth has ever been reached without first lying fourteen times or so, maybe a hundred and fourteen, and that's honorable in its way; well, but we can't even lie with our own minds! Lie to me, but in your own way, and I'll kiss you for it.

Lying in one's own way is almost better than telling the truth in someone else's way; in the first case you're a man, and in the second—no better than a bird! The truth won't go away, but life can be nailed shut; there are examples. Well, so where are we all now? With regard to science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aspirations, liberalism, reason, experience, and everything, everything, everything, we're all, without exception, still sitting in the first grade! We like getting by on other people's reason—we've acquired a taste for it! Right? Am I right?”.

Wow!.

I'm unworthy of you, and drunk, and ashamed... I'm not worthy to love you, but to worship you is every man's duty, unless he's a perfect brute!.

“they may all be drunk at my place, but they're all honest, and though we do lie—because I lie, too—in the end we'll lie our way to the truth, because we're on a noble path,.

Angry...He was playing the orator here, showing off his knowledge, and then he left with his tail between his legs.

If at that moment they had ordered him to throw himself headlong down the stairs, as a service to them, he would have carried out the order at once, without argument or hesitation.

Nastasya will sit with him now, and I'll take you both to your place, because you can't go through the streets by yourselves; our Petersburg, in that respect... Well, spit on it!.

And we all realized as soon as he came in today that he was not a man of our kind. Not because he came with his hair curled by a hairdresser, not because he was in a hurry to show off his intelligence, but because he's a stool pigeon and a speculator; because he's a Jew and a mountebank, and it shows.

You think he's intelligent? No, he's a fool, a fool! So, is he a match for you? Oh, my God! You see, ladies,”.

But how becoming was her smile, how becoming her laughter—gay, young, wholehearted!.

The expression of her face was always serious and thoughtful rather than gay; but how becoming was her smile, how becoming her laughter—gay, young, wholehearted!.

“you're a nice fellow, but, on top of all your other bad qualities, you're also a philanderer, I know that, and a dirty one. You're a piece of nervous, weak-willed trash, you're whimsical, you've grown fat and can't deny yourself anything—and I call that dirty, because it leads straight to dirt. You've pampered yourself so much that, I confess, the thing I'm least able to understand is how with all that you can still be a good and even selfless physician. You sleep on a feather bed (you, a doctor!), yet you get up in the night for a sick man! In three years or so you won't be getting up for any sick man...But, the devil, that's not the point; the point is that you'll be spending the night in the landlady's apartment (it took a lot to convince her!), and I in the kitchen—so here's a chance for you to get more closely acquainted!.

What was there to be proud of in being a decent man?.

In the three years of your separation a lot of water has flowed under the bridge.

Sullen, gloomy, arrogant, proud; recently (and maybe much earlier) insecure and hypochondriac. Magnanimous and kind. Doesn't like voicing his feelings, and would rather do something cruel than speak his heart out in words. At times, however, he's not hypochondriac at all, but just inhumanly cold and callous, as if there really were two opposite characters in him, changing places with each other.

At times he's terribly taciturn! He's always in a hurry, always too busy, yet he lies there doing nothing. Not given to mockery, and not because he lacks sharpness but as if he had no time for such trifles. Never hears people out to the end. Is never interested in what interests everyone else at a given moment. Sets a terribly high value on himself and, it seems, not without a certain justification.

Crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social set-up— that alone and nothing more, no other causes are admitted—but nothing! . . .”.

With them one is always a 'victim of the environment'—and nothing else! Their favorite phrase! Hence directly that if society itself is normally set up, all crimes will at once disappear, because there will be no reason for protesting and everyone will instantly become righteous.

Nature isn't taken into account, nature is driven out, nature is not supposed to be! With them it's not mankind developing all along in a historical, living way that will finally turn by itself into a normal society, but, on the contrary, a social system, coming out of some mathematical head, will at once organize the whole of mankind and instantly make it righteous and sinless, sooner than any living process, without any historical and living way! That's why they have such an instinctive dislike of history: 'there's nothing in it but outrage and stupidity'—and everything is explained by stupidity alone! That's why they so dislike the living process of life: there's no need for the living soul! The living soul will demand life, the living soul won't listen to mechanics, the living soul is suspicious, the living soul is retrograde!.

Is there such a thing as crime, or not?.

And it turns out in the end that they've reduced everything to mere brickwork and the layout of corridors and rooms in a phalanstery![75] The phalanstery may be all ready, but your nature isn't ready for the phalanstery, it wants life, it hasn't completed the life process yet, it's too soon for the cemetery! You can't overleap nature with logic alone! Logic will presuppose three cases, when there are a million of them! Cut away the whole million, and reduce everything to the one question of comfort! The easiest solution to the problem! Enticingly clear, and there's no need to think! Above all, there's no need to think! The whole of life's mystery can fit on two printed pages!”.

I merely suggested that an 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is, not an official right, but his own right, to allow his conscience to...step over certain obstacles, and then only in the event that the fulfillment of his idea— sometimes perhaps salutary for the whole of mankind—calls for it. You have been pleased to say that my article is unclear; I am prepared to clarify it for you, as far as I can.

Kepler's or Newton's discoveries could become known to people in no other way than by sacrificing the lives of one, or ten, or a hundred or more people who were hindering the discovery, or standing as an obstacle in its path, then Newton would have the right, and it would even be his duty . . . to remove those ten or a hundred people, in order to make his discoveries known to all mankind.

Further, I recall developing in my article the idea that all... well, let's say, the lawgivers and founders of mankind, starting from the most ancient and going on to the Lycurguses, the Solons, the Muhammads, the Napoleons, and so forth,[77] that all of them to a man were criminals, from the fact alone that in giving a new law they thereby violated the old one, held sacred by society and passed down from their fathers, and they certainly did not stop at shedding blood either, if it happened that blood (sometimes quite innocent and shed valiantly for the ancient law) could help them. It is even remarkable that most of these benefactors and founders of mankind were especially terrible blood-shedders. In short, I deduce that all, not only great men, but even those who are a tiny bit off the beaten track—that is, who are a tiny bit capable of saying something new—by their very nature cannot fail to be criminals—more or less, to be sure. Otherwise it would be hard for them to get off the beaten track, and, of course, they cannot consent to stay on it, again by nature, and in my opinion it is even their duty not to consent. In short, you see that so far there is nothing especially new here.

It consists precisely in people being divided generally, according to the law of nature, into two categories: a lower or, so to speak, material category (the ordinary), serving solely for the reproduction of their own kind; and people proper—that is, those who have the gift or talent of speaking a new word in their environment. The subdivisions here are naturally endless, but the distinctive features of both categories are quite marked: people of the first, or material, category are by nature conservative, staid, live in obedience, and like being obedient. In my opinion they even must be obedient, because that is their purpose, and for them there is decidedly nothing humiliating in it. Those of the second category all transgress the law, are destroyers or inclined to destroy, depending on their abilities. The crimes of these people, naturally, are relative and variegated; for the most part they call, in quite diverse declarations, for the destruction of the present in the name of the better. But if such a one needs, for the sake of his idea, to step even over a dead body, over blood, then within himself, in his conscience, he can, in my opinion, allow himself to step over blood—depending, however, on the idea and its scale—make note of that. It is only in this sense that I speak in my article of their right to crime.

The first category is always master of the present; the second— master of the future. The first preserves the world and increases it numerically; the second moves the world and leads it towards a goal. Both the one and the other have a perfectly equal right to exist. In short, for me all men's rights are equivalent—and vive la guerre éternelle—until the New Jerusalem, of course!”[78].

It is only in this sense that I speak in my article of their right to crime. (You recall we began with the legal question.) However, there's not much cause for alarm: the masses hardly ever acknowledge this right in them; they punish them and hang them (more or less), thereby quite rightly fulfilling their conservative purpose; yet, for all that, in subsequent generations these same masses place the punished ones on a pedestal and worship them (more or less). The first category is always master of the present; the second— master of the future. The first preserves the world and increases it numerically; the second moves the world and leads it towards a goal. Both the one and the other have a perfectly equal right to exist.

“Generally, there are remarkably few people born who have a new thought, who are capable, if only slightly, of saying anything new—strangely few, in fact. One thing is clear, that the ordering of people's conception, all these categories and subdivisions, must be quite correctly and precisely determined by some law of nature. This law is as yet unknown, of course, but I believe that it exists and may one day be known. An enormous mass of people, of material, exists in the world only so that finally, through some effort, some as yet mysterious process, through some interbreeding of stocks and races, with great strain it may finally bring into the world, let's say, at least one somewhat independent man in a thousand.

Broader independence (I'm speaking approximately, graphically). With a still broader independence—one in a hundred thousand.

Perhaps one in ten thousand is born with a broader independence (I'm speaking approximately, graphically). With a still broader independence—one in a hundred thousand. Men of genius—one in millions; and great geniuses, the fulfillers of mankind—perhaps after the elapsing of many thousands of millions of people on earth.

“If I did, I would certainly not tell you,”.

Over...it wasn't a human being I killed, it was a principle! So I killed the principle, but I didn't step over, I stayed on this side...All I managed to do was kill.

Happiness'...No, life is given to me only once, and never will be again—I don't want to sit waiting for universal happiness. I want to live myself; otherwise it's better not to live at all. And so? I just didn't want to pass by my hungry mother, clutching my rouble in my pocket, while waiting for 'universal happiness.' To say, 'I'm carrying a little brick for universal happiness, and so there's a feeling of peace in my heart.'[82] Ha, ha! But why did you leave me out? I have only one life; I, too, want...Eh, an aesthetic louse is what I am, and nothing more,” he added, suddenly bursting into laughter like a madman. “Yes, I really am a louse,” he went on, gloatingly seizing upon the thought, rummaging in it, playing and amusing himself with it, “if only because, first, I'm now reasoning about being a louse; second, because I've been troubling all-good Providence for a whole month, calling it to witness that I was undertaking it not to satisfy my own flesh and lust, but with a splendid and agreeable goal in mind—ha, ha! Third, because I resolved to observe all possible justice in carrying it out, weight, measure, arithmetic: I chose the most useless louse of all and, having killed her, decided to take from her exactly as much as I needed for the first step, no more and no less (and the rest would thus simply go to the monastery, according to her will—ha, ha!)...And ultimately, ultimately I am a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “because I myself am perhaps even more vile and nasty than the louse I killed, and I had anticipated beforehand that I would tell myself so after I killed her. Can anything compare with such horror! Oh, triteness! Oh, meanness! ... Oh, how well I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed. Allah commands—obey, 'trembling' creature![83]He's right, the 'prophet' is right when he sets up a first-rate battery across a street somewhere and blasts away at the innocent and the guilty, without even stooping to explain himself! Obey, trembling creature and—forget your wishes, because—that's none of your business! ... Oh, nothing, nothing will make me forgive the old crone!” His hair was damp with sweat, his trembling lips were parched, his fixed eyes were turned up to the ceiling. “My mother, my sister, how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate them, hate them physically, I cannot bear having them near me...I went over and kissed mother this morning, I remember...To embrace her and think that if she found out, she...should I tell her, then? That would be just like me...Hm! She must be the same as I am,” he added, making an effort to think, as though struggling against the delirium that was taking hold of him. “Oh, how I hate that little old crone now! If she recovered, I think I'd kill her again! Poor Lizaveta! Why did she have to turn up there! ... Strange, though; why is it that I almost never think of her, as if I hadn't killed her?...Lizaveta! Sonya! Poor, meek ones, with meek eyes...Dear ones! ... Why don't they weep? Why don't they moan?...They give everything...their eyes are meek and gentle...Sonya, Sonya! Gentle Sonya! . . .”.

“We keep imagining eternity as an idea that cannot be grasped, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast?

Having risen from insignificance, Pyotr Petrovich had a morbid habit of admiring himself, highly valued his intelligence and abilities, and sometimes, alone with himself, even admired his own face in the mirror. But most of all in the world he loved and valued his money, acquired by labor and various means: it made him equal to all that was higher than himself.

In deepest secret, he entertained rapturous thoughts of a well-behaved and poor girl (she must be poor), very young, very pretty, well born and educated, very intimidated, who had experienced a great many misfortunes and was utterly cowed before him, a girl who would all her life regard him as her salvation, stand in awe of him, obey him, wonder at him and at him alone.

“I was not bowing to you, I was bowing to all human suffering,”.

“and most of all you are a sinner because you destroyed yourself and betrayed yourself in vain.

“Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind...”.

Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?’”.

She went on looking at him, understanding nothing. She understood only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.

“What can be done? Smash what needs to be smashed, once and for all, and that's it—and take the suffering upon ourselves! What? You don't understand? You'll understand later...Freedom and power, but above all, power! Over all trembling creatures, over the whole ant-heap! ... That is the goal! Remember it! This is my parting word to you! I may be talking to you for the last time. If I don't come tomorrow, you'll hear about everything yourself, and then remember these present words. And sometime later, years later, as life goes on, maybe you'll understand what they meant. But if I come tomorrow, I'll tell you who killed Lizaveta. Good-bye!”.

He read everything in that one glance of hers. So she really had already thought of it herself. Perhaps many times, in despair, she had seriously considered how to end it all at once, so seriously, indeed, that now she was almost not surprised at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words (nor had she noticed, of course, the meaning of his reproaches, or his special view of her shame—that was obvious to him). But he fully understood the monstrous pain she suffered, and had long been suffering, at the thought of her dishonorable and shameful position. What, he wondered, what could so far have kept her from deciding to end it all at once? And only here did he understand fully what these poor little orphaned children meant to her, and this pitiful, half-crazed Katerina Ivanovna, with her consumption, and her beating her head against the wall.

It's necessary finally to reason seriously and directly, and not weep and cry like a child that God will not allow it!.

Us—that is, in our Russia, sir, and most of all in our Petersburg circles—if two intelligent men get together, not very well acquainted yet, but, so to speak, mutually respecting each other, just like you and me now, sir, it will take them a whole half hour to find a topic of conversation—they freeze before each other, they sit feeling mutually embarrassed.

Each of them was watching the other, but as soon as their eyes met, quick as lightning they would look away.

“it will keep, it will keep, sir, and it's all just trifles, sir!.

Human nature is a mirror, sir, the clearest mirror! Look and admire—there.

The black serpent of stung vanity had sucked all night at his heart.

Had it been possible right then to kill Raskolnikov merely by wishing, Pyotr Petrovich would immediately have voiced this wish.

He subscribed himself to progress and “our young generations” out of passion. He was one of that numerous and diverse legion of vulgarians, feeble miscreates, half-taught petty tyrants who make a point of instantly latching on to the most fashionable current idea, only to vulgarize it at once, to make an instant caricature of everything they themselves serve, sometimes quite sincerely.

Whiskers...Every human being, I hope, is allowed to defend his own person.

Environment is everything, and man himself is nothing.

The courts are not so blind...or drunk; they will not believe two notorious atheists, agitators, and freethinkers, accusing me out of personal vengeance, which they, in their foolishness, admit themselves...So, sirs, excuse me!”.

It?...And how is it, how is it that you could give away your last penny, and yet kill in order to rob!.

“You know, Sonya,” he said suddenly, with a sort of inspiration, “you know, I can tell you this much: if I'd killed them only because I was hungry,” he went on, stressing each word, and looking at her mysteriously but sincerely, “I would now be...happy! You should know that!.

“The thing is that I once asked myself this question: how would it have been if Napoleon, for example, had happened to be in my place, and didn't have Toulon, or Egypt, or the crossing of Mont Blanc to start his career, but, instead of all these beautiful and monumental things, had quite simply some ridiculous old crone, a leginstrar's widow, whom on top of that he had to kill in order to filch money from her trunk (for his career, you understand)—well, so, could he have made himself do it if there was no other way out? Wouldn't he have shrunk from it because it was so unmonumental and...and sinful? Well, I tell you, I suffered a terribly long time over this 'question,' so that I was terribly ashamed when I finally realized (somehow all at once) not only that he would not shrink, but that it wouldn't even occur to him that it was unmonumental...and he wouldn't understand at all what there was to shrink from. And if there was indeed no other path for him, he'd up and throttle her before she could make a peep, without a moment's thoughtfulness! ... So I, too...came out of my thoughtfulness...I throttled her...following the example of my authority...And that's exactly how it was! You think it's funny? Yes, Sonya, the funniest thing is that maybe that's precisely how it was . . .”.

“Then I realized, Sonya,” he went on ecstatically, “that power is given only to the one who dares to reach down and take it. Here there is one thing, one thing only: one has only to dare! And then a thought took shape in me, for the first time in my life, one that nobody had ever thought before me! Nobody! It suddenly came to me as bright as the sun: how is it that no man before now has dared or dares yet, while passing by all this absurdity, quite simply to take the whole thing by the tail and whisk it off to the devil! I... I wanted to dare, and I killed...I just wanted to dare, Sonya, that's the whole reason!”.

You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter?.

Brought something, I'd eat; if not, the day would go by; I purposely didn't ask, out of spite. At night there was no light; I used to lie in the dark, rather than earn money for candles. I was supposed to be studying, but I sold my books; and on my table, on my papers and notebooks, there's a finger-thick layer of dust even now. I liked to lie and think. And I kept on thinking...And I kept on having such dreams, all sorts of strange dreams, there's no point in telling what they were about! Only at the same time I also began imagining...No, that's not right! Again I'm not telling it right! You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter? Then I learned, Sonya, that if one waits for everyone to become smarter, it will take too long...And then I also learned that it will never happen, that people will never change, and no one can remake them, and it's not worth the effort! Yes, it's true! It's their law...A law, Sonya! It's true! ... And I know now, Sonya, that he who is firm and strong in mind and spirit will rule over them!.

You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter?

He who dares much will be right in their eyes. He who can spit on what is greatest will be their lawgiver, and he who dares the most will be the rightest of all! Thus it has been until now, and thus it will always be. Only a blind man can fail to see it!”.

“Don't interrupt me, Sonya! I wanted to prove only one thing to you: that the devil did drag me there then, but afterwards he explained to me that I had no right to go there, because I'm exactly the same louse as all the rest! He made a mockery of me, and so I've come to you now! Welcome your guest! If I weren't a louse, would I have come to you? Listen: when I went to the old woman that time, I went only to try...You should know that!”.

The two were sitting side by side, sad and crushed, as if they had been washed up alone on a deserted shore after a storm. He looked at Sonya and felt how much of her love was on him, and, strangely, he suddenly felt it heavy and painful to be loved like that. Yes, it was a strange and terrible feeling! On his way to see Sonya, he had felt she was his only hope and his only way out; he had thought he would be able to unload at least part of his torment; but now, suddenly, when her whole heart turned to him, he suddenly felt and realized that he was incomparably more unhappy than he had been before.

Putting it negatively, the myth of eternal return states that a life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance, and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean nothing. We need take no more note of it than of a war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century, a war that altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a hundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment.

There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.

If the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French historians would be less proud of Robespierre. But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody years of the Revolution have turned into mere words, theories, and discussions, have become lighter than feathers, frightening no one. There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.

In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.

This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted.

Not long ago, I caught myself experiencing a most incredible sensation. Leafing through a book on Hitler, I was touched by some of his portraits: they reminded me of my childhood. I grew up during the war; several members of my family perished in Hitler's concentration camps; but what were their deaths compared with the memories of a lost period in my life, a period that would never return? This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted.

It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make.

It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That is why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das schwerste Gewicht).

If every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross. It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That is why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das schwerste Gewicht).

But is heaviness truly deplorable and lightness splendid?.

But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man's body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.

Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.

If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life.

Should he call her back to Prague for good? He feared the responsibility. If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life.

What could it have been if not love declaring itself to him?.

His unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life!.

And he was distressed that in a situation where a real man would instantly have known how to act, he was vacillating and therefore depriving the most beautiful moments he had ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) of their meaning.

He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he wanted was actually quite natural.

We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, "sketch" is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.

What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.

He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life.

He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life. She was neither mistress nor wife. She was a child whom he had taken from a bulrush basket that had been daubed with pitch and sent to the riverbank of his bed.

He smelled the delicate aroma of her fever and breathed it in, as if trying to glut himself with the intimacy of her body.

He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.

How had he come to make such a sudden decision when for nearly a fortnight he had wavered so much that he could not even bring himself to send a postcard asking her how she was?.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor. He tried to design his life in such a way that no woman could move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed. Even though it was wide enough, Tomas would tell his mistresses that he was unable to fall asleep with anyone next to him, and drive them home after midnight.

Again it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket and sent downstream. He couldn't very well let a basket with a child in it float down a stormy river!.

Tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous. Metaphors are not to be trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love.

Why should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single improvident night, than for any other? He would be scrupulous about paying support; he just.

Why should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single improvident night, than for any other?.

He would tell his mistresses: the only relationship that can make both partners happy is one in which sentimentality has no place and neither partner makes any claim on the life and freedom of the other.

"The important thing is to abide by the rule of threes. Either you see a woman three times in quick succession and then never again, or you maintain relations over the years but make sure that the rendezvous are at least three weeks apart.".

"The reason I like you," she would say to him, "is you're the complete opposite of kitsch. In the kingdom of kitsch you would be a monster.".

He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life.

He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life. He did not want word to get out that Tereza was sleeping at his place: spending the night together was the corpus delicti of love.

Though it was not far from the truth, he never dared tell them the whole truth: after making love he had an uncontrollable craving to be by 14   himself; waking in the middle of the night at the side of an alien body was distasteful to him, rising in the morning with an intruder repellent; he had no desire to be overheard brushing his teeth in the bathroom, nor was he enticed by the thought of an intimate breakfast.

But as he ran through the previous few hours in his mind, he began to sense an aura of hitherto unknown happiness emanating from them.

She flung it open and continued to follow him, convinced in her sleep that he meant to leave her for good and she had to stop him.

Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).

Not a day went by without her learning something about his secret life.

We need not look far for an interpretation: in Czech slang the word "cat" means a pretty woman.

In languages that derive from Latin, "compassion" means: we cannot look on coolly as others suffer; or, we sympathize with those who suffer. Another word with approximately the same meaning, "pity" (French, pitie; Italian, pieta; etc.), connotes a certain condescension towards the sufferer. "To take pity on a woman" means that we are better off than she, that we stoop to her level, lower ourselves. That is why the word "compassion" generally inspires suspicion; it designates what is considered an inferior, second-rate sentiment that has little to do with love. To love someone out of compassion means not really to love. In languages that form the word "compassion" not from the root "suffering" but from the root "feeling," the word is used in approximately the same way, but to contend that it designates a bad or inferior sentiment is difficult. The secret strength of its etymology floods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion (co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other's misfortune but also to feel with him any emotion—joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. This kind of compassion (in the sense of souc/r, wspofczucie, Mitgefuhl, medkansia) therefore signifies the maximal capacity of affective imagination, the art of emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of sentiments, then, it is supreme.

If Tereza had been any other woman, Tomas would never have spoken to her again.

He was now afraid to come home late, because Tereza would be waiting up for him.

"You seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings," she said. "The meeting of two worlds. A double exposure. Showing through the outline of Tomas the libertine, incredibly, the face of a romantic lover. Or, the other way, through a Tristan, always thinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine.".

"It is entirely possible," said Tomas, "that a female dog addressed continually by a male name will develop lesbian tendencies.".

But no carnival can go on forever.

A person who longs to leave the place where he lives is an unhappy person.

He took some sleeping pills but still did not close his eyes until morning.

The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well.

The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well. No one was forcing him into a decision. He felt no need to stare at the walls of the houses across the courtyard and ponder whether to live with her or not. Tereza had made the decision herself.

He went to a restaurant for lunch. He was depressed, but as he ate, his original desperation waned, lost its strength, and soon all that was left was melancholy. Looking back on the years he had spent with her, he came to feel that their story could have had no better ending. If someone had invented the story, this is how he would have had to end it. One day Tereza came to him uninvited. One day she left the same way. She came with a heavy suitcase. She left with a heavy suitcase. He paid the bill, left the restaurant, and started walking through the streets, his melancholy growing more and more beautiful. He had spent seven years of life with Tereza, and now he realized that those years were more attractive in retro- 30 spect than they were when he was living them. His love for Tereza was beautiful, but it was also tiring: he had constantly had to hide things from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her evidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her dreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared and only the beauty remained. Saturday found him for the first time strolling alone through Zurich, breathing in the heady smell of his freedom. New adventures hid around each corner. The future was again a secret. He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was. For seven years he had lived bound to her, his every step subject to her scrutiny. She might as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. He soared. He had entered Parmenides' magic field: he was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.

The future was again a secret.

He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was.

He was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.

He tried to remind himself. Don't think about her! Don't think about her! He said to himself, I'm sick with compassion. It's good that she's gone and that I'll never see her again, though it's not Tereza I need to be free of—it's that sickness, compassion, which I thought I was immune to until she infected me with.

For there is nothing heavier than compassion.

For there is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.

And Tomas refused to allow anyone an opportunity to think ill of her.

Unlike Parmenides, Beethoven apparently viewed weight as something positive.

The weighty resolution is at one with the voice of Fate ("Es muss sein!"); necessity, weight, and value are three concepts inextricably bound: only necessity is heavy, and only what is heavy has value.

We believe that the greatness of man stems from the fact that he bears his fate as Atlas bore the heavens on his shoulders. Beethoven's hero is a lifter of metaphysical weights.

Any schoolboy can do experiments in the physics laboratory to test various scientific hypotheses. But man, because he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to follow his passion (compassion) or not.

Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. They had been talking about his friend Z. when she announced, "If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him." Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men.

We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel that Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing the "Es muss sein!" to our own great love.

Tomas often thought of Tereza's remark about his friend Z. and came to the conclusion that the love story of his life exemplified not "Es muss sein! " (It must be so), but rather "Es konnte auch anders sein" (It could just as well be otherwise).

He had gone back to Prague because of her. So fateful a decision resting on so fortuitous a love, a love that would not even have existed had it not been for the chief surgeon's sciatica seven years earlier. And that woman, that personification of absolute fortuity, now again lay asleep beside him, breathing deeply.

The body was a cage, and inside that cage was something which looked, listened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that remainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul.

A long time ago, man would listen in amazement to the sound of regular beats in his chest, never suspecting what they were. He was unable to identify himself with so alien and unfamiliar an object as the body. The body was a cage, and inside that cage was something which looked, listened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that remainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul.

In Tereza's eyes, books were the emblems of a secret brotherhood. For she had but a single weapon against the world of crudity surrounding her: the books she took out of the municipal library, and above all, the novels. She had read any number of them, from Fielding to Thomas Mann. They not only offered the possibility of an imaginary escape from a life she found unsatisfying; they also had a meaning for her as physical objects: she loved to walk down the street with a 47 48 book under her arm. It had the same significance for her as an elegant cane for the dandy a century ago. It differentiated her from others.

The nozzle of the hose supplying oxygen to the lungs was stuffed and red.

The difference between the university graduate and the autodidact lies not so much in the extent of knowledge as in the extent of vitality and self-confidence.

She had come to him to make her body unique, irreplaceable. But he, too, had drawn an equal sign between her and the rest of them: he kissed them all alike, stroked them alike, made no, absolutely no distinction between Tereza's body and the other bodies. He had sent her back into the world she tried to escape, sent her to march naked with the other naked women.

Our dreams prove that to imagine—to dream about things that have not happened—is among mankind's deepest needs.

Anyone whose goal is "something higher" must expect some day to suffer vertigo.

Anyone whose goal is "something higher" must expect some day to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we feel it even when the observation tower comes 60 equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vertigo is something other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.

"Pick me up," is the message of a person who keeps falling.

If you live only for your husband, you have no life of your own.".

In spite of their love, they had made each other's life a hell. The fact that they loved each other was merely proof that the fault lay not in themselves, in their behavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their incompatibility: he was strong and she was weak. She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of a sentence; she was like her country, which stuttered, gasped for breath, could not speak.

But when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave.

His mistress, who had a flexible schedule, accompanied him on all speaking engagements, real and imagined.

Franz was sad. He had grown so accustomed to linking their love life to foreign travel that his "Let's go to Palermo!" was an unambiguous erotic message and her "I prefer Geneva" could have only one meaning: his mistress no longer desired him.

Then why did he worry daily that his mistress was about to leave him?.

It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner.

The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner.

The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well.

He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defense against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow.

True, he would rather have slept by himself, but the marriage bed is still the symbol of the marriage bond, and symbols, as we know, are inviolable.

She could not take much with her when she emigrated, and taking this bulky, impractical thing meant giving UP other, more practical ones.

To rebel against being born a woman seemed as foolish to her as to take pride in it.

What we have not chosen we cannot consider either our merit or our failure.

Not every woman was worthy of being called a woman.

He was not particularly fond of Marie-Claude, but he was very much taken with her love. He felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow. He bowed so low that he married her. And even though Marie-Claude never recaptured the emotional intensity that accompanied her suicide threat, in his heart he kept its memory alive with the thought that he must never hurt her and always respect the woman in her.

The day his father left, Franz and his mother went into town together, and as they left home Franz noticed that her shoes did not match. He was in a quandary: he wanted to point out her mistake, but was afraid he would hurt her. So during the two hours they spent walking through the city together he kept his eyes fixed on her feet. It was then he had his first inkling of what it means to suffer.

He loved her from the time he was a child until the time he accompanied her to the cemetery; he loved her in his memories 91 as well. That is what made him feel that fidelity deserved pride of place among the virtues: fidelity gave a unity to lives that would otherwise splinter into thousands of split-second impressions.

Betrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher that betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. But what is betrayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. Betrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown. Sabina knew of nothing more magnificent than going off into the unknown.

But if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we have placated A.

No one can get really drunk on a novel or a painting, but who can help getting drunk on Beethoven's Ninth, Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, or the Beatles' White Album?.

"It's a vicious circle," Sabina said. "People are going deaf because music is played louder and louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still.".

She was thinking of the days of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless snow-covered plain of silence.

They were sitting together at a restaurant, and loud music with a heavy beat poured out of a nearby speaker as they ate. "It's a vicious circle," Sabina said. "People are going deaf because music is played louder and louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still." "Don't you like music?" Franz asked. "No," said Sabina, and then added, "though in a different era..." She was thinking of the days of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless snow-covered plain of silence.

She discovered that the transformation of music into noise was a planetary process by which mankind was entering the historical phase of total ugliness.

He recalled the noisy music at dinner and said to himself, "Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words." And suddenly he realized that all his life he had done nothing but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for formulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings were obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling through his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he yearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, absolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, overpowering, window-rattling din to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the futility, the vanity of words. Music was the negation of sentences, music was the anti-word! He yearned for one long embrace with Sabina, yearned never to say another sentence, another word, to let his orgasm fuse with the orgiastic thunder of music. And lulled by that blissful imaginary uproar, he fell asleep.

Seeing is limited by two borders: strong light, which blinds, and total darkness. Perhaps that was what motivated Sabina's distaste for all extremism. Extremes mean borders beyond which life ends, and a passion for extremism, in art and in politics, is a veiled longing for death.

(Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!).

That darkness was pure, perfect, thoughtless, visionless; that darkness was without end, without borders; that darkness was the infinite we each carry within us. (Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!).

A man with closed eyes is a wreck of a man.

But for her, darkness did not mean infinity; for her, it meant a disagreement with what she saw, the negation of what was seen, the refusal to see.

These reports have nothing to do with artistic talent, kicking ability, or maladies that respond well to salt sea air; they deal with one thing only: the "citizen's political profile" (in other words, what the citizen says, what he thinks, how he behaves, how he acquits himself at meetings or May Day parades). Because everything (day-to-day existence, promotion at work, vacations) depends on the outcome of the assessment process, everyone (whether he wants to play soccer for the national team, have an exhibition, or spend his holidays at the seaside) must behave in such a way as to deserve a favorable assessment.

All of them had index fingers slightly longer than their middle fingers and pointed them at whomever they happened to be talking to.

The only thing they were all able to understand was the flames, the glory of the flames when he was burned at the stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the essence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more.

Or great men? Jan Hus? None of the people in that room had ever read a line of his works.

The only things that held them together were their defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one another.

She had an overwhelming desire to tell him, like the most banal of women, Don't let me go, hold me tight, make me your plaything, your slave, be strong! But they were words she could not say. The only thing she said when he released her from his embrace was, "You don't know how happy I am to be with you." That was the most her reserved nature allowed her to express.

Franz felt his book life to be unreal. He yearned for real life, for the touch of people walking side by side with him, for their shouts. It never occurred to him that what he considered unreal (the work he did in the solitude of the office or library) was in fact his real life, whereas the parades he imagined to be reality were nothing but theater, dance, carnival—in other words, a dream.

"A philosopher once wrote that everything in my work is unverifiable speculation and called me a 'pseudo-Socrates.' I felt terribly humiliated and made a furious response. And just think, that laughable episode was the greatest conflict I've ever experienced! The pinnacle of the dramatic possibilities available to my life! We live in two different dimensions, you and I. You came into my life like Gulliver entering the land of the Lilliputians.".

"When a society is rich, its people don't need to work with their hands; they can devote themselves to activities of the spirit. We have more and more universities and more and more students. If students are going to earn degrees, they've got to come up with dissertation topics. And since dissertations can be written about everything under the sun, the number of topics is infinite. Sheets of paper covered with words pile up in archives sadder than cemeteries, because no one ever visits them, not even on All Souls' Day. Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities.".

Cemeteries in Bohemia are like gardens. The graves are covered with grass and colorful flowers. Modest tombstones are lost in the greenery. When the sun goes down, the cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a children's ball. Yes, a children's ball, because the dead are as innocent as children. No matter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, in Hitler's time, in Stalin's time, through all occupations. When she felt low, she would get into the car, leave Prague far behind, and walk through one or another of the country cemeteries she loved so well. Against a backdrop of blue hills, they were as beautiful as a lullaby.

"Really, there are books meant for daytime reading and books that can be read only at night.".

"Will you tell me why you're whistling? " Franz whispered. "Because I don't like to hear people talk about politics," she answered out loud.

But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak.

But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak. Franz's weakness is called goodness. Franz would never give Sabina orders. He would never command her, as Tomas had, to lay the mirror on the floor and walk back and forth on it naked. Not that he lacks sensuality; he simply lacks the strength to give orders. There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. Physical love is unthinkable without violence.

Enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating.

What does it mean to live in truth? Putting it negatively is easy enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating.

Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses everything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. That was why Sabina did not suffer in the least from having to keep her love secret. On the contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.

For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barriers between the private and the public.

The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to the soul.

What must be must be.

And at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly unhappy. Sabina's physical presence was much less important than he had suspected. What was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life and no one could ever remove.

Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had slipped him Hercules' broom, and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out of his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a new life—these were the gifts she had left him.

She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.

But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray?.

But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray? Sabina felt emptiness all around her. What if that emptiness was the goal of all her betrayals?.

The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.

He informed her of the deaths of Tomas and Tereza.

When graves are covered with stones, the dead can no longer get out.

The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, "Stay where you are!".

The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, "Stay where you are!" That made Sabina think about her father's grave. There was soil above his grave with flowers growing out of it and a maple tree reaching down to it, and the roots and flowers offered his corpse a path out of the grave. If her father had been covered with a stone, she would never have been able to communicate with him after he died, and hear his voice in the trees pardoning her.

Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used.

Intersect with the music of the other.

The music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other.

Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used. Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other. But it was too late now.

Yes, it was too late, and Sabina knew she would leave Paris, move on, and on again, because were she to die here they would cover her up with a stone, and in the mind of a woman for whom no place is home the thought of an end to all flight is unbearable.

He nourished the cult of Sabina more as religion than as love.

Sometimes when they were alone in his flat together, the girl would lift her eyes from a book, throw him an inquiring glance, and say, "What are you thinking about?" Sitting in his armchair, staring up at the ceiling, Franz always found some plausible response, but in fact he was thinking of Sabina.

The only thing she could not quite fathom was the curious sympathy he had for the countries occupied by the Russian empire.

People use filthy language all day long, but when they turn on the radio and hear a well-known personality, someone they respect, saying "fuck" in every sentence, they feel somehow let down.

A concentration camp is a world in which people live crammed together constantly, night and day. Brutality and violence are merely secondary (and not in the least indispensable) characteristics. A concentration camp is the complete obliteration of privacy.

And if various parts of her body began to grow and shrink and Tereza no longer looked like herself, would she still be herself, would she still be Tereza?.

The only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate.

The only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers. A question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breached. In other words, it is questions with no answers that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human existence.).

What is flirtation? One might say that it is behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, while preventing that possibility from becoming a certainty. In other words, flirting is a promise of sexual intercourse without a guarantee.

Tomas kept trying to convince her that love and lovemaking were two different things. She refused to understand.

She knew that she had become a burden to him: she took things too seriously, turning everything into a tragedy, and failed to grasp the lightness and amusing insignificance of physical love. How she wished she could learn lightness!.

Toilets in modern water closets rise up from the floor like white water lilies. The architect does all he can to make the body forget how paltry it is, and to make man ignore what happens to his intestinal wastes after the water from the tank flushes them down the drain. Even though the sewer pipelines reach far into our houses with their tentacles, they are carefully hidden from view, and we are happily ignorant of the invisible Venice of shit underlying our bathrooms, bedrooms, dance halls, and parliaments.

People usually escape from their troubles into the future; they draw an imaginary line across the path of time, a line beyond which their current troubles will cease to exist.

She, on the other hand, awoke with great reluctance with a desire to stave off the day by keeping her eyes closed.

It lacked the power to become the only body in Tomas's life.

"I can't take it anymore, Tomas. I know I shouldn't complain. Ever since you came back to Prague for me, I've forbidden myself to be jealous. I don't want to be jealous. I suppose I'm just not strong enough to stand up to it. Help me, please!".

Tereza knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul; the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice.

"They need to trap people," the ambassador went on, "to force them to collaborate and set other traps for other people, so that gradually they can turn the whole nation into a single organization of informers.".

The criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise.

The criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.

Anyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the work of criminals is overlooking a basic truth: the criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.

The main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?.

The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one.

A man who chooses to be a politician, say, voluntarily makes the public his judge, with the naive assurance that he will gain its favor.

How defenseless we are in the face of flattery!.

When you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you have a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere.

It is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police.

It is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police. We do not know how to lie.

Insofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-seated desires that orient them to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is different. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of beyond. An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the rest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to do with talent, which goes deeper than talent, no one can become an actor. Similarly, a doctor is someone who consents to spend his life involved with human bodies and all that they entail. That basic consent (and not talent or skill) enables him to enter the dissecting room during the first year of medical school and persevere for the requisite number of years.

Certain Dembscher owed Beethoven fifty florins, and when the composer, who was chronically short of funds, reminded him of the debt, Dembscher heaved a mournful sigh and said, "Muss es sein?" To which Beethoven replied, with a hearty laugh, "Es muss sein!" and immediately jotted down these words and their melody. On this realistic motif he then composed a canon for four voices: three voices sing "Es muss sein, es muss sein, ja, ja, ja, ja!" (It must be, it must be, yes, yes, yes, yes!), and the fourth voice chimes in with "Heraus mit dem Beutel!" (Out with the purse!).

"Well, two hundred, give or take a few.".

Each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it is an originality that demonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of value to come of.

The brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful.

He was in the situation of a chess player who cannot avoid checkmate and is forced to resign. Whether he signed the petition or not made not the slightest difference. It would alter nothing in his own life or in the lives of the political prisoners.

"Some ideas have the force of a bomb exploding.".

The Communists have the excuse that Stalin misled them. Murderers have the excuse that their mothers didn't love them. And suddenly you come out and say: there is no excuse. No one could be more innocent, in his soul and conscience, than Oedipus. And yet he punished himself when he saw what he had done.".

This is the image from which he was born. As I have pointed out before, characters are not born like people, of woman; they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor containing in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has discovered or said something essential about. But isn't it true that an author can write only about himself? Staring impotently across a courtyard, at a loss for what to do; hearing the pertinacious rumbling of one's own stomach during a moment of love; betraying, yet lacking the will to abandon the glamorous path of betrayal; raising one's fist with the crowds in the Grand March; displaying one's wit before hidden microphones—I have known all these situations, I have experienced them myself, yet none of them has given rise to the person my curriculum vitae and I represent. The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It is that crossed border (the border beyond which my own "I" ends) which attracts me most. For beyond that border begins the secret the novel asks about. The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the trap the world has become. But enough.

Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision; we are not granted a second, third, or fourth life in which to compare various decisions.

What happens but once might as well not have happened at all.

History is as light as individual human life, unbearably light, light as a feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow.

Somewhere out in space there was a planet where all people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on earth and of all the experience they had amassed here.

Somewhere out in space there was a planet where all people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on earth and of all the experience they had amassed here. And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives.

And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives. And perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one degree (one life) more mature.

And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives. And perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one degree (one life) more mature. That was Tomas's version of eternal return.

The Minister of Culture, from whom the poet did everything possible to hide, did not catch up with Hrubin until his funeral, when he made a speech over the grave about the poet's love for the Soviet Union. Perhaps he hoped his words would ring so outrageously false that they would wake Hrubin from the dead. But the world was too ugly, and no one decided to rise up out of the grave.

If excitement is a mechanism our Creator uses for His own amusement, love is something that belongs to us alone and enables us to flee the Creator. Love is our freedom. Love lies beyond "Es muss sein!".

Attaching love to sex is one of the most bizarre ideas the Creator ever had.

People were hermaphrodites until God split them in two, 239 and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost.

"What are you looking at?" she asked. 240 He knew that instead of waking her he should lull her back to sleep, so he tried to come up with an answer that would plant the image of a new dream in her mind. "I'm looking at the stars," he said. "Don't say you're looking at the stars. That's a lie. You're looking down." "That's because we're in an airplane. The stars are below us." "Oh, in an airplane," said Tereza, squeezing his hand even tighter and falling asleep again. And Tomas knew that Tereza was looking out of the round window of an airplane flying high above the stars.

Stalin's son had a hard time of it. All evidence points to the conclusion that his father killed the woman by whom he had the boy. Young Stalin was therefore both the Son of God (because his father was revered like God) and His cast-off. People feared him twofold: he could injure them by both his wrath (he was, after all, Stalin's son) and his favor (his father might punish his cast-off son's friends in order to punish him). Rejection and privilege, happiness and woe—no one felt more concretely than Yakov how interchangeable opposites are, how short the step from one pole of human existence to the other.

When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall.

Can proximity cause vertigo? It can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall.

Can proximity cause vertigo? It can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall. If rejection and privilege are one and the same, if there is no difference between the sublime and the paltry, if the Son of God can undergo judgment for shit, then human existence loses its dimensions and becomes unbearably light.

The Germans who sacrificed their lives to expand their country's territory to the east, the Russians who died to extend their country's power to the west—yes, they died for something idiotic, and their deaths have no meaning or general validity.

Valentinus resolved the damnable dilemma by claiming that Jesus "ate and drank, but did not defecate.".

Shit is a more onerous theological problem than is evil. Since God gave man freedom, we can, if need be, accept the idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes. The responsibility for shit, however, rests entirely with Him, the Creator of man.

There was pleasure in Paradise, but no excitement.

As long as man was allowed to remain in Paradise, either (like Valentinus' Jesus) he did not defecate at all, or (as would seem more likely) he did not look upon shit as something repellent.

Man began to hide what shamed him, and by the time he removed the veil, he was blinded by a great light. Thus, immediately after his introduction to disgust, he was introduced to excitement. Without shit (in both the literal and figurative senses of the word), there would be no sexual love as we know it, accompanied by pounding heart and blinded senses.

The dispute between those who believe that the world was created by God and those who think it came into being of its own accord deals with phenomena that go beyond our reason and experience. Much more real is the line separating those who doubt being as it is granted to man (no matter how or by whom) from those who accept it without reservation.

The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation.

The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation. Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in which case don't lock yourself in the bathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner.

Kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word;.

"Kitsch" is a German word born in the middle of the sentimental nineteenth century, and from German it entered all Western languages. Repeated use, however, has obliterated its original metaphysical meaning: kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence.

The model of Communist kitsch is the ceremony called May Day.

Kitsch may not, therefore, depend on an unusual situation; it must derive from the basic images people have engraved in their memories: the ungrateful daughter, the neglected father, children running on the grass, the motherland betrayed, first love.

Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children running on the grass! The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! It is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch.

Soviet society had made such progress that the basic conflict was no longer between good and evil but between good and better.

The greatest conflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers' misunderstanding: he thought she no longer loved him; she thought he no longer loved her. But in the final scene they would fall into each other's arms, tears of happiness trickling down their cheeks.

All her life she had proclaimed kitsch her enemy. But hadn't she in fact been carrying it with her?.

Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right. Yet to define one or the other by means of the theoretical principles it professes is all but impossible. And no wonder:.

Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right.

"Would you be terribly upset if I went on the march?" he asked the girl with the glasses, who counted every day away from him a loss, yet could not deny him a thing.

How can it be that leftist intellectuals (because the doctor with the mustache was nothing if not a leftist intellectual) are willing to march against the interests of a Communist country when Communism has always been considered the left's domain?.

When the crimes of the country called the Soviet Union became too scandalous, a leftist had two choices: either to spit on his former life and stop marching or (more or less sheepishly) to reclassify the Soviet Union as an obstacle to the Grand March and march on.

Then there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation of people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the room will go dark. Tereza and Tomas belong in the third category.

We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under. The first category longs.

We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under.

The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, in other words, for the look of the public.

He had the feeling that the atmosphere was suddenly a hundred times thinner. Nothing could replace the look of unknown eyes. He thought he would suffocate. Then one day he realized that he was constantly being followed, bugged, and surreptitiously photographed in the street. Suddenly he had anonymous eyes on him and he could breathe 270 again! He began making theatrical speeches to the microphones in his wall. In the police, he had found his lost public.

The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. They are happier than the people in the first category, who, when they lose their public, have the feeling that the lights have gone out in the room of their lives. This happens to nearly all of them sooner or later. People in the second category, on the other hand, can always come up with the eyes they need.

And finally there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers. Franz, for example. He traveled to the borders of Cambodia only for Sabina. As the bus bumped along the Thai road, he could feel her eyes fixed on him in a long stare.

"Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric.".

"Forgive them, for they know not what they do.".

The words that made the biggest impression on him were "Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric." When his girlfriend's uncle put a Bible in his hands, he was particularly struck by Jesus' words "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." He knew that his father was a nonbeliever, but in the similarity of the two phrases he saw a secret sign: his father agreed with the path he had taken.

Tereza and Tomas had died under the sign of weight. She wanted to die under the sign of lightness.

He had come to find out once and for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl with the glasses was his real life, his only real life! He had come to find out that reality was more than a dream, much more than a dream!.

When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object.

(because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself);.

It follows, then, that the true opponent of totalitarian kitsch is the person who asks questions. A question is like a knife that slices through the stage backdrop and gives us a look at what lies hidden behind it.

Fully to the mistress she herself had sent to him?.

Sabina who had made him feel so small.

In death, Franz at last belonged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never belonged to her before.

In death, Franz at last belonged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never belonged to her before. Marie-Claude took care of everything: she saw to the funeral, sent out the announcements, bought the wreaths, and had a black dress made—a wedding dress, in reality. Yes, a husband's funeral is a wife's true wedding! The climax of her life's work! The reward for her sufferings!.

Tomas had longed for a world in which justice would reign.

Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and decent man. How else can you explain that crazy, desperate trip to wherever it was in Asia?.

Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and decent man. How else can you explain that crazy, desperate trip to wherever it was in Asia? He went there to find death.

And so on and so forth. Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is the stopover between being and oblivion.

What remains of Franz? An inscription reading A RETURN AFTER LONG WANDERINGS.

What remains of Tomas? An inscription reading HE WANTED THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH.

Life in the country was the only escape open to them, because only in the country was there a constant deficit of people and a surplus of living accommodations.

Farmer who no longer owns his own land and is merely a laborer tilling the soil forms no allegiance to either region or work; he has nothing to lose, nothing to fear for. As a result of such apathy, the countryside had maintained more than a modicum of autonomy and freedom.

Who can tell what distances he covered on his way back? Who knows what phantoms he battled?.

The very beginning of Genesis tells us that God created man in order to give him dominion over fish and fowl and all creatures.

But the major drive was directed against dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but radio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets and parks, endanger our children's health,.

But the major drive was directed against dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but radio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets and parks, endanger our children's health, fulfill no useful function, yet must be fed.

We can never establish with certainty what part of our relations with others is the result of our emotions—love, antipathy, charity, or malice—and what part is predetermined by the constant power play among individuals.

She did not wish to claim that they could love each other more. Her feeling was rather that, given the nature of the human couple, the love of man and woman is a priori inferior to that which can exist (at least in the best instances) in the love between man and dog, that oddity of human history probably unplanned by the Creator.

It is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company.

Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.

His look of awful trust did not last long; he soon laid his head back down on his paws. Tereza knew that no one ever again would look at her like that.

(Oh, how horrible that we actually dream ahead to the death of those we love!).

Whenever a camera is in the offing, they immediately run to the nearest child, lift it in the air, kiss it on the cheek. Kitsch is the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements.

When I say "totalitarian," what I mean is that everything 252 that infringes on kitsch must be banished for life: every display of individualism (because a deviation from the collective is a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (because in the realm of kitsch everything must be taken quite seriously); and the mother who abandons her family or the man who prefers men to women, thereby calling into question the holy decree "Be fruitful and multiply.".

True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.


# Silman's Complete Endgame Course: From Beginner to Master (Silman, Jeremy)

“Amazingly enough, I have not yet found a single endgame manual which I could recommend wholeheartedly to my pupils. Most existing books are either elementary and useful for novices only, or are useless methodologically, or do not cover endgame theory fully.”.

Jumping from book to book is a fast track to nowhere.

After mastering the material there, put the book away and spend your time studying tactics and a few strategic concepts.

For example, I heretically decided not to include Bishop and Knight vs. Lone King because it’s far from easy to master, and it occurs very rarely in over-the-board play.

Think about it: an hour of work for a lifetime of endgame confidence.

“nobody ever won a game by resigning.”.

Beginners only need to be aware of two endgame situations: Overkill Mates (one side has an enormous amount of material versus the lone enemy King) and Stalemates (one side has no legal moves, but is not in check).

When you are up by a Queen and a Rook, or even by two Queens (or more!), one must wonder if your opponent (who could give up and show a bit of respect) is bullheaded or simply enjoys suffering and/or pain. Whatever his reasons for continuing might be, you are the one who must now demonstrate how easy it is to score the victory.

Trust me, nobody cares if you mate in three or five, as long as you succeed every time!).

As in almost all mating endgames, you need to push the enemy King to one of the four sides of the board. The point of the Staircase is to use one major piece (Rook or Queen) to keep the enemy King from stepping onto a rank or file. Then the other major piece will give check along the next rank or file, forcing the target King to step closer to its doom on the side of the board.

However, if you’ve become addicted to endgame study and wish to continue your “technical” education, the following books should prove both useful and enjoyable.

This didn’t seem to affect me too much because I lost the vast majority of my games rather quickly and rarely had need of any endgame skills at all.

Here in Part Two, you’ll learn what material advantages do and don’t win, and you’ll take your first step into the world of serious endgame knowledge—you’ll develop an appreciation for the powers of the King, the mysteries of the Opposition, and the drawing proclivities of the rook-pawns.

Two Bishops = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight (5) might never occur in your whole chess lifetime and is far too difficult to waste your precious study time on (in other words, this book won’t examine Bishop and Knight vs. King at all).

White only has a chance to deliver mate in this endgame if black’s King blunders into a mate in one.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame. The truth is, the King is a very strong piece (at least as strong as a Bishop or Knight)! Unfortunately, the terror created by the game’s early phases causes most players to lose sight of this piece’s true worth.

In such a situation it is a disadvantage to have the move since you must give up control of one of the blockade squares (shown by the three Xs in the diagram) and thus allow the opponent a way into your position.

When your King has to step away from the pawn, always go straight back!.

Yet, the game is a dead draw if Black stops the white King from penetrating to the front of its pawn.

King and rook-pawn vs. lone King: If the defender’s King gets in front of the pawn, the game will always be a draw!.

Whoever moves with an odd number of squares between the Kings does not have the Opposition (it’s the same in basic Opposition situations: one/odd square separates the Kings and the person to move doesn’t have the Opposition). Conversely, the person to move with an even number of squares between the Kings does have the Opposition.

In such Opposition battles, you want to have an odd number of squares between the Kings with the other guy to move!.

In this type of situation, the rule is to make a square or a rectangle in which each corner is the same color with the other guy to move.

It can be seen that it is not difficult to determine who has the Opposition when the Kings “connect” on a rank, file, or diagonal. But what if they fail to connect altogether?.

Unless the defending King is on vacation elsewhere on the board, the presence of a rook-pawn will make the game a draw.

If you’re trying to win and you can enter a pawn up endgame where you have a rook-pawn, be careful! The words “rook-pawn” and “draw” seem to be bound at the hip!.

Of course, 4...Kf8?? 5.h7, 1-0, would leave us wondering about the state of black’s mental health.

If the defender has it, then the game is a draw. If the stronger side has the Opposition, then the game is won.

When the stronger side gets his King (on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th rank) directly in front of his pawn, the only question that matters is, “Who owns the Opposition?”.

Move as far forward with your King as possible, while always making sure that your pawn is safe!.

Fox in the Chicken Coup refers to a situation where the stronger side’s King (the “fox”) rushes to the other side of the board to feast on helpless enemy pawns (“chickens”) while the defending King is busy dealing with a pawn on the other wing.

“When your King is in front of your pawn, go as far forward as possible until the pawn is in danger.”.

As you can see, a player must always be on the alert for such “freezing” moves!.

In such situations, players sometimes refer to pawns of this nature as “baby Queens” since they have one purpose in life: to reach the end of the board and become an adult!.

If the Knight can take control of any square in front of the pawn, the game is drawn.

A lone Knight can only triumph over a lone pawn if that pawn is a rook-pawn and if its King is trapped in front of it. Why? Because, in certain rare instances, the rook-pawn allows smother mates to occur.

If the enemy pawn is well into its journey towards promotion, and if its King is helping, and if the Rook’s King is off on vacation, then a draw will result.

A pawn on the 5th rank and a King trapped on the 3rd rank by the enemy Rook is always a win for the side with the Rook.

As in all endgames, stalemates play an important part in the defender’s hopes and must always remain in the stronger side’s mind as something to avoid at all costs.

If this doesn’t make any sense, run, don’t walk, to Part Three and read the section on Indirect Opposition again.

If taking the Opposition fails to accomplish the goal of getting the King in front of its pawn, then it’s useless to take the Opposition in the first place.

This rule—if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition, illustrated in Part Three, Diagram 62—only flounders if the pawn is a rook-pawn, or if the pawn is on the 5th rank and its King is on the 6th.

Our oft-repeated rule (i.e., if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition), shockingly, turns out to have two exceptions!.

By now you should know when a basic King and pawn vs. lone King position is lost or drawn.

This kind of position, which can occur with any set of pawns other than rook-pawns (with both Kings in front of their respective pawns), is known as a Trébuchet.

There is not much to learn, since a glance will make things pretty clear: whoever moves is in zugzwang—he is forced to move away from the defense of his pawn, which will result in an obviously lost King and pawn vs. lone King situation. Thus, if White has the move:.

The idea of something definable which can help us understand the right path in seemingly tough positions is an important one, and we’ll be searching for such “crutches” all through this book.

Since black’s King will be closer to the two center pawns (meaning that he can make first contact), White will end up a loser in the coming battle.

In a near (upcoming) Trébuchet position, the side whose King can make first diagonal contact with the enemy pawn can force a winning Trébuchet.

You can often solve seemingly difficult situations by steering the game towards the many basic situations you have mastered.

The ability to see whether or not you or your opponent can gain the Opposition in key moments is extremely important. Successful endgame play is impossible without this skill.

He’s not able to use the “move the King straight back” rule since he’s run out of board!.

In diagram 99, Black’s King was not able to step backwards after the pawn reached e6 and, as a result, he lost.

There is a bit of an optical illusion in diagram 99, so carefully compare the last two positions until the “why” and “how” becomes clear.

If the pawns are healthy and not rook-pawns, King and two pawns vs. a lone King always wins.

King and two (doubled) pawns vs. lone King always win unless the pawns can’t be properly defended, or unless they are rook-pawns.

“Excuse me, but could you kindly move your King away from the front of my pawn?”.

When you possess King and two doubled pawns vs. lone King, don’t push both pawns up the board together since that increases the weaker side’s chances for a lucky stalemate.

If the defender’s King stands on any of the “X” squares the game will be a draw (the position of white’s King won’t change the result).

Can black’s King stop (or even win) the enemy pawn? The game hangs in the balance—if the black King can stop the pawn, then the game is drawn, while the game is lost if the King can’t. The answer lies in a technique called the Square of the Pawn.

After a bit of time the whole Square of the Pawn idea will be an easy and natural part of your chess arsenal.

What is an Outside Passed Pawn? It’s a passed pawn that stands to the side of the main sphere of battle. Such a pawn is usually a very valuable commodity since it can be far from the enemy King and thus pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender.

A Bishop and (safe) non rook-pawn vs. lone King is always a win (finally something makes sense!).

Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn.

Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.

Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth.

Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.


# How to Day Trade for a Living: Tools, Tactics, Money Management, Discipline and Trading Psychology (Aziz, Andrew)

Success in trading is not a revolution, it is an evolution.

In my opinion, the most important lesson that you can learn from reading this book is that you will not get rich quickly by day trading. Day trading is not similar to gambling or playing the lottery. This is the most important misconception that people have about day trading and I hope you will come to the same conclusion after reading this book.

The release of the records of financial brokers. Those records indicated that after six months of trading, only 16% of day traders actually made money.

Those records indicated that after six months of trading, only 16% of day traders actually made money.

Trading in a simulator account is expediting your learning curve exponentially.

And, once you begin trading with your real money, you need to treat it as your job, as your career, and as your profession. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You need to enter each trade with a well-thought-out plan and then stick to it. As I am fond of saying, you need to stick to your trading plans like glue! You cannot allow your emotions to get the better of you in the midst of a trade.

An average successful day trader can make between $500 and $1,000 every day.

I will explain specific reasons behind this important question in Chapters 8 and 9 but, overall, in my opinion, the most common reason that people fail in day trading is that they do not regard it as a serious business.

Others decide to become involved in trading because they think it will be fun or entertaining, or an interesting hobby of some kind. They might be attracted to trading because they consider it a “cool” thing to do, something that will bring them prestige or perhaps make them more attractive to others.

I always advise individuals to budget at least $1,500 for education for their first year. Yes, $1,500 might be a lot of money for one week or one month of training, but over the course of your lifetime, it is a very manageable investment, even for people who are not financially blessed but are ready to begin trading.

It always amazes me when I see people start a new business without proper education and training.

Seek a solid education and practice for at least three months in simulators before trading with real money.

In reality, trading isn't about “always” at all; it is about each situation that presents itself and it is about each individual trade.

When traders are undercapitalized but still hope to trade for a living, they are more likely to take higher risks to achieve their desired returns. That, unfortunately, will most likely destroy their account.

First, you’re looking for stocks that are moving in a relatively predictable manner. Secondly, you are going to trade them in one day. You will not keep any position overnight. If you buy stock in Apple (ticker: AAPL) today, for instance, you will not hold your position overnight and sell it tomorrow. If you hold onto any stock overnight, it is no longer day trading, it’s called swing trading.

Swing trading is a form of trading in which you hold stocks over a period of time, generally from one day to a few weeks. It is a completely different style of trading, and you shouldn’t use the strategies and tools that you use for day trading to do swing trading. Do you remember Rule 2, where I mentioned that day trading is a business? Swing trading is also a business, but a completely different kind of business.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading. We are aware that we are running two different businesses, and we have gone through separate educational programs for these two kinds of trading.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight. For day trading, however, you can trade anything, including companies that will soon go bankrupt, because you don’t care what happens after the market closes. In fact, many of the companies that you will day trade are too risky to hold overnight because they might lose much of their value in that short of a period of time.

Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans. You should never change a day trade that was supposed to close at the end of the day into a swing trade. It’s a common human inclination to accept profits quickly and to also want to wait until losing trades return to even.

When I sit down with them and listen to their expectations, I realize that most of them want to invest their money, they are not looking for a new or additional career as a trader.

How I can make money today is my obsession and my expertise.

Day traders buy stocks in the hope that their price will go higher. This is called buying long , or simply long.

“I am long 100 shares AAPL,” it means that we have bought 100 shares of Apple Inc. and would like to sell them higher for a profit.

Day traders can borrow shares from their broker and sell them, hoping that the price will go lower and that they can then buy those shares back at a lower price and make a profit.

Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up.

Short sellers profit when the price of the stock they borrowed and sold drops. Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up. Fear is a more powerful feeling than greed. Therefore, short sellers, if they trade right, can make astonishing profits while other traders panic and start to sell off.

However, like anything in the market that has great potential, short selling has its risks too. When buying stocks of a company for $5, the worst case scenario is that the company goes bankrupt and you lose your $5 per share. There is a limit to your loss. But if you short sell that company at $5 and then the price, instead of going down, starts going higher and higher, then there won’t be any limit to your loss. The price may go to $10, $20, or $100, and still there will be no limit to your loss. Your broker wants those shares back. Not only can you lose all of the money in your account, but your broker can also sue you for more money if you do not have sufficient funds to cover your shorts.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher. Short sellers are balancing the market and adjusting prices to their reasonable value. Their actions are conducive to the health of the market.

Strategy. Having said that, I am more careful.

Notwithstanding that fact, individual traders have a tremendous advantage over institutional traders. Banks and other institutions are compelled to trade, often in large volumes, and sometimes with little regard to price. They are expected to be constantly active in the market. Individual traders, on the other hand, can decide whether or not they want to trade, and they can bide their time until opportunities present themselves.

One hundred shares is low-risk, and although it’s also a low reward for the trader, you need to start somewhere. New traders should start out with trading 100 shares. If their stop loss hits, they really have no excuse about why they couldn’t get out. Even for an illiquid stock (a stock that is hard to sell) that is traded with very low volume, 100 shares is nothing.

Therefore, you need to find stocks that will make quick moves to the upside or to the downside in a relatively predictable manner.

You will not trade stocks that other retail traders are not trading or not seeing.

The more traders using these strategies, the better they will work. As more people recognize the line in the sand, more people will be buying at that point.

This is why many traders are happy to share their day trading strategies.

I believe one of the most significant challenges with these “black boxes” is that the computer programmers who work so many hours each day on the formulas don’t have a clue how to day trade themselves.

Never forget that in the equally strategic world of chess, Garry Kasparov did win some of his rounds against IBM’s Deep Blue.

Of the various HFT programs that are currently operating, one of the least effective is the so-called “ Buy the New Low” program. When a stock reaches a new intraday low, many day traders will go short to ride the downside momentum. This program then begins to buy the shorts from those day traders to push the price higher. This causes day traders to panic and to cover their shorts. Because the organizations behind HFT programs have almost limitless buying power, the plan sounds flawless. The plan quickly breaks down, however, when another large institutional seller is behind the trade and decides to dump their large positions. This means that regardless of how many shares the program buys, the stock will simply not push higher because institutional sellers and day traders will continue to dump their shares on it.

What works today for traders may not work tomorrow.

For example, when a program forces short sellers to cover fast, ride the short squeeze on the up side with the program.

The market is simply a pattern-solving exercise.

But what we should not do, what a trader must never do, is to make excuses.

As part of the algorithmic trading by computer systems, the majority of the stocks will trend with the overall market unless they have a reason not to.

But, remember, there will be a handful of stocks that will buck the trend of the market because they have a catalyst. These are the Stocks in Play . This is what retail traders are looking for - that small handful of stocks that are going to be running when the markets are tanking, or tanking when the markets are running.

If the market is running, and these stocks are running too, that's fine. You just want to ensure you are trading stocks that are moving because they have a fundamental reason to move and are not just moving with the overall market conditions: Stocks in Play.

When I do reversal trades (Chapter 7), my favorite reversal trades are on stocks that are selling off because there has been some bad news regarding that company.

If there is a quick sell off because of bad news, many people will notice and start monitoring the stock for what is called a Bottom Reversal.

If stocks are trending down with the overall market, such as oil was some time ago, you cannot do a good reversal trade.

Their value pops up by 10 cents, and you think it’s a reversal, but then they are sold off for another 50 cents. They’re selling off because they’re trending with both the overall market and their sector. Oil was a weak sector for a while in 2014 and 2015 and the majority of the oil and energy stocks were selling off. When a sector is weak, that is not a good time to make a reversal trade. That’s where you have to differentiate.

Rule 4: Always ask, “ Is this stock moving because the overall market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst ?”.

That’s when you have to do a little bit of research. As you become more experienced as a trader, you will be able to differentiate between catalyst-based price action and general market trending.

As discussed, as a retail trader, you must be careful that you are not on the wrong side of the trade against institutional traders.

You’re in the wrong place. Focus where everyone else is focused: focus on the stock that is moving every single day and receiving literally a ton of action. That is what day traders will be looking at.

Can you day trade stocks like Apple or Priceline or Coca-Cola or IBM? Of course you can, but these are slow moving stocks that are dominated by institutional traders and algorithmic traders, and in general terms they are going to be very hard to day trade.

As I mentioned earlier, I’m not a value investor and I’m not a long-term investor. I don’t trade Options or Futures either, but I do use Futures to gain an understanding of the overall market direction in the near-term future. I am an intraday equity (stock) trader. I am also a swing trader. In swing trading, I personally do care very much about the fundamentals of the companies I choose to trade: their earnings, dividends, earnings-per-share, and many other criteria. But swing trading is not the focus of this book, so I won’t pursue that topic for now.

I’m also a Forex (foreign exchange market) trader and sometimes I trade commodities and currencies. But, in the mornings, I am mostly an equities day trader and I focus on the real stocks. The majority of day traders don’t trade penny stocks or on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Penny stocks are extremely manipulated and they do not follow any of the rules of the standard strategies. We trade real stocks. Sometimes we may be trading Facebook (ticker: FB) and sometimes we may be trading Apple (ticker: AAPL), but we will always be trading the stocks that are having a big day. You may be surprised, but on almost every single day in the market, there's a stock having a big day because the company has released earnings, had a newsbreak, or had something bad or good happen to it. These are the fundamental catalysts that you must look for.

You will read about it in detail in Chapter 8, but my trading day typically starts at around 6 a.m. (which is 9 a.m. New York time) with pre-market scanning. I’m scanning to see where there is volume in the market. As early as 8:30 a.m. New York time, you’ll know what stocks are gapping up or gapping down. I then start scouring through the news for catalysts that explain the gaps. I start to put together a watchlist (the list of stocks I will monitor during the trading day). I rule some out and then I pick and choose which ones I do and don’t like. By 9:15 a.m. New York time I am in our chatroom, going over my watchlist with all of our traders. By 9:30 a.m., when the bell rings, my plans are ready.

The advantage of having all of that volume is that it provides liquidity. This means there are plenty of buyers and plenty of sellers, which in turn means that you can easily get in and out of trades.

I personally trade only within the first one or two hours of the market’s opening.

I avoid pre-market trading because there is very low liquidity as there are very few traders trading. That means stocks can pop up a dollar, then drop a dollar, and you can’t get in and out with large shares. You have to go really small, and you have to use such small positions that, for me at least, it's just not worth it. If you don't mind trading in small shares, then you can certainly trade pre-market, but you need to first ensure your broker will allow you to do pre-market trading.

The great advantage for me is that I can be finished trading before many of the people in my city are even out of bed.

You know how easy it is to lose money. Once you have some money in your pocket, you should hold on to it.

I’ve learned, and at times the hard way, that success in day trading comes from initially mastering one proven trading strategy, such as what I have devoted Chapter 7 of this book to; knowing how much to properly enter a trade with and knowing when to properly exit a trade, all without risking any more of your hard-earned money than necessary; and, as has been emphasized several times already in this book, controlling your emotions.

Often, beginner traders who fail to make money in the markets get frustrated and go out and try to learn more about how the markets work, study new strategies, adopt additional technical indicators, follow some different traders, and join other chatrooms.

They don’t realize that the main cause of their failure is often a lack of self-discipline, the making of impulsive decisions and sloppy risk and money management, not their technical knowledge.

You are the only problem you will ever have for your trading career and, of course, you are the only solution to this problem.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you. Something completely unexpected can happen in the middle of your trade. Please believe me, there is no magic formula for success.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”. This simple saying says so much about the mindset of a professional trader. If you survive the learning curve, then the good times will come and you can become a consistently profitable trader. But you have to survive. And many just can’t.

A common reason for the failure of new day traders is that they cannot manage their early losses. Accepting profits is easy to do, but it is much more difficult, especially for beginners, to overcome the temptation to wait for losing trades to return to the break-even point. “I just give this trade a bit more room” often they say. Waiting for something that is not likely to happen can result in serious damage to their accounts.

To be a successful trader, not only you must learn excellent risk management rules but also you need to firmly implement them.

You must have a line in the sand that tells you when to get out of a trade.

It’s going to be necessary from time to time to admit defeat and say, “I was wrong,” or “The setup isn’t ready yet,” or “I'm getting out of the way.” And that acknowledgement must come in a timely fashion. Waiting too long to exit a trade can literally wipe out your entire account.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but I still lose frequently. That means I must have found a way to be a really good loser. Lose gracefully. Take the losses and walk away.

If a trade goes against you, exit the trade. In day trading, the unexpected will occur, this is the name of the game. There is always another trade and another day. Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting. I.

Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting.

I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to be a good loser. You have to be able to accept a loss. It’s an integral part of day trading.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.”.

You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.” You do not want to do that. You must follow the rules of your strategy. You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss. You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss.

Every time you trade, you’re exposing yourself to the risk of losing money. How do you minimize that risk? You need to find a good setup and manage the risk with proper share size and stop loss.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.” You do not want to do that. You must follow the rules of your strategy. You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss. You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss. And if you ended up taking an $800 loss, it would be really hard to recover from that. Take the quick losses, get out, and come back when the timing is better.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.

A good setup is an opportunity for you to get into a trade with as little risk as possible. That means you might be risking $100, but you have the potential to make $300. You would call that a 3 to 1 profit-to-loss ratio.

Good traders will not take trades with profit-to-loss ratios of less than 2 to 1. That means if you buy $1,000 worth of stock, and are risking $100 on it, you must sell it for at least $1,200 so you will make at least $200. Of course, if the price comes down to $900, you must accept the loss and exit the trade with only $900 (a $100 loss).

Your stop loss should be at a reasonable technical level.

Any stop loss below VWAP is meaningless in this case, because the stock can make a normal pull back toward VWAP at any time and then continue to sell off toward your target.

You are always looking for opportunities to get low-risk entries with big win potential.

As a beginner trader you may not be able to differentiate between a range of setups. It may be difficult for you to recognize what a home-run Bull Flag is and what will end up being a “false breakout”.

You can learn from videos on YouTube and Google. You can also join our chatroom where I explain my trades in real time while I am trading them. You will be able to observe me, my monitor and my trading platform.

Using a 2 to 1 win:lose ratio, I can be wrong 40% of the time and still make money.

Again, your job as a day trader is managing risk, it is not buying and selling stocks. Your broker is buying and selling stocks for you in the market. Your job is to manage your risk and your account. Whenever you click “buy” in your trading platform, you expose your money to a risk.

Chapter 4 focuses on finding the right Stocks in Play for day trading.

You must avoid stocks that (1) are heavily traded by computers and institutional traders, (2) have small relative trading volume, (3) are penny stocks and are therefore highly manipulated, and (4) don’t have any reason to move (no fundamental catalysts).

If you are targeting $1,000 a day, then 10 or 20 shares might not be enough. You either have to take more shares or increase your account size. If you don’t have enough money to trade for a $1,000 daily target, you should lower your daily goal.

I am holding around $25,000 in my trading account and I usually choose 800 shares to trade. My daily goal is $500 or $120,000/year. That is sufficient for my lifestyle. What is your trading goal?.

That’s right. Milk. 2%. You should never risk more than 2% of your account on any given trade.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000. If you have only been able to save up a modest amount of funds for day trading, then you have no choice but to trade in smaller numbers of shares. Make it one of your unbreakable rules. It will be difficult to move on, but if as you stare at your monitors you see a possible setup that could cost you more than 2% of your trading account, just move on and look for another trade.

If you have only been able to save up a modest amount of funds for day trading, then you have no choice but to trade in smaller numbers of shares. Make it one of your unbreakable rules. It will be difficult to move on, but if as you stare at your monitors you see a possible setup that could cost you more than 2% of your trading account, just move on and look for another trade. With every single trade you make, you should always ensure that at least 98% of your account is protected.

Three-Step Risk Management Step 1: Determine your maximum dollar risk for the trade you’re planning (never more than 2% of your account). Calculate this before your trading day starts. Step 2: Estimate your maximum risk per share, the strategy stop loss, in dollars, from your entry. This comes from the strategies set out in Chapter 7, where I explain in each strategy what the stop loss should be. Step 3: Divide “1” by “2” to find the absolute maximum number of shares you are allowed to trade each time. To better illustrate this, let’s return to the example of MOH from a few pages back. If you have a $40,000 account, the 2% rule will limit your risk on any trade to $800. Let’s assume you want to be conservative and risk only 1% of that account, or $400. That will be Step 1. As you monitor MOH, you see a situation develop where the VWAP Strategy (see Chapter 7) may very well work in your favor. You decide to sell short the stock at $50, and you want to cover them at $48.80, with a stop loss at $50.40. You will be risking $0.40 per share. That will be Step 2 of risk control. For Step 3, calculate your share size by dividing “Step 1” by “Step 2” to find the maximum size you may trade. In this example, you will be allowed to buy a maximum of 1,000 shares.

In this case, you may not have enough cash or buying power to buy 1,000 shares of MOH at $50 (because you have only $40,000 in your account). So instead you will buy 800 shares or, perhaps, even 500 shares. Remember, you can always risk less, but you are not allowed to risk more than 2% of your account under any circumstance.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If break of moving average will yield a $600 loss, and you have set a $400 maximum loss per trade, then you should either take fewer shares in that trade or not take that trade at all and wait for another opportunity.

I understand that calculating your stop loss and maximum loss in your account size in a live trade is difficult. Remember Rule 2? Day trading is not supposed to be easy. Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account.

Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account. It sounds crazy at the beginning, but you will quickly learn how to manage your account and your risk per trade. You will be amazed at how rapidly the human brain can do calculations on what share size to take and where to set the stop loss.

One trader might become discouraged, curse the market, and give up for the day. Another trader might become frustrated,.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally. Their confidence and peace of mind are connected to their trading results. When traders do well, they feel good. When they encounter losses, they become discouraged, doubtful, and frustrated, questioning themselves, their strategy and their career. Instead of dealing directly and constructively with their losses, they react to the emotions triggered by personalizing the events.

Successful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money.

Successful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money. Almost all professional traders hide their unrealized Profit and Loss (P&L) column while in a trade. They have no interest in seeing how much they are up or down. They focus on the perfect execution of a profit target or a stop loss level.

Consistently profitable traders take every negative or positive trade they make as an opportunity to improve themselves.

Every morning, you should scan the market, find the opportunities, and sometimes in a matter of seconds make decisions on whether you should buy or sell or sell short the Stock in Play, and you need to make that call with a high degree of discipline.

One of the key contributors to traders’ self-discipline is their physical and mental health. People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders.

One of the key contributors to traders’ self-discipline is their physical and mental health. People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders. You may be surprised to read this, but your state of alertness, your energy level, and your overall health have a significant impact on your daily trading results. Those who neglect these aspects of their well-being or, even worse, abuse alcohol or drugs, will find it difficult to concentrate and make good decisions.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process. It is difficult to make and sustain the required mental efforts for day trading when you lack proper sleep or feel down from a lack of exercise. Very often, your moods are influenced by your physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much you eat.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process. It is difficult to make and sustain the required mental efforts for day trading when you lack proper sleep or feel down from a lack of exercise. Very often, your moods are influenced by your physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much you eat. Keep a daily record of both your trading results and your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping your body, and thus your mind, in their peak operating condition.

Aspects of personal lives outside of trading can also affect effectiveness as a trader. Changes in personal relationships such as breakup or divorce, family issues like illness, and financial problems can reduce a person’s ability to focus and make appropriate decisions.

It certainly took time, but I found that the more and more I practiced, the more effectively I was able to execute my trading strategies (that I will explain later).

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade.

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade. You need to have a well-thought-out plan and you need to follow that plan.

This is what many traders find difficult. All of these decisions, the very process of ensuring these decisions fit into your risk tolerance and your strategy parameters, are a tough multitasking call.

I understand that stress. There have been times when I've been in the trade, had an $80,000 position, and all I needed to do was to sell. But as I was looking at my keyboard, I found myself frozen like the proverbial deer in the headlights. I couldn’t even figure out which keys to punch. This sort of paralysis is not unusual when you’re overwhelmed. It happens to every single one of us. But remember, confidence in trading doesn’t arise from being right and profitable in all of your trades, it comes from surviving the occasions of being wrong and losing money.

Trading is stressful. Active day trading is perhaps the most stressful of all trading periods. One mistake can ruin your month. One missed proper profit taking can ruin your week. There is a fine line between being a good trader and being a losing trader. If you are under pressure, don’t make any trades. Take a walk to release your stress and do not restart trading until you are once again focused and calm. Often trading professionals will refresh their minds by going for a run after a bad loss, and then come back to restart trading, but in a simulator and not live, until they are back on track emotionally.

You must take the time to prepare, you must work hard, you must plan your trades, you must take the time afterwards to review your trades, and you cannot do it alone. You cannot succeed on your own. There is so much value in sharing ideas and learning from a community of traders and, should you have one, your mentor.

Are you trading profitably? Have you had five wins in a row or have you had five losses in a row? If you are on a losing streak, will you be in touch with your own emotions and maintain your composure, or will you let your judgment be impaired?.

Once you’ve learned it, the skill of identifying a good stock to trade will not go away.

But it's important to remember that if you start to get over-confident and think you’ve outsmarted the market on trading wisdom, or that you don’t need to learn any more, you’ll often get a quick reminder from that market. You’ll lose money and you will see that the market is correcting you.

I will reiterate: being able to make quick decisions and being able to make and then follow your trading rules are critical for success in the market. As you continue through this book, you are going to read much about risk management. Everything that traders do comes back to risk management because ultimately it is the most important concept for a trader to understand.

Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. You cannot be a successful day trader without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.

But never forget the previously explained 2% rule. Do not take a trade if more than 2% of your account will be put in jeopardy. It very simply is not worth the risk.

There’s a very simple truth that you must accept: you should not expect to be right all of the time. It’s impossible to be. Trading is based on probabilities, and it requires a great deal of patience to identify setups with attractive risk/reward potential. I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day. There would be days when you wouldn’t have enough customers or sales even to support your staff or your lease, but these would be more than offset by days when your business prospered.

If you examine the work of most successful traders, they all take many small losses. Their results are littered with numerous small losses of 7c (cents), 5c, 3c, and even 1c per share. Most good day traders have few losses that are more than 30c per share. Most winning trades should work for you right away.

One of the fundamentals you must learn from this book is that every day trading strategy comes with a stop loss level and you must stop out from stocks that trade against your strategy.

Imagine for a moment that you are shorting a stock below an important resistance level and you are waiting for the price to go lower. That is fine. But suddenly the price turns against you and breaks the resistance level and trades higher. Now your original trade plan is obsolete. You have no reason to stay in the trade. You cannot wait in the trade in the hope that the stock may trade lower again. That is wishful thinking. You can wipe out your trading account with ONE crazy move. The stock may or may not trade lower again, but above the resistance level you have no reason to be short in the stock. If the stock was weak and comes back below the level, you may enter the trade again. Commissions are cheap, so accept a small loss and get out. You can always get back into the trade when the setup is ready.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator. You should move to live trading only if you have mastered accepting and respecting your stop loss. If you don’t know where your stop loss is or where it should be, it means than perhaps you should not be in that trade in the first place. It means you have not planned it correctly. It also means you should step back to reading about and reviewing your strategies and return to again trade in the simulator.

Consistently profitable traders just make sound and reasonable trades. They accept that they cannot control the market or results on every single trade, but they stick to their plan and control their capital. Often you can review your profit and loss at the end of the month. Professional traders often review their P&L quarterly, and then make a decision on their performance and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules. The normal uncertainty of the stock market will result in some of your days being negative, but that does not mean that a negative day was a bad trading day.

“You are only as good as the stocks that you trade.”.

You can be the best trader in the world, but if your stocks do not move, nor have enough volume, then you cannot make money consistently.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted. As a day trader, you must be efficient with your time and buying power (which will be explained in Chapter.

Now, we don’t want stocks to just move, but we seek stocks where we can identify that they are about to move in a certain direction. It is possible that a stock that moves $5 intraday may never offer us excellent risk/reward opportunities. Some stocks move too much intraday without foreshadowing their direction.

I certainly experienced this as a new trader. If you learn the strategies explained in Chapter 7, but you cannot make money consistently, it is possible that you are in the wrong stock.

Again, you are only as good as the stocks you trade.

There is more than one way to select Stocks in Play and make money trading them, and there is definitely more than one correct way.

Some day traders like my friend Trader Brian trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) exclusively.

Many have developed proprietary filters to find stocks. Others concentrate on trading the markets as a whole with index Futures.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:5.

Trading the right Stocks in Play help you to combat algorithmic programs.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels which we can trade off from.

You must remember that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume. If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

Interestingly enough, when you take a close look at the chart, you realize that on those days the stock gapped up or down.

The other days were comprised of just normal, high frequency, algorithmic trading. Retail traders should stay away from stocks that are trading normally.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing.

How do you recognize the behavior of the market? Index funds such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500 (SPY) are usually good indicators of what the overall market is doing. If the Dow.

If the Dow Jones or the SPY are red, it means that the overall market is weak. If the Dow Jones or the SPY are strong, then the overall market will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume is independent of the overall market; they are Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are.

In day trading, Alpha stocks are the ones that are independent of both the overall market and their sector.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares. You need certain liquidity in the stock to be able to get in and out of the stock without difficulty.

What makes a stock a Stock in Play? Usually it is the release of fundamental news about the stock either the day before or during the same trading day.

I check the news on all stocks up or down more than 2% pre-market and shortlist my Gappers watchlist (which I will explain further along in this book). Stocks in Play the day before are often still in play for a few days after.

In Chapter 7, I explain specific day trading strategies such as Momentum, Reversal, VWAP, and Moving Average. For the moment, your main question needs to be, how do I find the stock for each strategy? I categorize stocks for retail trading into three classes. Based on my experiences, this categorization provides some clarity on how to find stocks and on how to adopt a strategy for them.

Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

Low float stocks can be volatile and move very fast. Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

These low float stocks are also called “ small cap ” or “ micro-cap ” stocks. Day traders love low float stocks. Now let’s return to those three categories.

Low float stocks under $10 are often highly manipulated and difficult to trade, and therefore only very experienced and highly equipped retail traders should trade these stocks.

The first category consists of low float stocks that are priced under $10.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock. No beginner or even intermediate trader can trade with such accuracy and efficiency.

When it comes to low float stocks, the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy — which I detail in Chapter 7 —works best. The other strategies in this book are not suitable for low float sub-$10 stocks.

Trading low float stocks is very difficult for the new trader. It is difficult to read the direction of their next move and therefore they are very difficult to manage your risk while trading them. I discourage new traders from trading low float stocks. When the new trader is wrong, the loss is such that it wipes out many gains.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares. Many of my strategies explained in this book work well on these stocks, especially the VWAP and Support or Resistance Strategies. Medium float stocks that are more expensive than $100 are not popular among retail day traders and I myself avoid them. You usually cannot buy many shares of them because of their high price. Therefore, it is basically useless to day trade them. Leave them for the institutional traders.

The third category of stocks for trading is m ega cap stocks like Apple, Alibaba, Yahoo, Microsoft and Home Depot. These are well established companies that usually have over $500 million in public shares available for trading. These stocks are traded in millions of shares every day. As you may guess, these stocks move only when large institutional traders, investment banks, and hedge funds are buying or selling large positions. Retail traders like us, who typically trade 100 to 1,000 shares, usually cannot move the price of these stocks. Retail traders should avoid these stocks unless there is a good fundamental catalyst for them.

From the strategies set forth in Chapter 7, Reversals and Moving Average Strategies usually work well on these stocks.

Do not forget though, unless there is a fundamental catalyst, these stocks are being heavily traded by computers and high frequency traders and are not suitable for retail day trading.

Low float (less than 10 million) Under $10 Only Momentum (Long) Medium float (10-500 million) $10-$100 All, mostly VWAP and Support or Resistance Large float (+500 million) Any (usually +$20) All, mostly Moving Average and Reversal.

Stocks in Play can be found in two ways: Pre-market morning watchlist Real time intraday scans.

Experienced traders are sensitive to being in the right stocks at the right time. As I mentioned, traders are just as good as the stocks they trade. I and the traders in my community use a scanner every morning that I program to find Stocks in Play based on the following criteria:.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2%.

Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market.

Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

Stocks that have Average True Range of at least 50 cents (how large of a range a stock has on average every day).

There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

As a rule, I do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out).

I look for highly traded stocks, so that buying and selling 1,000 shares won’t be a problem. That is why I am looking at stocks with an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

When there are some fundamental catalysts, there will be unusual pre-market activity and a Stock in Play will have gapped up or down before the market opens with a significant number of shares being traded (such as 50,000 shares).

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily.

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily. That is a good number.

If you have 1,000 shares, you may profit $1,000 from the trade. But if ATR is only 10 cents, then that trading range is not attractive for me.

As you can see, I have highlighted the Gap (%) and Float columns on my watchlist.

From over 4,000 stocks, I now have only eight candidates. I will go over each of them before the market opens at 9:30 a.m. I will check the news on each of them to learn why they gapped up or down. Is there a fundamental catalyst for that stock? Has there been any news coverage or extreme events for that company?.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups. I plan my trades before the market opens (I provide some thoughts on how to create if-then statements in Chapter 9) and then I wait for the market bell. I then trade my plan.

A high short interest indicates traders or investors think a stock’s price is likely to fall. But the challenge with high short interest is that these stocks are more prone to a short squeeze by bullish investors and traders. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers panic and are scrambling to return their borrowed shares, forcing prices to increase quickly and dangerously. You do not want to be stuck short in a short squeeze.

Figure 4.3 below is a screenshot of a scanner on my Trade Ideas software (see Chapter 5) that is set to find real time stocks for me that:.

Have gapped up or down at least $1.

Have ATR of more than 50 cents.

Have average relative volume of at least 1.5 (the stock is trading at 1.5 times its normal volume).

Have average daily trading volume of at least 500,000 shares.

Having ATR of more than 50 cents is important because you want the stock to move enough during the day so you can make a profit out of its volatility.

There is no point in trading a stock that is moving only 5 cents on average in a day.

I will also take a look at the sector of stocks. If I have a few stocks in one sector, there is a good chance that these stocks are not in play. They have high relative volume because their sector is under heavy trading by institutional traders. It is important to know that stocks usually trade with their sector.

Remember, you are only as good as the stock you trade, so if you are the best trader in the world, but in a wrong stock, you will lose money.

If you join a community of day traders such as mine, you will be able to see my scanner in real time. These scanners are costly, around $100 per month, so at the beginning of your career transition to day trading, you will probably want to keep your expenses down as much as possible.

Sometimes you have to plan a trade in a few minutes and at other times in just a few seconds. This is why you need months of training in simulator accounts to well understand the decision making process.

This strategy involves taking only the best setups and waiting on the sidelines until I see something worth trading.

Day trading can be a boring profession – most of the time you are just sitting and watching your list. In fact, if day trading is not boring for you, then you are probably overtrading.

Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) enforce laws that limit the number of trades a trader can make if they are undercapitalized. The rules adopt the term "pattern day trader", which includes any person that day trades (buys and then sells or sells short and then buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five business days. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that they day trade. The required minimum equity must be in their account prior to any day trading activities. If the account falls below the $25,000 requirement, the pattern day trader will not be permitted to day trade again until their account is restored to the $25,000 minimum equity level.

Although many new traders who do not have more than $25,000 in their account do not appreciate this rule, and see it as a barrier, it actually is in place to protect amateur traders from losing their limited capital to the high fees and commissions of brokers.

Direct-access brokers are the answer to this question. These firms concentrate on speed and order execution - unlike a full-service broker that focuses on research and advice to investors.

As mentioned above, the PDT rule applies, meaning CenterPoint Securities requires at least $25,000 (for U.S. residents only) to open an account.

They are offering members of our community a flat commission rate of $2.95/trade, regardless of share size in your trade. This is an astoundingly low fee, compared to the typical $4.95/trade charge of many other brokers.

When a broker notices that you are using leverage and losing money, they might issue a “ margin call ” to you. A margin call is a serious warning and day traders must avoid getting them. It means that your loss is now equal to the original money you had in your account. You must add more money or else your broker will freeze your account. If you need to know more about margin, leverage or margin calls, check the broker’s website, do some research on the Internet, email me, or ask other traders in your chatroom.

If your broker doesn't use a platform or software that has Hotkeys, you're not going to get in and out of trades fast enough.

Swing traders enter and exit trades within days or weeks, therefore end-of-day data that is available on the Internet for free is sufficient for them.

A bid is always lower, an ask is always higher, and the difference is called the bid-ask spreads.

The most important information you must take away from Level 2 is the bid-ask spreads. Spreads are higher in lower volume traded stocks, as the market makers who dominate such stocks demand higher fees from those who want to join their party.

The bid-ask spreads are likely to be small, perhaps only one cent on a quiet day in an actively traded stock. They grow wider as prices accelerate on the way up or down and may become huge—I have seen up to $2—after a severe drop or a very sharp rally.

Here is what I have on my charts: Price action in the form of candlesticks Volume of shares being traded 9 Exponential Moving Average (9 EMA) 20 Exponential Moving Average (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average (50 SMA) 200 Simple Moving Average (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price.

I don’t trade without knowing nearby significant intraday levels of support or resistance.

I keep the color of all my moving average indicators in grey except VWAP which is colored in blue. VWAP is the most important day trading indicator and needs to be easily and quickly distinguished from other moving averages.

I don’t want to have a lot of colors on my charts so I maintain a white background with mostly red and black coloring. Heavily colored charts are confusing and over the long term irritate your eyes and limit your vision.

If you place a market order, it will be filled at the current price, whatever that happens to be. A limit order, on the other hand, allows you to specify the maximum or minimum price you will accept.

In market orders, essentially, you are getting filled at the bad side of bid-ask spreads. A market order buys at the ask (high side) and sells at the bid (low side).

The problem with using market orders is that the market can quickly change, and so then does the bid-ask spread, and thus you may get your order filled at a very bad price. For example, if the bid-ask spread is $10.95-$10.97, market orders should buy immediately at $10.97 for you, right? When your market orders come to the Exchange, the market can quickly change to $11.10-$11.15, and therefore your buy market order will be filled at $11.15. That is a 15 cents slippage. And that is really bad.

Market makers and many professional traders make a good living from filling market orders. I discourage traders from placing market orders at any time. A market order is like a blank check. Most of the time a market order will be filled very closely to the quoted bid or ask price, but sometimes you will get a nasty surprise.

Use limit orders whenever possible.

Swing traders commonly use limit orders.

“Buy me now, but up to this price! Not higher!” “Sell me now, but down to this price! Not lower!”.

I use marketable limit orders for all of my day trades. I typically buy at the “ask+5 cents” and sell at the “bid-5 cents”. In the next section, I will show you details of my order Hotkeys.

In my opinion, it is almost impossible to day trade profitably without using Hotkeys.

You may have noticed in Figure 5.4 that I have different Hotkeys for when a stock is in Short Selling Restriction (SSR) mode. An SSR is triggered when a stock is down 10% or more from the previous day's close. In that case, regulators and the Exchanges restrict short selling of the stock when its price is dropping. You can only sell short on the ask, you cannot sell short directly to the buyers (on the bid). It means that the priority for selling is for the sellers who currently hold positions, not for the short sellers who are wanting to profit from the downward movement. If you want to sell short, you have to queue up on the ask side and wait for buyers to come to you. Real sellers, on the other hand, can accept bids from buyers and get rid of their positions.

Part of your education includes trading in simulators for a few months, and during these months, you must master your Hotkeys.

Another important reminder is to always use a wired keyboard that is plugged into your computer. Wireless keyboards can send repeat keystrokes, errant keystrokes, or can fail to send orders at all, especially when low in battery power.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using. One time I spilled water on my keyboard while trading. My keyboard stopped working. Fortunately, I did not have any open position at that moment.

One of the common challenges that new traders mention is not knowing what to trade.

Never forget that successful traders are independent thinkers.

The Japanese began using technical analysis and some early versions of candlesticks to trade rice in the 17 th century.

Rule 9: Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.

At every moment in the market there are basically three categories of traders: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided traders. The actual prices of transactions are the result of the actions of all of these traders at a particular point in time: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided.

In day trading, the difference between the two is called the bid-ask spread (Chapter 5).

Buyers are buying because they expect that prices will go up. Buying by bulls pushes the market up, or as I like to phrase it, “Buyers are in control.” The result is that buyers are willing to pay higher and higher prices and to bid on top of each other. They are apprehensive that they will end up paying higher prices if they don’t buy now. Undecided traders accelerate price increases by creating a feeling of urgency among the buyers, who then buy quickly and cause prices to go higher.

The goal of a successful day trader is to figure out if the sellers will end up in control or if the buyers will end up in control, and then make a calculated move, at the appropriate time, quickly and stealthily.

Your job is to analyze the balance of the power between buyers and sellers and bet on the winning group. Fortunately, candlestick charts reflect this fight and mass psychology in action. A successful day trader is a social psychologist behind a computer and charting software. Day trading is the study of mass psychology.

Candles are always born neutral. After birth, they can grow to become either bearish, bullish or, on rare occasions, neither. When a candle is born, traders do not know what it will become. They may speculate but they do not truly know what a candle is until it dies (closes). After a candle is born, the battle begins. The bulls and the bears fight it out, and the candle displays who is winning. If buyers are in control, you will see the candle move up and form a bullish candle. If sellers are in control of the price, you will see the candle move down and become a bearish candle. You may be thinking that this is all very obvious, but many traders don’t see candles as a fight between buyers and sellers. That little candle is an excellent indicator that tells you who is currently winning the battle, the bulls (buyers) or the bears (sellers).

Just by learning to read candlesticks, you will begin to generate an opinion on the general attitude for a stock. Again, this is called the “ price action.

Understanding who is in control of the price is an extremely important skill in day trading.

Day trading truly is the study of mass psychology during the day.

Back in Chapter 2 I used the example of a sandbox in a schoolyard. You don’t want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. If you are, you’re in the wrong place. If the buyers are strong, you want to be buying and holding. If the sellers are strong, you want to be selling and selling short. You definitely do not want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. You want to be where the action is. And if you can’t decide what that action is, if it looks like it’s a toss-up, don’t do anything.

Similarly, if a Doji forms in a bearish downward trend, it suggests that the bears have become exhausted and the bulls (buyers) are fighting back to take control of the price.

Always remember that these candles only indicate indecision and not a definite reversal.

As a day trader, you shouldn’t care about companies and their earnings. Day traders are not concerned about what companies do or what they make. Your attention should only be on price action, technical indicators and chart patterns. I know more stock symbols than the names of actual companies.

I don't mingle fundamental analysis with technical analysis while making a trade; I focus exclusively on the technical indicators.

I’ve come to recognize in my trading career that the best setups are the nine strategies that I will be explaining in this chapter.

These are simple strategies in theory, but they are difficult to master and require plenty of practice.

Another point to remember is that in the market right now, over 60% of the volume is algorithmic high frequency trading. That means you are trading against computers.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute charts.

And please, remember, my philosophy of trading is that you must master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method will work to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is what separates the winners from the losers.

Two traders enter into a trade based on one strategy. The positions go their way and then pull back a bit. The first trader fears losing his gain and takes a quick, small profit. The second trader adds to the position on the pull back and books a large gain. Same idea, different outcomes, all as the result of two different mindsets and trade management styles.

Day trading is a business. Like any other business, success is not just about products and services but much of it will be the result of an excellent management of the business. For example, if you don’t hire the right people for your business, or supervise them properly, or track your inventory, you’ll fail to make money with even the best products and services.

Rather, trade management is referring to what you do with the position after you’ve entered it and before you’ve exited it.

Novice traders believe that when they enter the trade, they should not do anything else but patiently wait for the price to hit their profit target or stop loss level. This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea.

This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea. As the market moves after your entry, you will receive new price action and data about your initial trade idea: the price action of the stock is either supporting or not supporting your reasons for being in that trade. Therefore, you need to manage your open position.

For example, if you are expecting a break from a strong support level to the downside, and you want to profit the move to the downside with a short position, you may want to start with shorting 100 shares. Momentum scalper traders will usually start scalping when the level breaks to the downside. When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level.

Momentum scalper traders will usually start scalping when the level breaks to the downside. When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level. If it is held below the support level (now acting as a resistance level), you can start adding to your short position on the way down. If it does not act as a resistance level and the price moves back up, you will get stopped out for a small loss because you only had 100 shares.

I’ll discuss scalping and scalpers further in the section that follows on the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick. Often my friend Brian Pez and I will trade against each other, but we will both be profitable when we finish our day. And how does that happen? It’s based on practice, discipline and controlling our emotions in the heat of the trade, even though I do like to think that I’m a better trader than him!.

In other trades, you just want to go for a “taste” and perhaps add more later. Learning when to have the most size is a skill that new traders must acquire.

No matter how good of an opportunity, you may not risk more than 2% of your account in one trade. Live to trade another day.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size. Likewise, you can lose a great deal of money trading in and out of an active stock with too big of a size.

For example, for low float stocks that can move 10% or 20% in a matter of seconds, I never take a large position, even though their price is typically low (in the range of $1-$10) and I have sufficient buying power for a very large position.

My trade size depends on the price of the stock and on my account size and risk management rule (Chapter 3), but 800 shares is my usual size if I am trading in the $10-$50 price range.

If the trade goes in my favor, I add another 400 shares (note that I add into my winning position, not into a losing one).

I sell 400 shares in the first target, bringing my stop loss to break-even (my entry point).

I always retain some shares in case the prices keep moving in my favor.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100. The more expensive stocks are less attractive to retail traders and are often dominated by computers and institutional traders.

Their initial share size might be relatively small, but traders will add to their position as the price action validates their idea.

For example, for a 1,000-share trade, they enter either 500/500 or 100/200/700 shares. If done correctly, this is an excellent method of risk and trade management.

I rarely scale down into a losing trade. I always scale up ; I add to my winning position.

Averaging down losing positions is perhaps the most common mistake a beginner will make and that will almost certainly lead to the end of their short trading career.

Remember, averaging down does not work for day traders. I have tried it. 85% of the time you will profit when you average down. But the 15% of the time you are wrong, you will blow up your account.

Remember, it only takes ONE bad trade to blow up your account and for you to be done with your day trading career forever.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished. I thought the sell off must be a normal pull back. During that time, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3x Shares (ticker: LABU) started to sell off too, and its share price dropped from $148 to below $60. I purchased 100 shares at $120 with the hope that it would go back to $148. It did not. It went below $100. I added an additional 100 shares. My average was now $110. It plunged further to $80. I added 200 more. My average became $90. It went further to $60. I added 400 shares more (and I was almost out of money). My average became $70 and I held a huge 800 share position on LABU. It dropped further to $58. I was just long, and I was so very wrong. I got a margin call from my broker. I could not add further money because I did not have any. My broker froze my account and sold my position. I had the most devastating loss in my trading career. Two days later LABU rebounded to over $100.

I said to myself, if I only had a bigger account….

I don’t know why, but traders such as Brian Hunter will at times stubbornly put being right about their decision over making money. These are the types of traders who conveniently forget that the market can remain irrational longer than they can survive in the game. You cannot let your pride get the best of you. If you’ve made a bad decision, take a loss and get out early. Predictions and speculations have their place, but the price action of the stock is the most important indicator for traders like us. If you believe in an irrefutable trading opinion and the price action does not confirm your bias, then simply do not make the trade.

You want to enter the trade, but you should not chase the trade, because at point B it is very extended and already at a high price. In addition, you cannot say where your stop loss should be. You must never enter a trade without knowing where your stop is.

When they announced that they had a new $50 million contract to build a new ship (There’s a fundamental catalyst! Remember Chapter 2?).

Knew that when the price went higher, closer.

I knew that when the price went higher, closer to B, buyers would jump on massively.

Close to point D, the volume suddenly spiked, which meant that many more traders were jumping into the trade.

My profit target was when the stock made a new low on a 5-minute chart, which was a sign of weakness.

When I observe with my scanner or I’m advised by someone in our chatroom that a stock is surging up from point A and reaching a significant new high for the day (point B), I wait to see if the price makes a support higher than point A. I call this point C. I do not jump into the trade right away.

I watch the stock during its consolidation period (I’ll explain this term in the next strategy). I choose my share size and stop and exit strategy.

When I see that the price is holding support at level C, I enter the trade close to the price of point C in anticipation of moving forward to point D or higher.

My stop is the loss of point C. If the price goes lower than point C, I sell and accept the loss. Therefore, it is important to buy the stock close to point C to minimize the loss. Some traders wait and buy only at point D to ensure that the ABCD Pattern is really working. In my opinion, that approach basically reduces your reward while at the same time increasing your risk.

If the price moves higher, I sell half of my position at point D, and bring my stop higher to my entry point (break-even).

I sell the remaining position as soon as my target hits or I sense that the price is losing steam or that the sellers are acquiring control of the price action. When the price makes a new low on my 5-minute chart, it is a good indicator that the buyers are almost exhausted.

Consolidation means that the traders who bought stocks at a lower price are now selling and taking their profits. Although that is happening, the price does not decrease sharply because the buyers are still entering into trades and the sellers are not yet in control of the price. Many traders who missed buying the stock before the Bull Flag started, will now be looking for an opportunity to take a trade.

Wise traders know that it is risky to buy a stock when the price is increasing significantly. That’s called “ chasing the stock ”. Professional traders aim to enter the trade during quiet times and take their profits during the volatile times.

They jump in or out when stocks begin to run, but grow bored and lose interest when the prices are, shall I say, sleepy.

Chasing the stocks is an account killer for beginners. You must wait until the stock finds its high point, and then you must wait for the consolidation. As soon as the price start breaking up in the consolidation area, you can begin purchasing stocks. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, patience truly is a virtue.

Third and higher consolidation periods are risky because the price has probably been very extended in a way that indicates that the buyers will soon be losing their control.

I don’t trade more than two Bull Flags in a stock and, as you can see in this chart, the stock started to sell off after the third Bull Flag (at around $7). Aside from the strategy, did you notice that OPTT moved from $1.50 to almost $7 in just 35 minutes? This kind of move can be expected from low float under $10 stocks.

Get in, scalp, and get out quickly. That’s the philosophy of momentum scalpers:.

The Bull Flag is a long-based strategy. You should not short a Bull Flag.

I personally don’t trade much momentum. It is a risky strategy and beginners should be very careful trading these. If you choose to, trade only in a small size and only after sufficient practice in simulators. You will also need a super-fast execution system for scalping.

If you are part of our chatroom, you will hear me say time and time again that what goes up, must come down. Don’t chase the trade if it is too extended . The inverse is also true. What goes down will definitely come back up to some extent.

An RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest. The RSI, developed initially by famous technical analyst Welles Wilder, Jr., is an indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses in price over a period of time to measure the speed and change of price movement. The RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traders in Reversal Strategies use RSI values to identify overbought or oversold conditions and to find buy or sell signals. For example, RSI readings above 90 indicate overbought conditions and RSI readings below 10 indicate oversold conditions. If you.

You must simultaneously look for a certain RSI level and a certain number of consecutive candles.

What you definitely don’t want is to be on the wrong side of a reversal trade, or, as we call it, “ catching a falling knife ”. It doesn’t sound like a good idea in real life and it's not a good idea in trading. It means that when a stock is selling off badly (the falling knife), you don’t want to buy on the assumption that it should bounce. If the stocks are dropping, you want to wait for the confirmation of the reversal.

This will usually be (1) the formation of a Doji or indecision candle and (2) the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high near an important intraday support level. That is my entry point. I set my stop at the low of the previous candlestick or at the loss of the support level.

Institutional traders and hedge funds have started selling their large position to the public market and the stock price is tanking.

Traders have started short selling a stock because of some bad fundamental news, but they will have to cover their shorts sooner or later. That is where you wait for an entry. When short sellers are trying to cover their shorts, the stock will reverse quickly, that is called a “short squeeze”. You want to ride that.

But please, remember the mantra: what goes up, must come down.

Each Reversal Strategy has four important elements: At least five candlesticks on a 5-minute chart moving upward or downward.

The stock is being traded at or near an important intraday support or resistance level.

I only take reversal trades when the price is near a significant support level (for Bottom Reversal) or a significant resistance level (for Top Reversal).

When the trend is coming to an end, usually indecision candles, such as a spinning top or Doji, form. That is when you need to be ready.

A Doji is a candle that has a wick longer than its body.

This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

The same is true about a bullish Doji. You can also see a picture of a bullish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long lower wick that some would call a bottom tail and others would call a hammer. When you have a hammer candle with a bottom tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved down, was unable to hold at those low levels, and was bought up. This indicates a battle between the buyers and the sellers in which the sellers lost their push down. It is a good indication that the buyers may now gain control of the price and push that price up.

You can see a picture of a bearish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long upper wick that some would call a top tail and that others would call a shooting star. This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

In reversal trading, it is best that the RSI be at the extremes (above 90, below 10). Once you find that, you must then look for an actual entry near a strong intraday support (for Bottom Reversal) or resistance level (for Top Reversal).

As mentioned, an entry for me is going to be either the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high (for Bottom Reversal) or to make a new low (for Top Reversal) and only when the price is being traded near an important intraday support or resistance level.

In a Bottom Reversal, when you’ve had a long run of consecutive candles making new lows, the first candle that makes the new high near an important support level is very significant.

The 5-minute chart is cleaner. The first 5-minute candle to make a new high near an intraday support level is the point at which I enter the reversal, with a stop at the low of the day.

Once you’re in one of these trades, your exit indicators are quite simple. I take profit when the price reaches a moving average (either 9 EMA, 20 EMA or VWAP) or reaches another important intraday level.

In a Bottom Reversal, if the stock pops up and then suddenly moves back down, I stop out for a loss. If I jump in long, buying stock and hoping the price will go higher, and instead the price ends up just going sideways, it’s a sign that I am probably going to see a consolidation for another move down, and that is an indication that the price is probably going to continue to drop. If I get in and I hold for a few minutes and the price stays flat, I get out, no matter what happens after that. I may be wrong, but I don’t like to expose my account to the unknown.

I need to be in the right setup, and if it is not ready yet, I’m out. If I get into the profit zone, I can start adjusting my stop, first to break-even, and then to the low of the last 5-minute candle. I will then keep adjusting my stop as I move up.

An indecision candlestick at the bottom of the downtrend signifies a potential reversal, and, as you can see, right after that is a big swing back up.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves. You will probably miss the moment when the stock starts to sell off, and you won’t have time to sell short the stock for profit, but you can always prepare for the reversal trade.

My scanner, at 10:57 a.m., showed me that ALR had seven consecutive candles to the downside, a relatively low float (80 million shares) and a relative volume of 1.21, which meant it was trading higher than usual.

At times, a reversal happens so fast that indecision candlesticks will not form. Therefore, it is important to observe the price action near significant intraday levels, and to of course confirm the reversal with an indication of higher than usual trading volume.

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal. That stock may be a good candidate for a Moving Average Trend trade (explained in the pages to come). You want to find stocks that are really stretched out to the downside or, for short selling, really stretched out to the upside, in a short period of time, and with high volume at the reversal point. You want to see that large extension, which means that you should look for considerable volume at the reversal point (such as the ALR Bottom Reversal in the above example from my scanner that is marked as Figure 7.13).

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal.

Once you find that, you then must look for a couple of key indicators that will suggest that the price may be about to turn, and that is when you then take the position. I’ve said it many times: what goes up, must come down.

Oftentimes these stocks will give up days’ and weeks’ or years’ worth of price gain in just a matter of minutes. It is very critical to be able to correctly time the reversal.

I’ll say it again: the key to your success with Top and Bottom Reversals is trading the extremes at or near a significant daily support or resistance level. How do I quantify these extremes? These are a few of the things that I look for:.

An extreme RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest.

A very high volume of shares being traded. Volume is usually increasing with the direction of price action and is at its maximum at the point of reversal.

Finally, more than five consecutive candles ending with an indecision candle or a Doji is definitely going to catch my attention. These candles usually demonstrate that sellers are losing their control while buyers are becoming more powerful, and that indicates the end of a trend.

Sometimes reversals happen without an indecision candlestick. In those cases, you should look for strong reversal candlesticks – a bullish body for Bottom Reversals and a bearish body for Top Reversals.

I will add a caveat to this final point: there will be times when you will have between five and ten consecutive candles without much price action. They may be drifting down slowly, but not quickly enough for you to sense that it is a good reversal. You must look for a combination of these indicators all occurring at the same time. Never try to go short just because the prices are too high. You should never argue with the crowd’s decision or the market, even if it doesn’t make sense to you. You do not have to run with the crowd - but you should not run against.

Many new traders end up trading with a very poor profit-to-loss ratio because they sell their winners too soon and they hold their losers too long. This is an extremely common habit among new traders. The Reversal Strategy, however, lends itself to having a larger profit-to-loss ratio for new traders.

Set up a scanner to flag stocks with four or more consecutive candlesticks going downward in an extreme manner. When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

I wait for confirmation of a Bottom Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bullish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bullish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant intraday support level, and (3) the RSI must be lower than 10.

When I see the stock make a new 1-minute or 5-minute high, I buy the stock.

My stop loss is the low of the previous red candlestick or the low of the day.

My profit target is either (1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price, described later in this chapter) or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) the stock makes a new 5-minute low, which means that the buyers are exhausted and the sellers are once again gaining control.

(remember, we retail traders look for unusual trading volumes).

Wait for confirmation of a Top Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bearish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bearish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant resistance level at high volume, and (3) the RSI must be higher than 90.

When I see the stock make a new 5-minute low, I consider this as a sign of weakness. I start short selling the stock if I have shares available to short.

(1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) when the stock makes a new 5-minute high, which means the buyers are once again gaining control and the sellers are exhausted.

Some day traders focus exclusively on reversal trades and in fact base their entire careers on them. Reversal trades are certainly the most classic of the various strategies with a very good risk/reward ratio and, interestingly, virtually every trading day you will find stocks that are good candidates for reversal trades. I myself am trading more and more reversal trades these days, especially during late morning and afternoon trading. However, reversal trading is not yet the cornerstone of my trading strategies. I am more of a VWAP and Support or Resistance trader, which I will explain later on in this book.

These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

In three areas marked on the chart, the price broke the 9 EMA and went slightly higher, but a 5-minute candlestick did not actually close above 9 EMA. These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

I quickly look at the previous days’ trading data (on a 1-minute or 5-minute chart) to see if the stock is responding to these moving averages.

If the stock is moving really high away from the moving average, offering me an equally really nice unrealized profit, I may take some profit, usually at half-position.

Traders say: you can never go broke by taking good profits. If the price pulls back to the moving average, I may add again to my position and continue the trend trade.

Personally don’t trade very often based on moving averages. I look at them to see potential levels of support or resistance, but I rarely make any trade based upon a trend because, in a trend trade strategy, you are usually left exposed in the market for a considerable length of time. Some trend trades can last as long as several hours and that is too long for my personality. I would like to take my profit in a matter of minutes. I rarely will wait even an hour. Another reason that I do not often trade these strategies is that they usually best work during Mid-day and the Close. At the Open (in the morning session), when volatility is high, it’s hard to identify a Moving Average Trend play. These slow trends are best identified during Mid-day, when there is low volatility, and they usually end near the Close (around 3 p.m. New York time) when the professional traders on Wall Street start to dominate the trading.

The combination of all of these factors have led me to be a VWAP trader who sometimes trades with the Opening Range Breakout Strategy.

However, I want to emphasize that trading strategies are not something that you can imitate just from reading a book, speaking with a mentor, or attending a class. You have to slowly and methodically develop your preferred method and then stick with it. There is nothing wrong with any strategy if it works for you. There is no good and bad in any of these strategies; it truly is a matter of personal choice.

VWAP is an indicator of who is in control of the price action - the buyers or the sellers. When stock is traded above the VWAP, it means that the buyers are in overall control of the price and there is a buying demand on the stock. When a stock price breaks below the VWAP, it is safe to assume that the sellers are gaining control over the price action.

VWAP is often used to measure the trading efficiency of institutional traders. Professional traders working for investment banks or hedge funds who need to trade large amount of shares each day cannot enter or exit the market by just one single order. The market is not liquid enough to enter a one-million share buy order. Therefore, they need to liquidate their orders slowly during the day. After buying or selling a large position in a stock during the day, institutional traders compare their price to VWAP values.

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market).

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market). Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points.

Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points. Institutional traders with large orders try to buy or sell large positions around VWAP.

Traders who buy significantly higher than VWAP may be penalized because they cost the institution money for taking that large position. Institutional traders therefore try to buy below or as close to VWAP as possible. Conversely, when a professional trader has to get rid of a large position, they try to sell at the VWAP or higher. Day traders who know this may benefit from this market activity.

Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

After the market opens, the Stock in Play will trade heavily in the first five minutes. If the Stock in Play has gapped up, some individual shareholders, hedge funds or investment banks may want to as soon as possible sell their shares for a profit, before the price drops. At the same time, some investors wanting to take positions in the stock want to buy as soon as possible before the price goes even higher. Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

After volatility decreases around ten to fifteen minutes into the Open, the stock will move toward or away from the VWAP. This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

Conversely, if there are large shareholders wanting to get rid of their shares, then this is a good point for them to liquidate their positions. They start selling their shares at the VWAP. The price will reject the VWAP and start to move down. This is an excellent short selling opportunity for day traders. If there is no interest in the stock from market makers or institutions, the price may trade sideways near VWAP. Wise traders will then stay away from that stock.

When a stock tries to break the VWAP but cannot, you can short the stock because you can safely assume that the other traders that are watching will also begin to short. A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts. Let's.

A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts.

I sold another position at $22 because I know half-dollars (such as $1.50, $2.50, $3.50) and whole dollars ($1, $2, $3) usually act at a support or resistance level.

When I make my watchlist for the day, I monitor the price action around VWAP at the Open. If a stock shows respect toward VWAP, then I wait until a confirmation of the VWAP break (for short selling) or VWAP support (for going long).

I usually buy as close as possible to VWAP to minimize my risk. My stop will be a break and a close 5-minute close below VWAP. For short selling, I short near VWAP with a stop loss of a close above the VWAP. I keep the trade until I hit my profit target or until I reach a new support or resistance level. I usually sell half-positions near the profit target or support or resistance level and move my stop up to my entry point or break-even.

Many traders love to draw diagonal trend lines. I’m not one of them.

Horizontal support or resistance trading is my favorite style of trading. Because market only remembers price levels, which is why horizontal support or resistance lines on previous price levels make sense, but diagonal trend lines aren’t. In fact, in my opinion, trend lines are among the most deceptive of all tools in trading. I therefore avoid trend lines.

Traders buy at support and sell at resistance, making their effectiveness a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Chapter 4: a stock that has fundamental catalysts such as news, an extreme earnings report or a new drug approval.

Finding price support or resistance levels is tricky and requires trading experience. If you watch me trading every morning, you will see how I place my support or resistance lines on my Stocks in Play.

In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or Moving Averages or other chart patterns that I earlier discussed.

You will usually see indecision candles in the area of support or resistance because that is where buyers and sellers are closely fighting each other.

For day trading, it is better to draw support or resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support or resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on. Previous extreme high and low wicks have been made by day traders, so you should look at those.

All of these levels are extreme price levels for the previous days and, as I explained, I give more attention to wicks and extreme prices than I do to the open or close prices.

Do you see that they are significantly higher near those levels? A high volume confirms that these levels are significant and day traders should pay attention to them.

If the current price of a stock is higher than the previous day close (for Stocks in Play that gapped up), the market is moving from a Green day to a Red day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be negative, which will be shown as red in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Green-to-Red move.

The previous day close is a powerful level of support or resistance and traders should trade toward it when there is rising volume.

If the price is lower than the previous day close (for stocks that gapped down), the market is moving from a Red day to a Green day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be positive, which will be shown as green in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Red-to-Green move.

After a weak Open, the price held below VWAP. I went short, but there was no nearby support or resistance level except the previous day close at $46.52 (the dashed line on my chart). Therefore, I decided to go short from VWAP at around $47.80 for the profit target of the previous day close at $46.52, a nice $1.20 per share profit.

If a stock moves toward the previous day close with high volume, I consider going long with the profit target of the previous day close.

My stop loss is the nearest technical level. If I buy near VWAP, my stop loss will be the break of VWAP. If I buy near a moving average or an important support level, my stop loss will be the break of moving average or support level.

I usually sell all at the profit target. If the price moves in my favor, I bring my stop loss to the break-even and do not let the price turn against me. Red-to-Green moves should work immediately.

Typically, you want to give the opening range at least five minutes. This is called the 5-minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB). Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers.

Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers. They then develop a trade plan in the direction of the 30-minute or 60-minute breakout. In the past, I only traded the trade at the 5-minute ORB, but recently I am more in favor of the 15-minute ORB or the 30-minute ORB. The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range.

The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range. As with most setups, the ORB Strategy tends to work best with mid to large cap stocks, which do not show wild price swings intraday.

Ideally, the stock should trade within a range which is smaller than the Average True Range of the stock (ATR).

For me, stop loss is always a close above VWAP for short positions, and a break below VWAP for long positions.

As I have mentioned, you need the opening range to be smaller than the daily ATR. If a stock moves near or higher than its ATR at the Open, it is not a good candidate for the ORB Strategy. It means that the stock is too volatile and without a catchable move. It is worth mentioning again, Stocks in Play move, and those moves are directional and catchable. If a stock constantly moves up and down $2 with high volume, but without any directional signal, you want to stay away from it. Those stocks are usually being heavily traded by computers.

For example, if its price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness, and you should consider selling if you are long. If you are short and if the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and you may want to cover your short position.

I prefer stocks that have high volume, but also with numerous different orders being traded.

Volume alone does not show the liquidity; the number of orders being sent to the Exchange is as important.

If there was no obvious technical level for the exit and profit target, I exit when a stock shows signs of weakness (if I am long) or strength (if I am short).

For example, if the price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness and I consider selling my position if I am long. If I am short and the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and I consider covering my short position.

You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

I might not be comfortable with a $500 loss, but someone who has a large account can easily hold onto the loss and eventually make profit out of a losing trade. You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

Day trading is not mechanical and automated; it is discretionary: traders need to make real time decisions. The success of each strategy is based on judgment and the proper execution of it by the trader.

I don’t think that having more indicators on your chart helps you in day trading, especially since you need to be able to process information very quickly, at times in just a matter of seconds. I have found that often indicators’ signals will also contradict each other and that will lead to confusion.

For my swing trading, I use more complicated indicators such as MACD because I do not have to make quick decisions. I usually review my swing trading after the market closes, with proper due diligence and evaluation. You can easily find more information about the indicators I’ve mentioned in this section, along with many others, by doing a simple online search.

When you set up a system for trading that has no input or requires no decisions by the trader, then you are entering the world of algorithmic trading, and you will lose trades to investment banks that have million-dollar algorithms and billions of dollars in cash for trading.

I don't expect everything I do to work exactly the same for you. I am happy to help you develop a strategy that is going to work for you, your personality, your account size and your risk tolerance.

The key for now is that you master one strategy. Once you can tread water in the market with your one strategy, you can be a trader without blowing up your account. This is simply a matter of spending time in the chair. The more time you spend watching your charts, the more you will learn.

It is absolutely critical for every trader to be trading a strategy. Plan a trade, and trade the plan. I wish someone had said to me when I first started training, “Andrew, you need to trade a strategy. If you're trading with real money, you must be trading a written strategy, and it must have historical data to verify that it’s worth trading with real money.” You cannot change your plan once you have already entered the trade and have an open position.

The truth about traders is that they fail. They lose money, and a large percentage of those traders are not gaining the education that you are receiving from reading this book.

You may practice three months in a simulator, and then trade small size with real money for one month, and then go back to the simulator to work on your mistakes or practice new strategies for another three months. There is no shame in going back to a simulator at any stage of your day trading career.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day. Accordingly, should I decide to trade during the Mid-day, I lower my share size and keep my stops tight.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day. At times, good trading, and smart trading, is to not be trading at all.

Watch the stocks, prepare for the Close, and be very, very careful with any trading you do.

Reversal, VWAP, Moving Average, and Support or Resistance trades tend to be the best strategies for the Mid-day. I never trade Bull Flag Momentum in Mid-day or at the Close.

If the stock is moving higher in the last hour, it means the professionals are probably bullish on that stock. If the stock is moving lower in the last hour, the market professionals are probably bearish. It is thus a good idea to trade with the professionals and not against them.

VWAP, Support or Resistance, and Moving Average trades tend to be the best strategies for the Close.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them. I created a rule for myself. I am not allowed to lose more than 30% of what I have made in the Open during Mid-day and the Close. If I lose more than the allowed 30%, then I either stop trading or start trading in a simulator.

(which meant the stock on average moves in a range as large as $1.86 during the day).

I looked at the chart and decided to wait and see the price action for the first ten minutes of trading.

My philosophy in trading is that you need to master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method consisting of a few minimal setups will help to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is truly what separates the winners from the losers.

Now that you have learned the basics of a few trading strategies, let’s review the actual process of planning and making a trade.

You now understand the setup you want to trade, but as a beginner trader, you will have a hard time planning and initiating a trade beforehand.

I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, so I firmly believe in the process approach to trading.

My trading process looks like this: Morning routine Develop my watchlist Organize a trade plan Initiate the trade according to plan Execute the trade according to plan Journaling and reflection.

Everyone can read this book or dozens of other books, but only a few people have the discipline to execute correctly. You might have a good setup but select a wrong stock to trade, such as a stock that is being manipulated by computers and institutional traders. Perhaps you will find a proper stock to trade, but you will enter the trade at the wrong time. A bad entry will make a mess of your plan and you will eventually lose your money. You can find a good stock to trade and enter a trade correctly, but if you don’t exit properly, you will turn a winning trade into a losing one. All of the steps of the process are important.

Think about something significant that you do frequently in your life, and then think of how it can best be done. Now, consider how you do it currently. This is a great thought process for traders to have.

Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.

There are scientific studies showing that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on the decision making process.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping body, and thus mind, in their peak operating condition. I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, and I have stopped eating animal-based food, and my performance levels have increased significantly.

Wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I.

I wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I think this is a chicken and egg problem with no real answer, but I believe it is the latter.

If you have always wanted to be in better physical shape, try adding exercises such as running into your routine, and also take control of your salt and sugar intake. If you drink too much alcohol or coffee, try to see if for one month you can stay away from them. These are excellent tests to see if you are emotionally and intellectually strong enough or not to discipline yourself in the face of a losing trade.

Change is hard, but if you wish to be a successful trader, you need to work on changing and developing your personality at every level.

Often traders who fail to make money in trading get frustrated and go out and study more about the market to learn new strategies and additional technical indicators. They don’t realize that their lack of self-discipline, impulsive behavior and their bad life habits are the main cause of their failure, not their technical knowledge.

You have to find one strategy that suits your personality and practice it in your simulator, and then practice it some more. And then you have to stick to it. Like glue.

You also have to have settled in your mind, again, in advance, how much you can afford to risk on any one trade.

Day trading requires a certain mindset, as well as a discipline and a set of skills that not everyone possesses. Interestingly, most of the traders I know are also poker players.

Move to a real account only after at least three months of training with a simulated account and then, start small, with real money. Trade small while you’re learning or when you are feeling stressed. If you wish, you can always have a chat with me in our chatroom and receive some advice and guidance.

Remember, baby steps.

Master one topic, and then and only then move on to the next.

Most traders struggle when they first begin, and many do not have sufficient time in the morning to practice in real time. Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months.

Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months. After four months of paper trading, you need at least another three months of trading in small share size to master your emotions and practice self-discipline while trading with your real money.

After six months, you may become a seasoned trader. Eight months is probably better than six months, and twelve months is perhaps better than both.

Many traders think of inspiring goals such as making a million dollars or being able to trade for a living from a beach house in the Caribbean.

A good trading day is a day when you are disciplined and you trade sound strategies.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult. The best swing traders can expect an annual return of 20% on their account size. Day traders, on the other hand, look to profit between 0.5-1% of their account size daily.

Learn as much as you can, but keep a degree of healthy skepticism about everything, including this book.

Amateurs, on the other hand, are focused on making money every single day.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money,.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money, especially when smaller share sizes are involved.

Your goal is to develop trading skills and not to make money. You must focus on getting better every single day, one trade after another. That is How to Day Trade for a Living . Push your comfort zone to find greater success.

“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”.

Review daily charts and identify important levels of support or resistance. I do not make a trade unless I know the average volume, Average True Range, important technical levels, short interest, and fresh news for the Stocks in Play.

Each day, traders shouldn’t choose more than two or three of these stocks to focus on.

Most professional traders do not arrive later than 7:30 a.m. New York time. Certainly experienced traders with a strong community and powerful scanners can stroll in later, but 9 a.m. is the latest that most serious traders arrive.

Every trade is a new puzzle that you must solve.

Before making a trade, you must create a plan for your trades or a series of “ if-then ” statements. Develop some plans as to when you might take a position in one of your stocks on your watchlist. If you see the x scenario, then you will buy at this price. Continue creating “if-then” scenarios for each outcome.

If the price cannot push higher than VWAP in the first fifteen minutes of the market Open, then I will go short until the previous day close of $48.10.

If the price does sell off to the previous day close of $48.10, then I will go long and ride the reversal to the VWAP.

If the price pushes over VWAP with high volume, then I will go long and ride the momentum to sell at the next resistance level of $53.25.

If the price breaks over the daily level of $53.25, then I will go long again until the daily level of $55.50 (which is not shown on the above Figure 9.2).

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers?.

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers? What technical levels are most important? Is this stock stronger or weaker than the market? Where is most of the volume being traded? At the VWAP? Or the first five minutes? Or near moving averages? How much volume at a price causes the stock to move up or down? What is the bid-ask spread? Is it tradeable? How quickly does the stock move? Is it being traded smoothly or is it choppy, jumping up and down with every trade? Is the stock trading in a particular pattern on a 5-minute chart? How is the stock being traded on a 1-minute chart? These are some of the questions that I ask myself and then answer before trading a stock. All of this information should be gathered before you make any trade. This is what we mean by hard work. As you can see, day trading is an intense intellectual pursuit which requires hard work. Remember Rule 2?.

Turning off the PC early after a few bad trades is a strategy that should be reserved for the rare occasions when it is absolutely essential to give your brain a break. Usually, spending some time in a simulator after some losses will clear your mind sufficiently. Novice traders using a simulator should keep on trading and practicing until the Close. After all, trading in the simulator is not nearly as stressful as real trading with real money. Using a simulator with no commission and no P&L is still no excuse for overtrading. At all times the focus must be on sound strategies with excellent risk/reward opportunities.

Discipline is executing your detailed plan every single time. If your plan is to buy a stock at VWAP and your stop loss is if it fails to hold VWAP, then you must accept the loss immediately and get out of the trade if the stock fails to hold the VWAP.

The market does not reward stubbornness.

Do not judge your trading strategy based upon one trade. Executing your plan, and being disciplined, will lead to long-term success. Many times your plan will be fine and solid but a hedge fund manager out of nowhere will decide to liquidate a position in a stock that you are trading, the price will drop suddenly and you will get stopped out.

A professional trader accepts the loss and gets out of the trade. You then re-evaluate and plan another if-then scenario. You can always get back into the stock. Commissions are cheap (for most of the brokers), and professionals often take several quick stabs at a trade before it will start running in their favor.

Trading teaches you a great deal about yourself, about your mental weaknesses and about your strengths. This alone ensures that trading is a valuable life experience.

“ There is no question in my mind that, if I were to start trading full-time, knowing what I know now, I would either join a proprietary trading firm or would form my own “virtual trading group” by connecting online (and in real time) with a handful of like-minded traders.

Make sure to include the following points in your trading journal: Your physical well-being (lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much food the night before, etc.) The time of the day you made the trade The strategy you were anticipating How you found the opportunity (from a scanner, a chatroom, etc.) Quality of your entry (risk/reward) Sizing/management of your trade (scaling in and out as planned) Execution of exits (following profit targets or stop losses) I personally take a screenshot from my screen (with a free software called Screenshot Captor ) and journal my trades in my blog with that software. Please visit my blog to get some ideas on how to journal your trades. You do not have to follow my style, but you should find what works best for you because to be successful, you must journal your trades daily.

One Good Trade that the professional traders at his firm video-record all of their trades during the day.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively. The next month, you should focus on Moving Average Trend trades.

When you first begin, you must focus on the process of trading, not on how to make money for a living. You must allow at least eight to twelve months before you will become consistently profitable.

If we stubbornly insist on trying to prove to the market that we are right, we will pay a high price.

If you are passionate about trading and never try it, then you will live your life wondering what might have been.


# Furiously Happy (Jenny Lawson)

The great thing about this cover is that when you’re holding the book up to read it, it will look like the bottom of your face has been replaced with an ecstatic raccoon smile. That way you look friendly and also terrifying to anyone passing by, which is nice because then people won’t bother you while you’re reading.

Everyone has human heads in their closet. Sometimes the heads are secrets, or unsaid confessions, or quiet fears. This book is one of those severed heads.

So if you don’t like the book then maybe you’re just not crazy enough to enjoy it. Either way, you win.

“Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall—rain, assholes, and assorted bullshit.”.

My grandmother used to say, “Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall—rain, assholes, and assorted bullshit.” I’m paraphrasing. But she was right. We all get our share of tragedy or insanity or drama, but what we do with that horror is what makes all the difference.

Clinical depression is a semiregular visitor and anxiety disorder is my long-term abusive boyfriend.

Angry because I had no other emotions left to give.

I’ve HAD IT. I AM GOING TO BE FURIOUSLY HAPPY, OUT OF SHEER SPITE.

Can you hear that? That’s me smiling, y’all. I’m smiling so loud you can fucking hear it. I’m going to destroy the goddamn universe with my irrational joy and I will spew forth pictures of clumsy kittens and baby puppies adopted by raccoons and MOTHERFUCKING NEWBORN LLAMAS DIPPED IN GLITTER AND THE BLOOD OF SEXY VAMPIRES AND IT’S GOING TO BE AWESOME. In fact, I’m starting a whole movement right now. The FURIOUSLY HAPPY movement. And it’s going to be awesome because first of all, we’re all going to be VEHEMENTLY happy, and secondly because it will freak the shit out of everyone that hates you because those assholes don’t want to see you even vaguely amused, much less furiously happy, and it will make their world turn a little sideways and will probably scare the shit out of them. Which will make you even more happy. Legitimately. Then the world tips in our favor. Us: 1. Assholes: 8,000,000. That score doesn’t look as satisfying as it should because they have a bit of a head start. Except you know what? Fuck that. We’re starting from scratch.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder that no one understands. Imagine having a dangerous affliction that even you can’t control or suppress. Imagine all the people living life in peace. Imagine the estate of John Lennon not suing me for using that last line.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder that no one understands. Imagine having a dangerous affliction that even you can’t control or suppress. Imagine all the people living life in peace. Imagine the estate of John Lennon not suing me for using that last line. Then imagine that same (often fatal) disease being one of the most misunderstood disorders … one that so few want to talk about and one that so many of us can never completely escape from.

I’ve often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that “normal” people also might never understand, and that’s what FURIOUSLY HAPPY is all about. It’s about taking those moments when things are fine and making them amazing, because those moments are what make us who we are, and they’re the same moments we take into battle with us when our brains declare war on our very existence. It’s the difference between “surviving life” and “living life.” It’s the difference between “taking a shower” and “teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair.” It’s the difference between being “sane” and being “furiously happy.”.

And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit.

I want this book to help people fighting with mental illness, and also those who have friends and family who are affected by it. I want to show people that there can be advantages to being “a bit touched,” as my grandmother put it. I want my daughter to understand what’s wrong with me and what’s right with me. I want to give hope. I want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, but without selling any Coca-Cola products.


# Classic Computer Science Problems in Python (David Kopec)

It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, trying to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more varied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.

In a world full of halfhearted online tutorials, I think it is important to support the development of books that provide the same author’s voice throughout an extended volume.

If you are one of those programmers who knows Python but does not know CS, this book is for you.

Some say that computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. If that’s the case, then perhaps a programming language.

Some say that computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. If that’s the case, then perhaps a programming language is like a telescope lens. In any event, the term “classic computer science problems” is used here to mean “programming problems typically taught in an undergraduate computer science curriculum.”.

A reader with zero programming experience will get little out of this book, and a programmer with zero Python experience will almost certainly struggle.

Every code listing in this book makes use of Python type hints, also known as type annotations. These annotations are a relatively new feature for the Python language, and they may look intimidating to Python programmers who have never seen them before. They are used for three reasons:.

The goal is to teach problem-solving techniques from first principles, not to “pip install a solution.”.


# Advanced Techniques in Day Trading: A Practical Guide to High Probability Day Trading Strategies and Methods (Andrew Aziz)

Work on simple and well-known strategies, but adjust them over time to complement your own personality and whatever the current market conditions are. Success in trading is not a revolution; it is an evolution.

Simply reading books will, of course, not make you a profitable trader. Profits in trading do not come from reading one or two, or even a dozen books, but, as I explain, profits can come with practice, the right tools and software, and proper ongoing education.

There are many firms, educators, traders and even online scammers who develop these types of computer programs and systems and sell them to traders.

However, because the discretionary trader must make a decision for each trade, traders are more prone to emotional trading and acts of self-deception, such as falling in love with a trade, that will often result in a failure to follow their trading plan.

I'm always saying that trading is a career and a business. And in no career and in no business can you become profitable in just three months. Look at doctors, lawyers and engineers. They go to school for years and take examinations and serve internships and practice, and practice some more, before they can truly call themselves professionals. They are all long and challenging processes that take considerably more than three months.

Typical education cost for a trader is between $1,000 to $2,000 including several months of practice trading in a simulator.

An education or training program is an investment that you make, and maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. If it doesn't, it's not the end of the world for you.

Knowing how to manage expectations is extremely important, especially for beginner traders.

My desire is to try to save traders from themselves.

When our ancestors originally studied the sky above them, they saw what appeared to be a random mass of stars. As they continued.

This means that recognizing trade patterns is important, but execution is equally important.

This is the confusing part for many people. They do not know how to accept a loss, but they still believe the fact that making money in the market is possible.

There is never any money to be made in the obvious conclusions.

Some of the skills to be learned include building a watchlist, finding the Stocks in Play (finding the correct stocks to trade), identifying and practicing strategies, finding patterns, and learning about positions.

Many famous traders say trading is 80% psychology and 20% technical knowledge.

As Dr. Alexander Elder writes in his book, Trading for a Living, successful traders watch their trades and their money as carefully as professional scuba divers watch their.

As Dr. Alexander Elder writes in his book, Trading for a Living, successful traders watch their trades and their money as carefully as professional scuba divers watch their supply of air.

You have to be significantly above the crowd to win in day trading. Trading is a minus-sum game. Just by entering into the market, you start losing. Your bank charges you a fee for wiring out to fund your trading account. Your broker will charge you an incoming wiring fee for funding the account and then start charging you for their market data, the use of their platform and a commission on each trade that you make. If you do not make enough monthly commissions for them, they will then charge you an inactivity fee.

Day trading is not a hobby. It’s not a weekend pursuit.

Personally believe you must start developing the discipline of a winner. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You have to be “calm, cool and collected” as the saying goes. You have to somehow find a way to control your emotions.

While risk-taking in trading needs to be carefully and rationally managed, an excessive avoidance of risk can be a major roadblock to success.

Greed is probably a more common occupational hazard in trading, especially among novice traders.

My trading career has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Resilience is one of the greatest psychoanalytic puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct. To get the exact answer, we have to look more deeply into the human psyche.

Why do some people experience real hardships but do not lose their strength?.

People react very differently to challenges in life. In 1983, a talented young guitarist, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of his newly formed band in the worst possible way. The band had just been signed to a record deal to record their first album. But a couple of days before the recording was to begin, without any warning, discussion, or a dramatic blowout, the band asked Dave to leave. He had to go back to his hometown the same day. He sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York and kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now? By the time the bus hit L.A., Dave had gotten over this bad experience and self-pity and vowed to start a new band. He decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision. He worked hard, he spent months recruiting the best musicians he could find, he wrote dozens of songs, and he practiced religiously. The combination of anger and ambition eventually led him to form the legendary heavy metal band Megadeth which sold 38 million plus albums and toured the world many times over. Today, Dave Mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavy metal music. The band Dave was fired from was Metallica, one of the best-selling bands ever. Although he never reached the same success as Metallica, he did put his life back on track. This is resilience at work.

Resilience is something you realize you have after the fact.

I recently watched a movie on Netflix, The Founder, about the life of the legendary Roy Kroc, the middle-aged and below average milkshake salesperson who began to build the McDonald’s empire at the age of.

“Now, I know what you're thinkin'. How the heck does a 52-year-old, over-the-hill milkshake machine salesman... build a fast food empire with 16,000 restaurants, in 50 states, in 5 foreign countries... with an annual revenue of in the neighborhood of $700,000,000.00... “One word... PERSISTENCE. “Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.”.

.

The first window is the Top List, which has six columns, with the first three columns for Nasdaq highest volume, highest gainers and highest losers.

Price action in the form of white/red candlesticks Volume of shares being traded and average volume line 9 Exponential Moving Average of price (9 EMA) and 20 Exponential Moving Average of price (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average of price (50 SMA) and 200 Simple Moving Average of price (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price Last sale price.

VWAP lets you know if the buyers or the sellers are in control of the price action.

Level 2 is known to be a “leading indicator”, which means it shows activity before a trade happens. Moving averages, charts and most of the other indicators are known as “lagging indicators”, meaning they provide information after the trades take place.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5 cents and your upside is 25 cents, or your downside is 20 cents and your upside is one dollar. That’s 1:5.

A Stock in Play that is about to trade higher or lower from its present price. Stocks in Play move, and their moves are predictable and frequent and catchable. A good intraday stock offers numerous and excellent risk/reward opportunities. Every day, there are new stocks that are in play. Trading Stocks in Play allow you to be the most efficient with your buying power. They often offer much better risk/reward opportunities intraday and allow you to execute your ideas and trading rules with more consistency. Trading the right Stocks in Play can help you to combat algorithmic programs. What are Stocks in Play? They could be, in no particular order: A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off You need to keep in mind that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume. Some stocks like Apple Inc. (ticker: AAPL) will on average trade millions and millions of shares each day, while other stocks on average might trade only 500,000 shares each day. Does this mean you should trade AAPL only? No. High volume will be relative from one stock to another. You don’t look just for high total volume. There are some stocks that regularly trade with high volume. What.

What are Stocks in Play? They could be, in no particular order: A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off.

If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing. When the market is weak, it means that the majority of stocks are selling off. It does not matter if it is Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Exxon Mobil. When the market is strong, the prices of the majority of stocks will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume independent of the overall market are referred to as Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are being traded independently of their sector and the overall market.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play - high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

Based on my experience, trading and losing on low float stocks is the number one reason new traders blow up their accounts.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2% Stocks that have traded at least 100,000 shares by 9 a.m. in the pre-market Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares Stocks that have Average True Range (ATR) of at least 50 cents (how much of a range a stock has on average every day) There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

High volume with no volatility in the pre-market is often a sign of “buyout” news. This means ALR has been acquired at an agreed price and although it has gapped up, there will be no trading opportunity during the day.

Buyout gaps are very common in the market, but remember, they are not tradeable. When a company acquires another company, the price is determined and usually there will be no volatility in the price for you to trade on.

This large transaction is called a “block trade”. A block trade, also known as a block order, is an order or trade submitted for the sale or purchase of a large quantity of shares being traded at an arranged price between two parties, sometimes outside of the open markets, to lessen the impact on the price of the stock.

I am often asked by new traders how to make a Gappers watchlist if they do not have a Trade Ideas scanner. In that case, you can make use of one of the free scanners available on the Internet such as www.finviz.com. The DAS platform also has a basic scanner built into it for free use by its subscribers, but it does not allow you to filter and define more sophisticated scanners by changing parameters such as ATR or float. If you have the DAS platform, many of the Gappers watchlist stocks will often also hit the Top List window. For example, Figure 3.13 shows my Gappers watchlist on October 25, 2017 next to my Top List window for that day. As you can see, many Gappers watchlist candidates are actually on the Top List as well, as I marked.

Review the price action of the candidates on both 5-minute and daily charts and look for decent pre-market activity.

A good pre-market activity is relative, but a uniform volume on the pre-market and clean price action on the 5-minute chart is important. Having gradual moves to the upside or downside, establishing clear pre-market levels, and respecting VWAP and moving averages are sufficiently clean price action for me.

This is how I find in real time the low float stocks that are making new highs of the day that meet the following filter criteria: Price range: $1 to $10 The volume today is at least 200,000 shares The float is a maximum of 10,000,000 shares The volume in the last 5 minutes is between 400% and 2,000% of normal The current volume is at least 2 times the normal average volume The 15-minute range is at least $0.30.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traditionally, RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a stock is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore may be prime for a reversal or pull back. On the other hand, an RSI reading of 30 or below can indicate an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal.

On the other hand, an RSI reading of 30 or below can indicate an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal to the upside.

I set my RSI Extreme Scanner in a way that only shows stocks which are entering an extreme range of either above 90 or below 10 within a 5–minute time frame.

I have found that almost all of the stocks which hit my RSI Extreme Scanner during the day are Stocks in Play. I may not necessarily trade them all, but they often do provide good trading opportunities.

If you overtrade, your broker will become richer, and you will become, well, broker! Remember, your goal is to trade well, not to trade often.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

Support and resistance levels are very important reference points because so many traders recognize them and believe in their significance. It’s herd mentality 101.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days. I use a tool called PriceMarker, which is referred to as a Study in my DAS platform, to automatically put four levels on my chart for any stock that I am watching.

Previous day close plus yesterday’s high, yesterday’s low, two days ago high and two days ago low. These are very, very important to support and resistance.

Stocks in Play often have clean pre-market activity, and that is one of my important criteria for shortlisting the Gappers for my final watchlist.

Two powerful levels for day traders are the high and the low of the pre-market activity.

Moving averages on higher time frames such as daily charts and 5-minute charts are important support and resistance levels, especially the larger moving averages such as 50 SMA and 200 SMA.

Please note that as a rule of thumb, the higher the time frame and the higher the moving averages are, the stronger the support and resistance levels will be. A 200 SMA on a daily chart is perhaps the strongest support and resistance level. Moving averages on 1-minute charts on the other hand tend to be less strong.

Daily chart >> 5-minute chart >> 1-minute chart 200 SMA >> 50 SMA >> 20 EMA >> 9 EMA.

A large wick to the upside or downside on a daily chart will immediately catch my attention.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value. Sometimes it is not clear which line is the optimum line, and in those situations all you can do is just draw the best that you can.

For day trading, it is better to draw support and resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support and resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. Swing traders often ignore those wicks on daily charts. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on.

Support and resistance lines on daily charts are not always easy to find, and at times you will not be able to draw anything clear. If I cannot see anything clear, I don’t have to draw anything. There is a good chance that other traders will also not see those lines clearly and therefore there is no point in forcing myself to draw support and resistance lines. In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or moving averages or other levels that I earlier discussed.


# The Quick Python Book, Third Edition (Naomi Ceder)

I’ve come to use Python just to help myself think about a problem more clearly.

The fact that Python associates types with objects and not with variables means that the interpreter doesn’t help you catch variable type mismatches.

In the past decade the numbers and types of mobile devices have exploded, and smartphones, tablets, phablets, Chromebooks, and more are everywhere, running on a variety of operating systems. Python isn’t a strong player in this space. While options exist, running Python on mobile devices isn’t always easy, and using Python to write and distribute commercial apps is problematic.

# Pro Git (Scott Chacon;Ben Straub)

When you’re done, you may feel the need to spend a quiet moment pondering how you lived before Git branching was part of your life.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

By default Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with git init.

Your default branch name.


# Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series) (Zed A. Shaw)

# Price Action Breakdown: Exclusive Price Action Trading Approach to Financial Markets (Laurentiu Damir)

You will stop fishing for the magic indicator or some sort of automated program that will do all the trading for you and provide good returns.

I do not recommend trading a timeframe lower than a zoomed out five minutes one because it will expose you to the daily trading noise and random movements, to the point where your trading will start to resemble gambling.

If you have read something of mine in the past you know that I do not recommend using technical indicators in your trading as they are all constructed on past price action that you can see with your naked eye on the chart. They are all lagging. The best indicator you can have is your brain analyzing the raw price movements.

There are times when every market has a story to tell. And you have to train yourself to be both a great observer and listener, or you will be too late to enjoy the full story that will be told.

As I was reading it again for umpteenth time, I noticed on page three it reads that Livingston used to journal both “the determination of (probable price) movements” as well as “assorted record of my hits and misses.”.

It is a textbook for speculation.

He had made and lost more fortunes by the age of 25 than most people will see in a lifetime,.

Panache of an artful storyteller rather than with the scolding finger of a professor,.

Through the voice of the Livingston character, Lefevre reaches out through time to remind us, with the panache of an artful storyteller rather than with the scolding finger of a professor, that there never is anything new on Wall Street, because speculation is as old as the hills; that in a bull market you must trade with the bulls, while in a bear market you must trade with the bears; that anticipation and fast reaction are the trader’s key assets; that you should never argue with the tape; that you do not know until you bet; that the game teaches you the game; and much more.

Human nature condemns virtually everyone to being a sucker.

There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral.

When there are a lot of people willing and able to do a job, that job generally doesn’t pay well. This is one of four meaningful factors that determine a wage. The others are the specialized skills a job requires, the unpleasantness of a job, and the demand for services that the job fulfills.

Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school; but it doesn’t seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start or frequently read to or plopped in front of the television.

An overbearing parent is a lot like a political candidate who believes that money wins elections—whereas in truth, all the money in the world can’t get a candidate elected if the voters don’t like him to start with.

To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions.

British aid amounts to less than 0.02 per cent of India’s GDP, and somewhat less than the Government of India spends on fertilizer subsidies—an appropriate metaphor, perhaps, for the aid argument.

A digression here: Personally, I am far from convinced that the British system is suited to India. The parliamentary democracy we have adopted involves the British perversity of electing a legislature to form an executive: this has created a unique breed of legislator, largely unqualified to legislate, who has sought election only in order to wield (or influence) executive power. It has produced governments obliged to focus more on politics than on policy or performance. It has distorted the voting preferences of an electorate that knows which individuals it wants but not necessarily which policies. It has spawned parties that are shifting alliances of individual interests rather than the vehicles of coherent sets of ideas. It has forced governments to concentrate less on governing than on staying in office, and obliged them to cater to the lowest common denominator of their coalitions. It is time for a change.

(It was the experience of being expelled from one of them, Watson’s Hotel in Bombay, that led Jamsetji Tata to build one of the world’s finest and most opulent hotels of its time, the Taj Mahal, which was open to Indians.).

Colonialism was all about. Cultural forms in societies newly classified as “traditional” were reconstructed and transformed by this knowledge, which created new categories and oppositions between colonizers and colonized, European and Asian, modern and traditional, West and East… As India was anthropologized in the colonial interest, a narrative about its social formation, its political capacity, and its civilizational inheritance began increasingly to tell the story of colonial inevitability and of the permanence of British imperial rule.’ Bernard Cohn, a scholar of British colonialism.

Nearly every kind of manufacture or product known to the civilized world—nearly every kind of creation of man’s brain and hand, existing anywhere, and prized either for its utility or beauty—had long been produced in India. India was a far greater industrial and manufacturing nation than any in Europe or any other in Asia. Her textile goods—the fine products of her looms, in cotton, wool, linen and silk—were famous over the civilized world; so were her exquisite jewellery and her precious stones cut in every lovely form; so were her pottery, porcelains, ceramics of every kind, quality, color and beautiful shape; so were her fine works in metal—iron, steel, silver and gold. She had great architecture—equal in beauty to any in the world. She had great engineering works. She had great merchants, great businessmen, great bankers and financiers. Not only was she the greatest shipbuilding nation, but she had great commerce and trade by land and sea which extended to all known civilized countries. Such was the India which the British found when they came.

Whereas an Akbar might have used such technologies to fuse his diverse people together, the British used them to separate, classify and divide.

Governor General Warren Hastings hired eleven pandits to create what became known as the Code of Gentoo Laws or the Ordinations of the Pandits.

The result was a remarkable preponderance of Brahmins in positions of importance in the British Raj. Brahmins, who were no more than a tenth of the population, occupied over 90 per cent of the positions available to Indians in government service, except the most menial ones; they dominated the professions open to Indians, especially lawyering and medicine; and they entered journalism and academia, so it was their voices that were heard loudest as the voices of Indian opinion. India had arguably been a far more meritocratic society before the British Raj settled down to enshrine the Brahmins in such a position of dominance.

The Brahmins enjoyed British patronage over other groups and began considering themselves above all other castes, whom the British, internalizing Brahmin prejudice, thought of as lower castes.

The British fondness for taxonomy and social classification continued to be in evidence throughout their rule, and was formalized by means of the census they undertook first in 1872 and then every ten years from 1881, converting it into an ‘ethnographic census’ in 1901.

Whereas prior to British rule the Shudra had only to leave his village and try his fortunes in a different princely state in India where his caste would not have followed him, colonialism made him a Shudra for life, wherever he was.

In British India, this was far more difficult, if not impossible, since entire regiments were constructed on the basis of caste identities.

British even subsumed ancient, and not dishonourable, professions like devadasis (temple dancers) or baijis (court musicians), who in some respects served functions akin to the geishas of Japan, into a rough-and-ready category of ‘prostitutes’, thus casting them out for the first time from respectable society.

Northern India celebrated what was called a ‘Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb’, a syncretic culture that melded the cultural practices of both faiths.

Romila Thapar has recounted how deeply devotional poetry was written by some poets who were born Muslim but worshipped Hindu deities, notably Sayyad Ibrahim, popularly known as Raskhan, whose dohas and bhajans dedicated to Lord Krishna were widely recited in the sixteenth century.

The Mughal court, she points out, became the most impressive patron of the translation of many Sanskrit religious texts into Persian, including the epic Mahabharata (translated as the Razmnamah) and the Bhagavad Gita, with Brahmin priests collaborating on the translations with Persian scholars.

Nor was religion in the past necessarily the overall basis for collective action, let alone political mobilization: caste, community, jati and biradari played their parts. But by encroaching on the terrain of the various communities, thereby invalidating indigenous social relations, the colonial state loosened the bonds that had held them together for generations across these divides.

Acceptance of difference, as Swami Vivekananda famously declared at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, was central to the Indian experience throughout its long civilizational history.

A royal temple symbolized the king’s power in Hindu political thought, and so destroying it signified that king’s utter humiliation.

Other words, invaders’ attacks on temples were politically, rather than religiously, motivated.

The portrayal of Muslims as Islamist idol-breakers, driven to destroy temples because of religious fanaticism, argue both Eaton and Talbot, is far from the truth.

Obviously raiders who came and went like Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori and Nadir Shah were bent on destruction and pillage, but the Muslims who stayed in India attacked temples not to destroy them, but because they valued them and understood their importance.

Islam came to Kerala not by the sword, as it did in northern India, but through traders, travellers and missionaries,.

Islam came to Kerala not by the sword, as it did in northern India, but through traders, travellers and missionaries, who brought its message of equality and brotherhood to the coastal people.

When Allan Octavian Hume founded the Indian National Congress he actively welcomed Indians of all faiths to the organization; its first few presidents included Hindus, Christians, Parsis and Muslims. The British did not approve of Hume’s liberal attitude. (Had they been sincere about empowering a cooperative class of English-educated Indians, they could easily have done so, co-opting these liberal lawyers, as they mostly were, into the British governance of India.) Instead, the British watched the rise to prominence of Congress, a secular body transcending religion, with growing disapproval, and pronounced it a Hindu-dominated organization. They instigated a Muslim nobleman, Nawab Khwaja Salimullah of Dacca, to start a rival organization in 1906 for his co-religionists alone, the Muslim League.

Meanwhile Lord Curzon’s decision in 1905 to partition Bengal, ostensibly for administrative reasons but in reality to create a Muslim-majority province in the east, aroused fierce opposition from all segments of Bengali society and from Indian nationalists everywhere, who saw it as a transparent attempt to divide the country.

In 1916, Motilal Nehru was chosen by the Congress to draft, together with a brilliant young Muslim lawyer called Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the principles that would govern cooperation with the Muslim League. Their work, recognizing the principle that decisions would not be taken affecting the interests and beliefs of a minority community without the agreement of a majority of that community’s representatives, formed the foundation of what was widely hailed as the Lucknow Pact.

The Congress’s leading literary light, the poetess Sarojini Naidu, hailed Jinnah as the ‘ambassador of Hindu–Muslim unity’ and set about editing a compilation of his speeches and writings.

Indeed, for all the British encouragement, the Muslims of India as a whole did not think of their futures as anything but entwined with their Hindu compatriots.

Mahatma Gandhi, upon assuming the leadership of the Congress, also sought to make common cause with Muslim opinion by spearheading a Khilafat agitation in support of Indian Muslim demands to restore the Caliphate in Turkey after the collapse during World War I of the Ottoman empire.

Predominant bias in British officialdom in favour of the Moslem community… Largely as a make-weight against Hindu nationalism’.

Thus, when the Muslim League demanded one of two possible privileges in the five Muslim-majority provinces, either statutory majorities, enshrined in law, with joint electorates, or separate electorates for Muslims the British gave them statutory majorities with separate electorates in their Communal Award, letting the Muslim Leaguers have it both ways.

Ironically, had Indian politics been encouraged to develop as British politics had, along ideological lines, one could have seen the emergence of a conservative party and a socialist one, with some liberals in between; these tendencies were all present among Indian public men. This kind of conventional political contention could have kept India united, with Jinnah and Nehru becoming the Disraeli and Gladstone of their era in an emerging Indian Dominion. But.

The British-promoted cleavage also divided the Muslim community. A prominent Deobandi cleric who opposed the communal polarization promoted by the British and fought against the League’s Pakistan project, Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, wrote passionately to a co-religionist as late as 1945: Muslims have been together with the Hindus since they moved to Hindustan. And I have been with them since I was born. I was born and raised here. If two people live together in the same country, same city, they will share [a] lot of things with each other. Till the time there are Muslims in India, they will be together with the Hindus. In the bazaars, in homes, in railways, in trams, buses, lorries, in stations, colleges, post offices, jails, police stations, courts, councils, assembles, hotels, etc. You tell me where and when we don’t meet them or are not together with them? You are a zamindar. Are not your tenants Hindus? You are a trader; you don’t buy and sell from Hindus? You are a lawyer: don’t you have Hindu clients? You are in a district or municipal board; won’t you be dealing with Hindus? Who is not with the Hindus?.

The creation and perpetuation of Hindu–Muslim antagonism was the most significant accomplishment of British imperial policy:.

The great Indian opponent of the British Raj, Mahatma Gandhi, opposed colonial rule in an unusual way: not by violence but by the strength of moral force. Gandhi’s life was, of course, his lesson. He was unique among the statesmen of the twentieth century in his determination not just to live his beliefs but to reject any separation between beliefs and action. Gandhi was a philosopher who was constantly seeking to live out his own ideas, whether they applied to individual self-improvement or social change: his autobiography was typically subtitled The Story of My Experiments with Truth. Truth could not be obtained by ‘untruthful’ or unjust means, which included inflicting violence upon one’s opponent. The means had to be worthy of the ends; if they were not, the ends would fail too.

Churchill had strong views on Gandhi. Commenting on the Mahatma’s meeting with the Viceroy of India, 1931, he had notoriously declared: ‘It is alarming and nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half naked up the steps of the viceregal palace, while he is still organising and conducting a campaign of civil disobedience, to parlay on equal terms with the representative of the Emperor-King.’ (Gandhi had nothing in common with fakirs, Muslim spiritual mendicants, but Churchill was rarely accurate about India.) ‘Gandhi-ism and all it stands for,’ declared Churchill, ‘will, sooner or later, have to be grappled with and finally crushed.’ In.

Gandhi ‘should not be released on the account of a mere threat of fasting’, Churchill told the Cabinet. ‘We should be rid of a bad man and an enemy of the Empire if he died.’ He was quite prepared to facilitate the process, suggesting that the Mahatma should be ‘bound hand and foot at the gates of Delhi, and let the viceroy sit on the back of a giant elephant and trample [the Mahatma] into the dirt.’.

‘Pakistan was created by Jinnah’s will and Britain’s willingness’—not by Nehru’s wilfulness.

‘Too long have we been passive spectators of events, the playthings of others. The initiative comes to our people now and we shall make the history of our choice.’.

Jinnah once again insisted that Congress recognize the League as the sole representative of Indian Muslims.

Jinnah declared on 14 November that the killing would not stop unless Pakistan was created.

Policy of appeasement.

Cabinet Mission Plan.

Both Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Nehru agreed that, despite Gandhi’s refusal to contemplate such a prospect, the Congress had no alternative but to agree to partitioning Punjab and Bengal; the option of a loose Indian union including a quasi-sovereign Pakistan would neither be acceptable to the League nor result in a viable government for the rest of India.

There is no question that Nehru and Edwina indeed became close, but it does not seem likely that this had any political impact.

Over a million people died in the savagery that bookended the freedom of India and Pakistan; some 17 million were displaced, and countless properties destroyed and looted. Lines.

Over a million people died in the savagery that bookended the freedom of India and Pakistan; some 17 million were displaced, and countless properties destroyed and looted. Lines meant lives. What Nehru had thought of as a temporary secession of certain parts of India hardened into the creation of two separate and hostile states that would fight four wars with each other and be embroiled in a nuclear-armed, terrorism-torn standoff decades later.

Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.

There were no harsh words for the British, whose Raj was ending at midnight. ‘This is no time…for ill-will or blaming others,’ he added. ‘We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.’.

The British—terrorized by German bombing, demoralized by various defeats and large numbers of their soldiers taken prisoner, shaken by the desertion of Indian soldiers and the mutiny of Indian sailors, shivering in the record cold of the winter of 1945-46, crippled by power cuts and factory closures resulting from a post-War coal shortage—were exhausted and in no mood to focus on a distant empire when their own needs at home were so pressing. They.

They were also more or less broke: American loans had kept the economy afloat and needed to be repaid, and even India was owed a sizable debt. Overseas commitments were no longer sustainable or particularly popular. Exit was the only viable option: the question was what they would leave behind—one India, two or several fragments?.

Is difficult, therefore, to buy the self-serving imperial argument that Britain bequeathed to India its political unity and democracy.

While comparisons of human deaths are always invidious, the 35 million who died of famine and epidemics during the Raj does remind one of the 25 million who died in Stalin’s collectivization drive and political purges, the 45 million who died during Mao’s cultural revolution, and the 55 million who died worldwide during World War II.

Free trade principles (do not interfere with market forces), Malthusian doctrine (growth in population beyond the ability of the land to sustain it would inevitably lead to deaths, thereby restoring the ‘correct’ level of population) and financial prudence (don’t spend money we haven’t budgeted for).

The British tended to base their refusal to intervene in famines with adequate governmental measures on a combination of three sets of considerations: free trade principles (do not interfere with market forces), Malthusian doctrine (growth in population beyond the ability of the land to sustain it would inevitably lead to deaths, thereby restoring the ‘correct’ level of population) and financial prudence (don’t spend money we haven’t budgeted for).

As against this self-exculpation—when you blame a tragedy on everybody, you blame it on nobody—there lies the uncompromising denunciation of a Will Durant: ‘Behind all these as the fundamental source of the terrible famines in India, lies such merciless exploitation, such unbalanced exportation of goods, and such brutal collection of high taxes in the very midst of famine, that the starving peasants cannot pay what is asked for….

Almsgiving,.

Indian almsgiving,.

When some Englishmen of conscience objected and mounted relief operations of their own, the British government threatened them with imprisonment. A Mr MacMinn, who out of his own money distributed grain to the starving, was ‘severely reprimanded, threatened with degradation, and ordered to close the work immediately’.

‘Scores of corpses were tumbled into old wells, because the deaths were too numerous for the miserable relatives to perform the usual funeral rites. Mothers sold their children for a single scanty meal. Husbands flung their wives into ponds, to escape the torment of seeing them perish by the lingering agonies of hunger. Amid these scenes of death, the government of India kept its serenity and cheerfulness unimpaired. The [newspapers] were persuaded into silence. Strict orders were given to civilians under no circumstances to countenance the pretence that civilians were dying of hunger.’.

The facts of British culpability, even at the height of the ‘civilizing mission’ in the late nineteenth century, are overwhelming, but modern-day apologists continue to gloss over it. One, Lawrence James, says in blithe disregard.

Human beings were not the only victims of British-induced famines; cattle died too. It is striking that the export trade in hides and skins rose from 5 million rupees in 1859 to nearly 115 million rupees in 1901, an astonishing increase especially in a culture where the death of a cow was devastating, not only for religious reasons but because cows were crucial to farming, and also served as a means of transportation and as status symbols in rural society.

The loss of cattle directly impacted agricultural productivity, which would take years, if not decades, to be restored to pre-famine levels.

Nothing can excuse the odious behaviour of Winston Churchill, who deliberately ordered the diversion of food from starving Indian civilians to well-supplied British soldiers and even to top up European stockpiles in Greece and elsewhere. ‘The starvation of anyway underfed Bengalis is less serious’ than that of ‘sturdy Greeks’, he argued. Grain for the Tommies, bread for home consumption in Britain (27 million tonnes of imported grains, a wildly excessive amount), and generous buffer stocks in Europe (for yet-to-be-liberated Greeks and Yugoslavs) were Churchill’s priorities, not the life or death of his Indian subjects. When reminded of the suffering of his victims his response was typically Churchillian: The famine was their own fault, he said, for ‘breeding like rabbits’. When officers of conscience pointed out in a telegram to the prime minister the scale of the tragedy caused by his decisions, Churchill’s only reaction was to ask peevishly: ‘why hasn’t Gandhi died yet?’.

Perhaps a more humane view comes from the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh, who has written that the migration of peasants from the Gangetic plains ‘was as if fate had thrust its fist through the living flesh of the land in order to tear away a piece of its stricken heart’. The wrenching of people from their homes amid scenes of desolation and despair was a crime that would haunt the history of British rule in India for generations to come.

Imperialism.

Though the family of Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar surrendered peacefully to the British forces that captured Delhi, they were cruelly decimated. Most of his sixteen sons were tried and hanged, while several were shot in cold blood, after first being stripped of their arms and, of course, their jewels. Atrocities.

He now saw freedom as indivisible from Truth, and he never wavered in his commitment to ridding India of an empire he saw as irremediably evil, even satanic.

The historian A. J. P. Taylor calls the massacre ‘the decisive moment when Indians were alienated from British rule’.

When it was over and the dead and wounded lay in pools of blood, moaning on the ground, Dyer forbade his soldiers to give any aid to the injured. He ordered all Indians to stay off the streets of Amritsar for twenty-four hours, preventing relatives or friends from bringing even a cup of water to the wounded, who were writhing in agony on the ground calling for help.

Dyer was relieved of his command and censured by the House of Commons, but promptly exonerated by the House of Lords and allowed to retire on a handsome pension. Rudyard Kipling, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the poetic voice of British imperialism, hailed him as ‘The Man Who Saved India’.

Famine, forced migration and brutality: three examples of why British rule over India was despotic and anything but enlightened.

Know it is said in missionary meetings that we conquered India.

‘I know it is said in missionary meetings that we conquered India to raise the level of the Indians. That is cant. We conquered India as an outlet for the goods of Britain. We conquered India by the sword, and by the sword we shall hold it. I am not such a hypocrite as to say we hold India for the Indians. We went with a yardstick in one hand and a sword in the other, and with the latter we continue to hold them helpless while we force the former down their throats.’.

‘In the beginning, there were two nations. One was a vast, mighty and magnificent empire, brilliantly organized and culturally unified, which dominated a massive swath of the earth. The other was an undeveloped, semifeudal realm, riven by religious factionalism and barely able to feed its illiterate, diseased and stinking masses. The first nation was India. The second was England.’.

Best satire on England ever !.

The clinching proof of this argument, after all, lies in the fact that despite having had to climb out of the deep socio-economic trough that colonialism had plunged the country into, and despite having made its own mistakes in the years after Independence, India has become the world’s third-largest economy in less than seven decades since the British left, and is currently its fastest-growing one; it has also piled up an impressive list of ‘modern’ distinctions including that of being the first country in the world to have successfully sent a spacecraft into Mars orbit at the first attempt (a feat even the US could not accomplish and one which China and Japan have failed trying to do).

In 1912, therefore, the British passed an Act of Parliament, explicitly making it impossible for Indian workshops to design and manufacture locomotives. The Act prohibited Indian factories from doing the work they had successfully done for three decades; instead, they were only allowed to maintain locomotives imported from Britain and the industrialized world.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

The colleges, like the British schools in India, heavily emphasized rote learning, the regurgitation of which was what the examinations tested.

Professor Gauri Vishwanathan has done pioneering work on the role of the study of English literature in colonial India as a means of socializing and co-opting Indian elites during the early nineteenth century. Indeed, she argues that the very idea of English literature as a subject of study was first devised by the British in India to advance their colonial interests. It was not only that the English felt their literature would be a way of striking awe and respect for British civilization into the minds and hearts of the colonized Indians; it was also that the British colonists considered many of the great works of Indian literature to be ‘marked with the greatest immorality and impurity’—and that included Kalidas’s Shakuntala, described by Horace Wilson, the major nineteenth-century Sanskrit scholar, as the jewel of Indian literature, but disapproved of as a suitable text for study in Indian schools and colleges in British India.

Who made no bones about their convictions.

(The sun never set on the British empire, an Indian nationalist later sardonically commented, because even God couldn’t trust the Englishman in the dark.).

Gandhi put forward a plan called the Wardha Scheme for Education, which envisaged seven years of basic education for rural children, including vocational training in village handicrafts. It was never fully implemented, but it would certainly have imparted the basics, including literacy in the mother tongue, mathematics, science, history, and physical culture and hygiene, in addition to crafts.

As with all human enterprises, colonialism too brought positives as well as negatives. Not every British official in India was as rapacious as Clive, as ignorantly contemptuous as Macaulay, as arrogantly divisive as Curzon, as cruel as Dyer, or as racist as Churchill.

The British left a society with 16 per cent literacy, a life expectancy of 27, practically no domestic industry and over 90 per cent living below what today we would call the poverty line.

When the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, visited India in 1921, he pointed to a few magnificent buildings, cars and electrical installations and remarked to an Indian accompanying him, ‘We have given you everything here in India! What is it you don’t have?’ And the lowly Indian replied, gently: ‘Self-respect, sir.’.

The fact that, despite all these wrongs and injustices, Indians readily forgave the British when they left, retaining with them a ‘special connection’ that often manifests itself in warmth and affection, says more about India than it does about.

Until it is returned—at least as a symbolic gesture of expiation—it will remain evidence of the loot, plunder and misappropriation that colonialism was really all about. Perhaps that is the best argument for leaving the Kohinoor where it emphatically does not belong—in British hands.

‘Hate begets hate. Violence begets violence,’.

‘We must meet the forces of hate with soul force.’ King.

The power of non-violence rests in being able to say, ‘to show you that you are wrong, I punish myself’.

But that has little effect on those who are not interested in whether they are wrong and are already seeking to punish you whether you disagree with them or not. For them your willingness to undergo punishment is the most convenient means of victory. No wonder Nelson Mandela, who wrote that Gandhi had ‘always’ been ‘a great source of inspiration’, explicitly disavowed non-violence as useless in his struggle against the ruthless apartheid regime.

This subject Gandhi sounds frighteningly unrealistic: ‘The willing sacrifice of.

On this subject Gandhi sounds frighteningly unrealistic: ‘The willing sacrifice of the innocent is the most powerful answer to insolent tyranny that has yet been conceived by God or man. Disobedience to be “civil” must be sincere, respectful, restrained, never defiant, and it must have no ill-will or hatred behind it. Neither should there be excitement in civil disobedience, which is a preparation for mute suffering.’.

Mute suffering is all very well as a moral principle, but it has rarely brought about meaningful change. The sad truth is that the staying-power of organized violence is almost always greater than that of non-violence.

It is increasingly argued that Gandhi could embarrass the British but not overthrow them.

It was when soldiers who had sworn their loyalty to the British Crown rebelled during World War II, and when sailors of the Royal Indian Navy mutinied in 1945 and fired their own cannons at British port installations, that the British realized the game was up. They could jail an old man and allow him to fast, but they could not indefinitely suppress an armed rebellion that had 320 million people behind it. Gandhi won the moral case, the ‘soft power’ battle, in today’s parlance; but even without a military victory, the rebels and mutineers in uniform won the ‘hard-power’ war.

He believed in ‘weaning an opponent from error by patience, sympathy and self-suffering’ but if the opponent believes equally in the justice of his cause, or is conscious of his amorality and unconcerned by it, he is hardly going to accept that he is in ‘error’.

Yet Gandhian solutions have not been found for many of the ills over which he agonized, from persistent sectarian (or ‘communal’) conflict to the ill treatment of Dalits. Instead, his methods (particularly the fast, the hartal or business shutdown, and the deliberate courting of arrest) have been abused and debased by far lesser men in the pursuit of petty sectarian ends.

Gandhism without moral authority is like Marxism without a proletariat.

In a dismaying number of countries, including his own, governments spend more for military purposes than for education and healthcare combined.

Despite the brief popularity of intermediate technology and ‘small is beautiful’, there does not appear to be much room for such ideas in an interdependent world. Self-reliance is too often a cover for protectionism and a shelter for inefficiency in developing countries. The successful and prosperous countries are those who are able to look beyond spinning charkhas to silicon chips—and who give their people the benefits of technological developments which free them from menial and repetitive chores and broaden the horizons of their lives. But today’s urbanizing India is far removed from the idealized, self-sufficient village republics he envisaged, and its enthusiastic embrace of technology would have struck the Mahatma as selling its soul.

While the world was disintegrating into fascism, violence and war, he taught the virtues of truth, non-violence and peace.

We have to realize that sometimes the best crystal ball is a rear-view mirror.

# Mark D. Zoback Reservoir Geomechanics

Once we know an in situ stress ﬁeld in some coordinate system, we can compute stresses in any other.

Because we can choose to describe the state of stress at depth in terms of the principal stresses.

The reason this concept is so important is that because the earth’s surface is in contact with a ﬂuid (either air or water) which cannot support shear tractions, it is a principal stress plane.

We must deﬁne only four parameters to fully describe the state of stress at depth: three principal stress magnitudes, Sv, the vertical stress, corresponding to the weight of the overburden; SHmax, the maximum principal horizontal stress; and Shmin, the minimum principal horizontal stress and one stress orientation, usually taken to be the azimuth of the maximum horizontal compression, SHmax. This obviously helps make stress determination in the crust (as well as description of the in situ stress tensor) a much more tractable problem than it might ﬁrst appear.

Density.

Density logs (upper ﬁgure) can be used to estimate overburden stress at depth (center ﬁgure) or overburden stress gradient (lower ﬁgure). Variability of the density logs, as well as the fact that they are often not obtained.

Extensional (or normal faulting) regime, that.

The orientation of the principal stresses is determined from wellbore observations (Chapter 6), recent geologic indicators and earthquake focal mechanisms.

(which corresponds to Shmin, except in reverse faulting regimes) is obtained from mini-fracs and leak-off tests (Chapter 6).  Pore pressure, Pp, is either measured directly or estimated from geophysical logs or seismic data (Chapter 2).  With these parameters constrained, it is only necessary to constrain SHmax in order to have a reliable estimate of the complete stress tensor as part of a comprehensive geomechanical model of the subsurface. Constraints on the frictional strength of the crust (discussed in Chapter 4) provide general bounds on SHmax (as a function of depth and pore pressure). Having observations of wellbore failures (breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures) allows for much more precise estimates of SHmax. This is discussed for vertical wells in Chapter 7 and for deviated and horizontal wells in Chapter 8. This strategy for in situ stress measurement at depth was ﬁrst employed to estimate the magnitude of the three principal stresses in the Cajon Pass and KTB (Kontinentale Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) scientiﬁc drilling projects (Zoback and Healy 1992; Zoback, Apel et al. 1993; Brudy, Zoback et al. 1997) and is referred to as an integrated stress measurement strategy as it utilizes a wide variety of observations (Zoback, Barton et al. 2003). Geomechanical models determined with these techniques appear in the case histories discussed in Chapters 9–12. Table 1.2 provides an overview of horizontal principal stress determination methods discussed in the chapters that follow. Table 1.2.

The inflow performance relationship (IPR) was presented in a traditional and standardized manner, with the bottomhole flowing pressure on the ordinate of a graph and the corresponding production rate on the abscissa. This type of depiction gives a comprehensive picture of what the reservoir can deliver into the well at a specific time.

Positive-displacement pump performance is evaluated based on the volume of fluid displaced, not the pressure increase generated by the pump, since.

Reservoir engineering in its widest sense overlaps production engineering to a degree. The distinction is frequently blurred both in the context of study (single well versus multiple well) and in the time duration of interest (long term versus short term). Single-well performance, undeniably the object of production engineering, may serve as a boundary condition in a fieldwide, long-term reservoir engineering study. Conversely, findings from the material balance calculations or reservoir simulation further define and refine the forecasts of well performance and allow for more appropriate production engineering decisions.

Term “net height” may be used to account for only the permeable layers in a geologic sequence.

If the water is present but does not flow, the corresponding water saturation is known as “connate” or “interstitial.” Saturations larger than this value would result in free flow of water along with hydrocarbons.

“standard conditions,” that is, usually (but not always) 14.7 psi and 60° F. Flowing oil and gas in the reservoir.

Pressure and temperature are “standard conditions,” that is, usually (but not always) 14.7 psi and 60° F.

An attractive hydrocarbon saturation is the third critical variable (along with porosity and reservoir height) to be determined before a well is tested or completed.

A specific point is the critical point, where the properties of liquid and gas converge. For each temperature less than the critical-point temperature (to the left of Tc in Figure 1-3) there exists a pressure called the “bubble-point” pressure, above which only liquid (oil) is present and below which gas and liquid coexist. For lower pressures (at constant temperature), more gas is liberated.

Reservoirs above the bubble-point pressure are called “undersaturated.”.

If the initial reservoir pressure is less than or equal to the bubble-point pressure, or if the flowing bottomhole pressure is allowed to be at such a value (even if the initial reservoir pressure is above the bubble point), then free gas will at least form and will likely flow in the reservoir. This type of a reservoir is known as “two-phase” or “saturated.” For temperatures larger than the critical.

If the initial reservoir pressure is less than or equal to the bubble-point pressure, or if the flowing bottomhole pressure is allowed to be at such a value (even if the initial reservoir pressure is above the bubble point), then free gas will at least form and will likely flow in the reservoir. This type of a reservoir is known as “two-phase” or “saturated.”.

For temperatures larger than the critical point (to the right of Tc in Figure 1-3), the curve enclosing the two-phase envelop is known as the “dew-point” curve. Outside, the fluid is gas, and reservoirs with these conditions are “lean” gas reservoirs.

The maximum temperature of a two-phase envelop is known as the “cricondentherm.” Between these two points there exists a region where, because of the shape of the gas saturation curves, as the pressure decreases, liquid or “condensate” is formed.

This happens until a limited value of the pressure, after which further pressure reduction results in revaporization. The region in which this phenomenon takes place is known as the “retrograde condensation” region, and reservoirs with this type of behavior are known as “retrograde condensate reservoirs.”.

Petroleum thermodynamic properties are known collectively as PVT (pressure–volume–temperature) properties.

Advances in 3-D and wellbore seismic techniques, in combination with well testing, can increase greatly the region where knowledge of the reservoir extent (with height, porosity, and saturations) is possible.

This factor is simply a ratio of the volume of liquid or gas under reservoir conditions to the corresponding volumes under standard conditions. Thus, for oil,.

Thus the oil formation volume factor is invariably larger than 1, reflecting the swelling of the oil volume because of the gas dissolution. The reader is.

The oil formation volume factor (res bbl/STB), Bo, is not a simple physical property. Instead, it is an empirical thermodynamic relationship allowing for the reintroduction into the liquid (at the elevated reservoir pressure) of all of the gas that would be liberated at standard conditions.

For production engineering calculations these correlations are rarely useful, except when considering matrix stimulation. In this instance, correlations of the altered permeability with the altered porosity after stimulation are useful.

Darcy observed that the flow rate (or velocity) of a fluid through a specific porous medium is linearly proportional to the head or pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet and a characteristic property of the medium. Thus,.

If fluids of other viscosities flow, the permeability must be divided by the viscosity and the ratio k/μ is known as the “mobility.”.

Matrix stimulation is intended to recover or even improve the near-wellbore permeability. (There is damage associated even with stimulation. It is the net effect that is expected to be beneficial.) Hydraulic fracturing, today one of the most widely practiced well-completion techniques, alters the manner by which fluids flow to the well; one of the most profound effects is that near-well radial flow and the damage associated with it are eliminated.

Contamination of the produced fluid from the other formations or the loss of fluid into other formations can be envisioned readily in an open-hole completion.

If no zonal isolation or wellbore stability problems are present, the well can be open hole. A.

Slotted liners can be used if a cemented and cased well is not deemed necessary and are particularly common in horizontal wells where cementing is more difficult.

Finally, to combat the problems of sand or other fines production, screens can be placed between the well and the formation. Gravel packing can be used as an additional safeguard and as a means to keep permeability-reducing fines away from the well.

If the bottomhole pressure is sufficient to lift the fluids to the top, then the well is “naturally flowing.” Otherwise, artificial lift is indicated.

Another technique is to reduce the density of the fluid in the well and thus to reduce the hydrostatic pressure.

Both the IPR and the VFP relate the wellbore flowing pressure to the surface production rate.

The IPR represents what the reservoir can deliver, and the VFP represents what the well can deliver.

The intersection of the IPR with the VFP yields the well deliverability, an expression of what a well will actually produce for a given operating condition. The role of a petroleum production engineer is to maximize the well deliverability in a cost-effective manner.

.

The concept of the dimensionless productivity index combines flow geometry and skin effects, and can be calculated for any well by measuring flow rate and pressure (reservoir and flowing bottomhole) and some other basic but important reservoir and fluid data.

A negative skin effect can be imposed if a successful hydraulic fracture is created.

Finally, more favorable well geometry such as horizontal or complex wells can result in much higher values of JD.

Increasing the drawdown (p – pwf) by lowering pwf is the other option available to the production engineer to increase well deliverability.

While the IPR remains the same, reduction of the flowing bottomhole pressure would increase the pressure gradient (p – pwf) and the flow rate, q, must increase accordingly.

Flowing bottomhole pressure may be lowered by minimizing the pressure losses between the bottomhole and the separation facility (by, for example, removing unnecessary restrictions, optimizing tubing size, etc.), or by implementing or improving artificial lift procedures. Improving well deliverability by optimizing the flow system from the bottomhole location to the surface production facility is a major role of the production engineer.

Well performance evaluation and enhancement are the primary charges of the production engineer.

The measurement of (or sometimes, simply the understanding of) the rate-versus-pressure drop relationships for the flow paths from the reservoir to the separator; (2).

Well testing, which evaluates the reservoir potential for flow and, through measurement of the skin effect, provides information about flow restrictions in the near-wellbore environmental; and.

Production logging measurements or measurements of pressure, temperature, or other properties by permanently installed downhole instruments, which can describe the distribution of flow into the wellbore, as well as diagnose other completion-related problems.

Chapters 1–10 describe the workings of the reservoir and well systems.

Well deliverability analysis predicts the wellbore flowing pressure for a given surface flowrate.

This expression assumes a single-phase fluid flowing and saturating the reservoir.

Steady-state performance means that all parameters, including flow rate and all pressures, are invariant with time.

For a vertical well draining a region with radius re, this requires that the pressure at the well boundary, pe, and the bottomhole flowing pressure, pwf, are constant with time. Practically, the boundary pressure, pe, for a production well can remain constant only in the presence of pressure maintenance, either by natural water influx from an aquifer or by injection to maintain pressure in the reservoir.

A reservoir being waterflooded is the most common situation for which steady-state behavior approximates the actual production well conditions.

Near-wellbore region is extremely important in well production because that is where much of the pressure drop occurs.

One of the main purposes of production engineering is to maximize the productivity index in a cost-effective manner, that is, to increase the flow rate for a given driving force (drawdown) or to minimize the drawdown for a given rate.

In reservoirs where the viscosity is very large (μ > 100 cp), thermal recovery may be indicated to reduce the viscosity.

These ratios indicate that the drainage area assigned to a well has a small impact on the production rate.

The diffusivity equation describes the pressure profile in an infinite-acting, radial reservoir, with a slightly compressible and constant viscosity fluid (undersaturated oil or water).

The pressure at the outer boundary is no longer constant but instead declines at a constant rate with time, as does the pressure at every point in the well drainage volume. That is, ∂p/∂t = constant everywhere.

Because the pressure profile is not changing, this condition is often referred to as “pseudosteady state.”.

If the required bottomhole flowing pressure to deliver a certain inflow is smaller than the tubing pressure difference caused by a fluid with a given flowing gradient, then artificial lift may be employed.

For gas lift, gas is injected continuously or intermittently at selected location(s) along the production string, resulting in a reduction in density of the mixture in the tubing, and thus reducing the hydrostatic component of the pressure difference from the bottom to the top of the well. The.

This pressure drawdown must not violate restrictions for sand control and water or gas coning.

Gas lift can only be applied when hydrostatic pressure drop is the problem of wellbore flow, not frictional pressure drop.

Large amounts of gas injected into the well will affect the separation facilities at the top.

There exists a limit gas–liquid ratio (GLR) above which the pressure difference in the well will begin to increase because the reduction in the hydrostatic pressure will be offset by the increase in the friction pressure.

The positioning of the gas-lift valves and their number is a matter of wellbore hydraulics optimization.

To increase field production, well improvement can be more effective than infill drilling, especially when the new wells are just as suboptimum as existing wells.

Optimized well completions do not sacrifice ultimate field recovery as long as they are achieved with adequate reservoir pressure support from either natural gas cap or water drive mechanisms or through injection wells.

In particular, widespread use of horizontal wells and much broader application of hydraulic fracturing have changed the face of production practices and justified critical updating of the text.

To simplify the presentation of realistic examples, data for three characteristic reservoir types—an undersaturated oil reservoir, a saturated oil reservoir, and a gas reservoir—are presented in the Appendixes. These data sets are used throughout the book.

Petroleum production involves two distinct but intimately connected general systems: the reservoir, which is a porous medium with unique storage and flow characteristics; and the artificial structures, which include the well, bottomhole, and wellhead assemblies, as well as the surface gathering, separation, and storage facilities. Production engineering is that part.

Petroleum production involves two distinct but intimately connected general systems: the reservoir, which is a porous medium with unique storage and flow characteristics; and the artificial structures, which include the well, bottomhole, and wellhead assemblies, as well as the surface gathering, separation, and storage facilities.

In distinguishing production engineering from, for example, reservoir engineering, the focus is often on specific wells and with a short-time intention, emphasizing production or injection optimization. In contrast, reservoir engineering takes a much longer view and is concerned primarily with recovery. As such, there may be occasional conflict in the industry, especially when international petroleum companies, whose focus is accelerating and maximizing production, have to work with national oil companies, whose main concerns are to manage reserves and long-term exploitation strategies.

Modern formation evaluation provides a composite reservoir description through three-dimensional (3-D) seismic, interwell log correlation and well testing. Such description leads to the identification of geological flow units, each with specific characteristics. Connected flow units form a reservoir.

There is little doubt that the best petroleum engineers are those who understand the geological processes of deposition, fluid migration, and accumulation. Whether a reservoir is an anticline, a fault block, or a channel sand not only dictates the amount of hydrocarbon present but also greatly controls well performance.

Ordinarily, there would be only one set of optimum directions.

The porosity of the reservoir can be measured based on laboratory techniques using reservoir cores or with field measurements including logs and well tests.

Temperature, except in the case of high-rate gas wells, is for all practical purposes constant.

One of the purposes of cementing is to support the casing, but at formation depths the most important reason is to provide zonal isolation.

From Equation (2-25) and substitution of the appropriate variables in Appendix A, the well production rate is given by For t = 2 months, for Equation (2-27) the production rate q = 627 STB/d.

Here value of B and Mu are to be taken at initial condition instead of bubble point.

Material balance calculations presented in Chapter 10 combine depletion mechanisms with inflow relationships and lead to forecasts of well performance and cumulative production.

Smaller values denote damage, and larger values denote stimulation,.

Even if they are assigned regular geographic drainage areas, these are distorted after production commences, either because of the presence of natural boundaries or because of lopsided production rates in adjoining wells. The drainage area is then shaped by the assigned production duty of a particular well.

All well deliverability equations relate the well production rate and the driving force in the reservoir, that is, the pressure difference between the initial, outer boundary or average reservoir pressure and the flowing bottomhole pressure.

If the bottomhole pressure is given, the production rate can be obtained readily. However, the bottomhole pressure is a function of the wellhead pressure, which, in turn, depends on production engineering decisions, separator or pipeline pressures, and so on. Therefore, what a well will actually produce must be the combination of what the reservoir can deliver and what the imposed wellbore hydraulics would allow.

In petroleum reservoirs, however, water is always present at least as connate water, denoted as Swc. Thus, in all previous equations in this chapter the permeability should be considered as effective, and it would be invariably less (in certain cases significantly less) than the one obtained from core flooding or other laboratory techniques using a single fluid.

These effective permeability values are related to the “relative” permeability values (also rock properties) by.

Relative permeability values are determined in the laboratory and are characteristic of a given reservoir rock and its saturating fluids. It is not a good practice to use relative permeability values obtained for one reservoir to predict the performance of another.

Such a well is often referred to as a “stripper” with the production rates of less than 10 STB/d of oil.

The ratio qw/qo is referred to as the water–oil ratio.

If the pressure, pe, at the drainage boundary can be approximated as being constant, the steady-state equation should be used. If there is no effect of a boundary felt at the well, transient flow is occurring. Finally, if the boundary at re is a no-flow boundary being felt at the well, the well performance is pseudosteady-state.

Expansion of oil itself as a means of recovery is a highly inefficient mechanism because of the oil’s small compressibility. It is likely that even in the best of cases (the issue is addressed in Chapter 10), if the bottomhole pressure is above the bubble-point pressure, as is the case for heavy oil, a very small fraction of the original-oil-in-place would be recovered.

The gas cases there is a much more pronounced reduction in the temperature along the path, reflecting Joule-Thomson expansion effects associated with gas flow. Solid lines connote single-phase flow.

Contained within a reservoir with potential lateral heterogeneities or discontinuities (sealing faults), vertical boundaries (shale lenses), and anisotropies (stress or permeability).

Knowing that formation brines are good conductors of electricity (i.e., they have poor resistivity) and hydrocarbons are the opposite, a measurement of this electrical property in a porous formation of sufficient height can detect the presence of hydrocarbons.

They proved to be successful in a great number of applications which include thin reservoirs (h < 50 ft), heavy oil, tight formations (k < 0.1 md) with multiple hydraulic fractures, highly heterogeneous reservoirs, or even thick reservoirs with good vertical permeability, kV. Figure 5-1 presents the drainage pattern of a horizontal well with a length, L.

They proved to be successful in a great number of applications which include thin reservoirs (h < 50 ft), heavy oil, tight formations (k < 0.1 md) with multiple hydraulic fractures, highly heterogeneous reservoirs, or even thick reservoirs with good vertical permeability, kV. Figure 5-1 presents the drainage pattern of a horizontal well with a length, L. The concept of horizontal wells is extending the contact with the reservoir, thus changing the drainage pattern from radial flow in vertical wells to a combination of radial, linear, and elliptical flows. Reducing water or gas coning is another main benefit of horizontal wells.

Of particular importance in the production from horizontal wells is the horizontal-to-vertical permeability anisotropy.

Sufficient vertical permeability is required for a horizontal well to be beneficial. Low vertical permeability or discontinuities in vertical permeability may render horizontal wells unattractive in relatively thick formations.

A well that is drilled normal to the larger horizontal permeability direction would be a better producer than one drilled in an arbitrary direction or normal to the smaller horizontal permeability. The larger this permeability anisotropy, the more important.

A well that is drilled normal to the larger horizontal permeability direction would be a better producer than one drilled in an arbitrary direction or normal to the smaller horizontal permeability. The larger this permeability anisotropy, the more important the well azimuth becomes.

Stress measurements in the pilot hole can identify the maximum and minimum horizontal stress directions. While different correlations exist between stress and permeability, almost always stress and permeability directions coincide: the maximum horizontal stress orientation is along maximum permeability and the minimum horizontal stress is along the minimum permeability. Therefore, a horizontal well that is not intended to be hydraulically fractured should be drilled along the direction of minimum horizontal stress.

In the Joshi model the well is centered in an elliptical-shaped drainage boundary.

The Furui et al. model is based on a geometry of a horizontal well centered in a box-shaped drainage boundary.

The steady-state flow model developed by Joshi (1988) was one of the first analytical models for horizontal well inflow.

Negative skin mainly results from well stimulation, such as matrix acidizing discussed in Chapters 14–16 or hydraulic fracturing discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, and it can also be observed in a highly inclined wellbore. This chapter is mainly about positive skin effects.

Positive skin effects can be created by causes such as partial completion (i.e., a perforated thickness that is less than the reservoir thickness), by inadequate number of flowing perforations or slots, by phase changes (relative permeability reduction to the main fluid), by turbulence, and, of course, by near-wellbore alteration of the natural reservoir permeability.

(scomp)d is the combined effect of the completion and permeability damage surrounding the completion, sc is the skin due to partial completion, and sθ is the deviated well skin effect.

These pseudoskins include all phase- and rate-dependent effects.

All “pseudoskins” are grouped together within the summation sign. These pseudoskins include all phase- and rate-dependent effects.

The rate-dependent effect was discussed in Chapter 4 in conjunction with the turbulence in high-rate gas producers.

(It can also affect very high-rate oil wells with large gas–oil ratios.).

This skin effect is equal to Dq, where D is the non-Darcy coefficient (see Section 4.4).

Phase-dependent skin effects are associated with phase changes because of the near-wellbore pressure gradient.

A similar phenomenon can be observed in the case of gas retrograde condensate reservoirs, where liquid is formed around the well, causing a reduction in gas permeability. This is a particularly adverse occurrence. While the gas that is formed in an oil reservoir will reenter solution at an elevated pressure (e.g., as the pressure builds up when the well is shut in), in the case of a gas condensate reservoir much of the formed condensate will not reenter the gas.

Permeability impairment to gas in gas condensate reservoirs is not eliminated following a shut-in. Thus, after reopening the well, the gas flow rate is still affected by the near-wellbore permeability reduction. A method to combat this skin effect is by the injection of neat natural gas, which may re-dissolve the condensate and displace it into the reservoir. This “huff-and-puff” operation can be repeated periodically.

However, the reader must be alerted here that once a hydraulic fracture is generated, most pretreatment skin effects ((scomp)d, sc, sθ) are bypassed and have no impact on the post-treatment well performance. Phase- and rate-dependent skin effects are either eliminated or contribute in the calculation of the fracture skin effects. In general, it is not correct to add pretreatment skin effects to any post-fracture skin effects.

The smaller the perforated interval, compared to the reservoir height and the less it is centered in the total formation height, the larger the skin effect would be. If the completed interval is 75% of the reservoir height or more, this skin effect becomes negligible.

While partial completion generates a positive skin effect by reducing the well exposure to the reservoir, a deviated well has an opposite impact. The larger the deviation angle, the larger the negative contribution to the total skin effect because of the increased amount of reservoir contact by the wellbore. The skin effect due to well deviation is denoted by sθ.

Deviated well has higher productivity than a vertical well through the same reservoir because of the longer length of wellbore in contact with the formation in the deviated well case. Thus, a skin factor accounting.

A deviated well has higher productivity than a vertical well through the same reservoir because of the longer length of wellbore in contact with the formation in the deviated well case. Thus, a skin factor accounting for this effect will always be negative.

Two factors that are likely to have important influences on partial completion skin effects are the reservoir anisotropy and the location of the completed interval in the reservoir, because the convergence of flow to the completed interval in the vertical direction is the cause of the positive partial completion skin.

The flow geometry in a reservoir containing a horizontal lateral is radial near the well and can be predominantly linear far from the well,.

Vertical well (with no hydraulic fracture), only radial flow is dominant. As a result, while the fully penetrated vertical well is totally insensitive to permeability anisotropy, both vertical and lateral permeability anisotropy is important to the horizontal well productivity, and both impact damage mechanisms.

In general, the effect of near well formation damage for a horizontal well completion is relatively small compared with vertical wells. However, if the reservoir thickness is large and/or vertical permeability is small, radial or elliptical flow becomes dominant and the impact of formation damage on a horizontal lateral can be significant. The importance of formation damage in a horizontal lateral can be determined by comparing the magnitude of the damage and completion skin factor with other terms in a horizontal inflow equation.

Oil and gas wells are completed in a variety of ways, with the most common completions being open-hole completions; cased, perforated completions; slotted or perforated liner completions; and gravel-pack completions.

Modern well perforating is done with perforating guns that are attached either to a wireline or to tubing or coiled tubing.

This pattern allows good perforation density with small phasing.

Helical pattern.

The perforating string contains a cable head, a correlation device, a positioning device, and the perforation guns.

The perforating string contains a cable head, a correlation device, a positioning device, and the perforation guns. The cable head connects the string to the wireline and at the same time provides a weak point at which to disconnect the cable if problems arise. The correlation device is used to identify the exact position with a previously run correlation log, and frequently it locates casing collars. The positioning device orients the shots toward the casing for more optimum perforation geometry. The perforating guns are loaded with shape charges, which consist of the case, the explosive, and the liner, as shown in Figure 6-14. Electric current initiates an explosive wave; the sequences of the detonation process are shown in Figure 6-14. Perforations with a diameter between 0.25 and 0.4 in. and a length between 6 and 12 in. are typically created. Significantly longer perforations can be created with special charges in some formations.

Perforating is often done underbalanced; that is, the pressure in the well is less than the reservoir pressure at the moment the perforations are created.

This facilitates immediate flow-back following the detonation, carrying the debris out of the perforations and resulting in a cleaner perforation cavity. The dimensions, number, and phasing of perforations have a controlling role in well performance.

This facilitates immediate flow-back following the detonation, carrying the debris out of the perforations and resulting in a cleaner perforation cavity. The dimensions, number, and phasing of perforations have a controlling role in well performance.

The impact of horizontal to vertical permeability anisotropy is different for perforations in a horizontal well than in a vertical well. In both cases the pressure drop associated with flow to the perforation cavity depends on the orientation of the perforation relative to the orientation of the permeability anisotropy. Because of the vertical permeability often being significantly lower than the horizontal permeability, the skin factor for a perforated horizontal well completion can be different from that of a vertical well. Perhaps more significantly, a horizontal perforated completion’s productivity depends on the orientation of the perforations relative to the permeability field. In a formation with low vertical permeability (high Iani), perforations oriented up and down will be more productive than perforations oriented horizontally.

When there is formation damage around a cased, perforated completion, the combined effect of the perforation skin factor and the damage skin factor can be much greater than the sum of these separate effects. This is because the converging flow to the perforations creates a high-pressure drop if the permeability is reduced in this region.

Slotted or perforated liners are commonly used to complete horizontal and multilateral wells.

If these slots or perforations are plugged, or if there is formation damage in the few inches near the openings where the flow is converging, very high skin factors can result.

If these slots or perforations are plugged, or if there is formation damage in the few inches near the openings where the flow is converging, very high skin factors can result. Slotted or perforated liners are placed in horizontal wellbores, but not cemented in place. If the borehole is very stable so that the formation does not collapse around the liner, the well should behave like an openhole completion, and the simple Hawkins’ formula can describe the skin factor if there is formation damage present. If the formation deforms to contact the liner, flow convergence to the slots or perforations can lead to much higher completion skin factors.

For cased and perforated well completions with efficient perforating (i.e., sp < 0), skin factors are lower than for an open-hole completion. The perforations extending beyond the damage zone create flowpaths through the damage zone so that the effect of formation damage becomes less important.

Gravel pack completions are commonly used in poorly consolidated formations to prevent sand production.

Two types are common, open-hole and cased-hole gravel packs,.

This equation shows that as long as the permeability of the gravel is high compared with the formation permeability, an open-hole gravel pack will not restrict production.

The flow to the gravel-packed cavity extending into the formation is analogous to the flow to a perforated completion or to the flow to a perforated liner completion, depending on the lengths of the perforations and the permeability of the gravel packed in the perforation tunnel. If the perforations are very short or the permeability of the gravel in the perforation tunnels is low, the completion will behave essentially like a perforated liner; longer perforations containing high permeability gravel result in the completion behavior of a cased, perforated well.

Formation damage can be caused by plugging of the pore spaces by solid particles, by mechanical crushing or disaggregation of the porous media, or by fluid effects such as the creation of emulsions or changes in relative permeability.

When fines are moving through a porous medium, they will often be deposited, and if this deposition occurs in the pore throats, a severe reduction in the permeability may result.

Large particles transported to the surface of the porous medium will bridge over the surface pores and form a filter cake external to the porous medium.

Numerous studies have shown that a sudden decrease in salinity of the brine flowing through a sandstone will cause formation damage by dispersing clay particles. This phenomenon, called water sensitivity, depends on the cations present in the brine, the pH, and the rate of salinity change. In general, monovalent cations are much more damaging than divalent or trivalent cations; the water sensitivity is greatest for NaCl brines and decreases in the order Na+ > K+ > NH4+. The higher the pH, the more sensitive the porous medium will be to salinity changes.

Asphaltenes are high-molecular-weight aromatic and napthenic compounds that are thought to be colloidally dispersed in crude oils (Schechter, 1992). This colloidal state is stabilized by the presence of resins in the crude oil; when these resins are removed, the asphaltenes can flocculate, creating particles large enough to cause formation damage. Chemical changes to the crude oil that reduce the resin concentration can thus lead to asphaltene deposition in the formation.

The most common organic species that cause formation damage are waxes (paraffins) and asphaltenes. Waxes are long-chain hydrocarbons that precipitate from certain crude oils when the temperature is reduced, or the oil composition changes because of the.

The most common organic species that cause formation damage are waxes (paraffins) and asphaltenes. Waxes are long-chain hydrocarbons that precipitate from certain crude oils when the temperature is reduced, or the oil composition changes because of the liberation of gas as the pressure is reduced.

If a water-wet formation is changed to oil-wet around the wellbore, the oil-relative permeability may be greatly reduced in the near-wellbore region.

The most common source of formation damage in wells is the drilling process. Drilling damage results from the invasion of the formation by drilling fluid particles and drilling fluid filtrate. The damage caused by drilling fluid particles is likely to be the more severe.

Damage to the formation during well completion operations can be caused by invasion of completion fluids into the formation, by cementing, by perforating, or by well stimulation techniques.

It is recommended that completion fluids contain no more than 2 ppm of solids of a size less than 2 μm.

An alternative to underbalanced perforating to obtain clean perforations is to perforate with extreme overbalance.

In this technique the pressure in the wellbore is well above the fracturing pressure at the moment the perforations are created, with wellbore pressure gradients typically greater than 1.0 psi/ft. Additionally, the wellbore and/or tubing are partially filled with gas so that the high pressure is maintained for a short duration after the perforations are created.

Well stimulation fluids, though intended to increase the productivity of a well, can cause formation damage themselves by solids invasion of the formation or precipitation. The potential for damage from stimulation fluids is discussed in the chapters on well stimulation.

Injection wells are susceptible to formation damage caused by the injection of solid particles,.

Injection wells are susceptible to formation damage caused by the injection of solid particles, by precipitation due to incompatibility of injected and formation water, or by the growth of bacteria. Solids injection is always a danger if the injected water is not well filtered; filtration to remove all particles larger than 2 μm is recommended.

The most common problem of this type is the injection of water with relatively high concentrations of sulfate or carbonate ions into formations with divalent cations, such as calcium, magnesium, or barium present.

In other words, the fact that no precipitation occurs when a sample of formation water is mixed with a sample of injection water is not sufficient to guarantee that no precipitation will occur in the formation.

A light gas reservoir is one that contains primarily methane with some ethane and traces of higher molecular-weight gases.

A rich or heavy gas reservoir may have a gravity equal to 0.75 or, in some rare cases, higher than 0.9. Such gravity would mean a significant concentration of ethane plus propane and butane. In commercial practice, the latter two components are removed and sold as natural gas liquids (NGLs).

A gas with a high content of H2S is often referred to as a “sour” gas.

Natural gas with H2S and/or CO2 is called acid gas.

Otherwise, natural gas without acidic components is called sweet gas.

The formation volume factor relates the reservoir volume to the volume at standard conditions of any hydrocarbon mixture. In the case of a natural gas, the formation volume factor, Bg, can be related with the application of the real gas law for reservoir conditions and for standard conditions.

Wellbore flow can be divided into several broad categories, depending on the flow geometry, the fluid properties, and the flow rate. First, the flow in a wellbore is either single phase or.

Wellbore flow can be divided into several broad categories, depending on the flow geometry, the fluid properties, and the flow rate.

Single phase or multiphase;.

The flow geometry of interest in the wellbores is usually flow through a circular pipe, though flow in an annular space, such as between tubing and casing, sometimes occurs.

PVT behavior and their rheological characteristics, must be considered in describing wellbore flow performance.

Depending on the flow rate and the fluid properties, flow in a wellbore may be either laminar or turbulent, and this will strongly influence the flow behavior.

When the flow is laminar, the fluid moves in distinct laminae, with no fluid motion transverse to the bulk flow direction.

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in circular pipes generally occurs at a Reynolds number of 2100, though this value can vary somewhat depending on the pipe roughness, entrance conditions, and other factors (Govier and Aziz, 1977).

As the viscosity increases, the likelihood of laminar flow also increases.

Laminar flow occurs at relatively high flow rates in wells in which a viscous fluid is being produced or injected.

ΔpPE accounts for the pressure change due to the weight of the column of fluid (the hydrostatic head); it will be zero for flow in a horizontal pipe.

In laminar flow, the friction factor is a simple function of the Reynolds number,.

In turbulent flow, the friction factor may depend on both the Reynolds number and the relative pipe roughness, ε.

In turbulent flow, the friction factor may depend on both the Reynolds number and the relative pipe roughness, ε. The relative roughness is a measure of the size of surface features on the pipe wall protruding into the flow stream compared with the pipe diameter,.

The Fanning friction factor is most commonly obtained from the Moody friction factor chart (Figure 7-7; Moody, 1944). This chart was generated.

The Colebrook-White equation is implicit in ff, requiring an iterative procedure, such as the Newton-Raphson method, for solution.

There are many instances in production operations in which flow in the annular space between a tubing string and a casing string occurs, including injection of gas down the annulus in a gas lift completion, injection of workover fluids down the annulus, and production of gas up the annulus.

Compressibility of the fluid must be considered. When the fluid is compressible, the fluid density and fluid velocity.

To calculate the pressure drop in a gas well, the compressibility of the fluid must be considered. When the fluid is compressible, the fluid density and fluid velocity vary along the pipe, and these variations must be included when integrating the mechanical energy balance equation.

The kinetic energy pressure drop is negligible compared with the potential energy and frictional contributions to the overall pressure drop.

Two-phase flow behavior depends strongly on the distribution of the phases in the pipe, which in turn depends on the direction of flow relative to the gravitational field. In this chapter, upward vertical and inclined flow are described; horizontal and near-horizontal flow are treated in Chapter.

In two-phase flow, the amount of the pipe occupied by a phase is often different from its proportion of the total volumetric flow rate. As an example of a typical two-phase flow situation, consider the upward flow of two phases, α and β, where α is less dense than β, as shown in Figure 7-8. Typically, in upward two-phase flow, the lighter phase (α) will be moving faster than the denser phase (β). Because of this fact, called the holdup phenomenon, the in-situ volume fraction of the denser phase will be greater than the input volume fraction of the denser phase—that is, the denser phase is “held up” in the pipe relative to the lighter phase.

Vβ = volume of denser phase in pipe segment and V = volume of pipe segment. The holdup, yβ, can also be defined in terms of a local holdup, yβl,.

In gas–liquid flow, the holdup of the gas phase, yα, is sometimes called the void fraction.

Input fraction of each phase,.

The input volume fractions, λα and λβ, are also referred to as the “no-slip holdups.”.

Slip velocity is defined as the difference between the average velocities of the two phases.

Slip velocity is not an independent property from holdup, but is simply another way to represent the holdup phenomenon. In order to show the relationship between holdup and slip velocity, we introduce the definition of superficial velocity, usα or usβ, defined as.

The “flow regime” or flow pattern is a qualitative description of the phase distribution.

In gas–liquid, vertical, upward flow, four flow regimes are now generally agreed upon in the two-phase flow literature: bubble, slug, churn, and annular flow.

In this section we consider correlations used to calculate the pressure drop in gas–liquid two-phase flow in wells.

Beggs and Brill correlation is applicable to any pipe inclination and flow direction.

The Beggs and Bill (1973) correlation differs significantly from that of Hagedorn and Brown in that the Beggs and Brill correlation is applicable to any pipe inclination and flow direction. This method is based on the flow regime that would occur if the pipe were horizontal; corrections are then made to account for the change in holdup behavior with inclination.

The Gray correlation was developed specifically for wet gas wells and is commonly used for gas wells producing free water and/or condensate with the gas.

Thus, we must divide the total distance into increments small enough that the flow properties, and hence the pressure gradient, are almost constant in each increment. Summing the pressure drop in each increment, we obtain the overall pressure drop. This stepwise calculation procedure is generally referred to as a pressure traverse calculation. Since both the temperature and.

Thus, we must divide the total distance into increments small enough that the flow properties, and hence the pressure gradient, are almost constant in each increment. Summing the pressure drop in each increment, we obtain the overall pressure drop. This stepwise calculation procedure is generally referred to as a pressure traverse calculation.

The temperature profile is usually approximated as being linear between the surface temperature and the bottomhole temperature, as shown in Figure 7-15.

Pressure traverse calculations can be performed either by fixing the length increment and calculating the pressure drop, or by fixing the pressure drop and finding the depth interval over which this pressure drop would occur (Brill and Beggs, 1978).

Fixing the length interval is often more convenient when programming a pressure traverse calculation for computer solution; fixing the pressure drop increment is more convenient for hand calculations.

For oil production, this facility is typically a two- or three-phase separator;.

For gas production, the facility may be a gas plant, a compressor station, or simply a transport pipeline; and for injection wells,.

The flow regime does not affect the pressure drop as significantly in horizontal flow as it does in vertical flow because there is no potential energy contribution to the pressure drop in horizontal flow.

Most important, the occurrence of slug flow necessitates designing separators or sometimes special pieces of equipment (slug catchers) to handle the large volume of liquid contained in a slug.

These can be classified as three types of regimes: segregated flows, in which the two phases are for the most part separate; intermittent flows, in which gas and liquid are alternating; and distributive flows, in which one phase is dispersed in the other phase.

Segregated flow is further classified as being stratified smooth, stratified wavy (ripple flow), or annular. Stratified smooth flow consists of liquid flowing along the bottom of the pipe and gas flowing along the top of the pipe, with a smooth interface between the phases. This flow regime occurs at relatively low rates of both phases. At higher gas rates, the interface becomes wavy, and stratified wavy flow results. Annular flow occurs at high gas rates and relatively high liquid rates and consists of an annulus of liquid coating the wall of the pipe and a central core of gas flow, with liquid droplets entrained in the gas.

Slug flow consists of large liquid slugs alternating with high-velocity bubbles of gas that fill almost the entire pipe. In plug flow, large gas bubbles flow along the top of the pipe, which is otherwise filled with liquid.

Distributive flow regimes described in the literature include bubble, dispersed bubble, mist, and froth flow. The bubble flow regimes differ from those described for vertical flow in that the gas bubbles in a horizontal flow will be concentrated on the upper side of the pipe. Mist flow occurs at high gas rates and low liquid rates and consists of gas with liquid droplets entrained. Mist flow will often be indistinguishable from annular flow, and many flow regime maps use “annular mist” to denote both of these regimes. “Froth flow” is used by some authors to describe the mist or annular mist flow regime.

Input liquid fraction,.

The correlations we have just examined provide a means of calculating the pressure gradient at a point along a pipeline; to determine the overall pressure drop over a finite length of pipe, the variation of the pressure gradient as the fluid properties change in response to the changing pressure must be considered. The simplest procedure is to evaluate fluid properties at the mean pressure over the distance of interest and then calculate a mean pressure gradient.

When fluids pass through pipe fittings (tees, elbows, etc.) or valves, secondary flows and additional turbulence create pressure drops that must be included to determine the overall pressure drop in a piping network. The effects of valves and fittings are included by adding the “equivalent length” of the valves and fittings to the actual length of straight pipe when calculating the pressure drop.

The flow rate from almost all flowing wells is controlled with a wellhead choke, a device that places a restriction in the flow line.

A variety of factors may make it desirable to restrict the production rate from a flowing well, including the prevention of coning or sand production, satisfying production rate limits set by regulatory authorities, and meeting limitations of rate or pressure imposed by surface equipment.

When gas or gas–liquid mixtures flow through a choke, the fluid may be accelerated sufficiently to reach sonic velocity in the throat of the choke.

When this condition occurs, the flow is called “critical,” and changes in the pressure downstream of the choke do not affect the flow rate because pressure disturbances cannot travel upstream faster than the sonic velocity.

Upstream to the downstream pressure.

P2 is upstream.

The flow through a wellhead choke rarely consists of single-phase liquid, since the flowing tubing pressure is almost always below the bubble point. However, when this does occur, the flow rate is related to the pressure drop across the choke.

The flow coefficient for flow through nozzles is given in Figure 8-11 (Crane, 1957) as a function of the Reynolds number in the choke and the ratio of the choke diameter to the pipe diameter.

This equation applies for subcritical flow, which will usually be the case for single-phase liquid flow.

The choke diameter is often referred to as the “bean size” because the device in the choke that restricts the flow is called the bean.

Bean sizes are usually given in 64ths of an inch.

When the pressure ratio is less than the critical pressure ratio, p2/p1 should be set to (p2/p1)c.

Equations (8-69) and (8-70) apply when the pressure ratio is equal to or greater than the critical pressure ratio, given by.

Since the flow rate is insensitive to the downstream pressure whenever the flow is critical. For air and other diatomic gases, γ is approximately 1.4, and the critical pressure ratio is 0.53; in petroleum engineering operations, it is commonly assumed that flow through a choke is critical whenever the downstream pressure is less than about half of the upstream pressure.

When a well is being produced with critical flow through a choke, the relationship between the wellhead pressure and the flow rate is controlled by the choke, since downstream pressure disturbances (such as a change in separator pressure).

When a well is being produced with critical flow through a choke, the relationship between the wellhead pressure and the flow rate is controlled by the choke, since downstream pressure disturbances (such as a change in separator pressure) do not affect the flow performance through the choke. Thus, the attainable flow rate from a well for a given choke can be determined by matching the choke performance with the well performance, as determined by a combination of the well IPR and the vertical lift performance. The choke performance curve is a plot of the flowing tubing pressure versus the liquid flow rate, and can be obtained from the two-phase choke.

Thus, the attainable flow rate from a well for a given choke can be determined by matching the choke performance with the well performance, as determined by a combination of the well IPR and the vertical lift performance. The choke performance curve is a plot of the flowing tubing pressure versus the liquid flow rate, and can be obtained from the two-phase choke correlations, assuming that the flow is critical.

The Gilbert correlation predicts that the flowing tubing pressure is a linear function of the liquid flow rate, with an intercept at the origin.

The intersections of the choke performance curves with the well performance curve are the flow rates that would occur with these choke sizes. Note that the choke correlation is valid only when the flow through the choke is critical; for each choke, there will be a flow rate below which flow through the choke is subcritical. This region is indicated by the dashed portions of the choke performance curves—the predictions are not valid for these conditions.

P2 is downstream.

When flow is subcritical, the downstream pressure can influence the performance of the wells, and the flow through the entire piping network may have to be treated as a system.

When individual flow lines all join at a common point (Figure 8-14, left) the pressure at the common point is equal for all flow lines. The common point is typically a separator in an oil production system.

In a gathering system where individual wells are tied into a common pipeline, so that the pipeline flow rate is the sum of the upstream well flow rates as in Figure 8-14 (right), each well has a more direct effect on its neighbors. In this type of system, individual wellhead pressures can be calculated by starting at the separator and working upstream.

Rigorous method to calculate the actual wellbore pressure drop for a horizontal well with single-phase flow is to divide the well into a number of segments and use the average flow rate in the segment to compute the frictional.

A rigorous method to calculate the actual wellbore pressure drop for a horizontal well with single-phase flow is to divide the well into a number of segments and use the average flow rate in the segment to compute the frictional pressure drop in that segment.

Many nominally horizontal wells are not truly horizontal and slight variations in inclination can have profound effects on multiphase flow. Some “horizontal” wells are angled upward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-up” well); some are angled slightly downward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-down” well); and others may have both upward and downward inclined sections (an undulating well).

Many nominally horizontal wells are not truly horizontal and slight variations in inclination can have profound effects on multiphase flow. Some “horizontal” wells are angled upward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-up” well); some are angled slightly downward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-down” well); and others may have both upward and downward inclined sections (an undulating well). These trajectories are sometimes intentional for purposes such as augmenting artificial lift of liquids from gas wells. Other times, the final trajectory of the well being not perfectly horizontal is simply a result of the directional drilling process or because of a dip in the reservoir.

For upward flow (an upward inclination in the flow direction), liquid holdup will be higher than in a perfectly horizontal pipe because of the tendency for the liquid to fall back down the well.

It is also common in undulating well trajectories for the denser phase to accumulate in low spots (sumps) and the lighter phase to accumulate in the high spots (crests).

For a required wellhead flowing pressure, ptf, there exists a corresponding bottom hole flowing pressure, pwf, which is a function of the hydrostatic pressure difference and the frictional pressure losses in the tubing string.

Density differences and phase changes affect both the hydrostatic and the frictional pressure drops.

For two-phase flow an increase in the imposed wellhead pressure ordinarily would result in an even larger increase in the corresponding bottomhole pressure because gas will be redissolved, increasing the density of the fluid in the wellbore.

Thus, it is common to combine a single-phase oil or gas IPR with two-phase VFP.

Increasing the flowing gas–liquid ratio (GLR) would result in a reduction in the bottomhole pressure.

Increasing the flowing gas–liquid ratio (GLR) would result in a reduction in the bottomhole pressure. This is the purpose of gas lift. However, there exists a limiting GLR where the decrease in the hydrostatic pressure with be offset by the increase in the frictional pressure drop.

The IPR curve is shown in the pwf versus q plot.

The intersection of the two curves provides the expected production rate and the bottomhole flowing pressure.

For low-GLR fluids the hydrostatic pressure would comprise the overwhelming portion of the pressure gradient in the well. Therefore, the frictional pressure drop would be relatively small and, since it is the pressure component affected most by the flow rate, the associated VFP curve is likely to be flat.

For higher GLR values or for a gas well, the VFP curve is not expected to be linear. When two-phase gas–liquid flow is occurring in the tubing, there is usually a minimum pwf on the VFP curve. This minimum occurs because at low liquid flow rates, the liquid holdup, and hence the hydrostatic pressure drop, decreases with increasing flow rate.

The minimum occurs at the flow rate at which the increase in frictional pressure drop for rates above the minimum is greater than the decrease in hydrostatic pressure drop.

At this value of flow rate the change in the frictional pressure drop is equal in magnitude to the change in hydrostatic pressure drop.

Well deliverability is affected both by the well flow performance and the reservoir inflow.

Reduction in the bottomhole pressure, either by lowering the wellhead pressure (usually not feasible) or, especially, through artificial lift, would shift the VFP curve downward, resulting in the maintenance of the original production rate or retardation of its decline.

The main difference between single-phase and two-phase reservoirs is that the producing GLR in the latter will vary with time as the reservoir pressure declines. Gas coming out of solution in the reservoir will enter a growing gas cap, causing a free-flowing gas. This will be mixed in the well with the oil flow, which will also contain an amount of solution gas. As a result, the VFP curve will change with time and will shift downward. However, a new IPR at the lower reservoir pressure will be in effect. The composite effect is that while the well producing rate will decline, it will do so at a lower pace than the producing rate of single-phase reservoirs.

Approximate expressions can be obtained by substituting for the real-gas pseudo-pressures with the pressure-squared difference divided by the product of the average values of the viscosity and the gas deviation factor.

The vertical flow performance of a gas well consists of the hydrostatic and friction pressure drop components, just as for any other well.

Why is KE not significant.

When the VFP curve intersects a very steep portion of the IPR curve, like the 3 1/2 in. and 4 in. VFP curves, the production rate is insensitive to the tubing size.

In this case, to significantly increase the production rate, the well must be stimulated and the production rate is reservoir-limited. If, on the other hand, the VFP curves intersect a portion of the IPR that has a shallower slope, or the VFP curves themselves have a significant positive slope, as did the 2 3/8 in. and 2 7/8 in. VFP curves, changing the tubing conditions (or adding artificial lift) can significantly increase the production rate, while well stimulation will have less benefit. Such wells are referred to as tubing-limited. In general, a tubing-limited condition should be avoided if possible.

ΔpKE is the pressure drop resulting from a change in the velocity of the fluid between positions 1 and 2. It will be zero for an incompressible fluid unless the cross-sectional area of the pipe is different at the two positions of interest. From Equation (7-15),.

ΔpKE is the pressure drop resulting from a change in the velocity of the fluid between positions 1 and 2. It will be zero for an incompressible fluid unless the cross-sectional area of the pipe is different at the two positions of interest.

Combining Equations (7-24) and (7-26), the kinetic energy pressure drop due to a pipe diameter change for an incompressible fluid.

In the previous chapter the well inflow and vertical flow performances (IPR and VFP) were combined to provide the well deliverability.

The intersection of the plots of flow rate versus bottomhole flowing pressure of those two components of the reservoir and well system is the expected well deliverability.

Depends greatly on the type of flow regime controlling the well performance.

It depends greatly on the type of flow regime controlling the well performance.

Material balance calculations, relating underground withdrawal and reservoir pressure depletion, can provide the crucial pressure-time relationship. Therefore, the associated well deliverability would be the forecast of well production.

By definition, for steady-state flow, a single IPR curve would intersect the VFP curve. For pseudosteady-state flow the situation is more complicated because the average reservoir pressure will change with time. Given the values of the average reservoir pressure, , a family of IPR curves can be drawn, each intersecting the pwf axis at the individual reservoir pressures. What is needed is the element of time. Material balance calculations, relating underground withdrawal and reservoir pressure depletion, can provide the crucial pressure-time relationship. Therefore, the associated well deliverability would be the forecast of well production.

The well IPR can be calculated from the solution to the diffusivity equation.

In an infinite-acting reservoir, the well IPR can be calculated from the solution to the diffusivity equation.

Unless the wellhead pressure changes, there will be only one VFP curve for the well, and its intersections with the IPR curves will be the well production rate.

The fluid recovery from an undersaturated oil reservoir depends entirely on the fluid expansion as a result of underground withdrawal and associated pressure reduction.

Havlena and Odeh (1963, 1964) introduced the application of material balance to oil reservoirs that have initial oil-in-place N and a ratio m relating the initial hydrocarbon volume in the gas cap to the initial hydrocarbon volume in the oil zone.

For gas lift, gas is injected continuously or intermittently at selected location(s) along the production string, resulting in a reduction in density of the mixture in the tubing, and thus reducing the hydrostatic component of the pressure difference from the bottom to the top of the well. The purpose is to bring the fluids to the top at a desirable wellhead pressure, while keeping the bottomhole pressure at a value that is small enough to provide good driving force in the reservoir. This pressure drawdown must not violate restrictions for sand control and water or gas coning.

The liquid level in the annual isolates injected gas from the formation,.

Packers are used in the annulus, and a ball valve is used in the production tubing to prevent injected gas from flowing into the formation.

Both a single injection point and multiple injection points can be employed. First, a liquid slug must be built in the tubing above the bottom valve. Then, the valve opens, displacing the liquid slug upward. The valve remains open until the slug reaches the top, and then the valve closes. It reopens when a new liquid slug builds in the bottom of the well.

For multiple injection points, the bottom valve opens as described for the single-injection-point operation, but as the liquid slug moves upward, valves below the slug open. The valves close after the slug reaches the top. The actuation of the valves for intermittent gas lift can be done with a timing device or can depend on the pressure.

Preset pressure is provided by a pressure dome with a diaphragm, springs, or a combination of pressure dome and springs.

When casing or tubing pressure is higher than the preset pressure of the valves, the valve opens; otherwise, it remains closed.

Pressure differences are graphed against depth.

Δptrav is the pressure traverse and is a function of the flow rate, the GLR, the depth, and the properties and composition of the fluid.

For small values (< 100) or relatively large values (> 1500) of GLR, the gradient can usually be considered as largely constant for common well depths (≈ 10,000 ft). For intermediate values, dp/dz is not constant but, instead, is a function of depth.

Suppose that the natural GLR1 would result in a pressure traverse requiring an unacceptably large pwf. Then, for a more desirable pwf, injecting gas at a rate qg would lead to a higher GLR2. If the liquid rate is ql, then.

The gas added to the flow stream in the tubing in a gas-lifted well is injected down the casing-tubing annulus.

The pinj in the production tubing is an additional 100 to 150 psi less than the annulus pressure because of the pressure drop across the gas-lift valve.

The point of gas injection, Hinj, creates two zones in the well: one below, with an average flowing pressure gradient (dp/dz)b, and one above, with an average flowing pressure gradient (dp/dz)a. Thus,.

It should be obvious that the downhole gas injection pressure in the annulus, pinj,ann, must not be greater than the pressure within the tubing for gas to enter the tubing at the injection point.

Concept of continuous gas lift in terms of the pressure values, pressure gradients, well depth, and depth of injection.

The higher the required wellhead pressure, the lower the flowing gradient should be.

The position in the tubing where the downhole pressure of the injected gas is equal to the pressure in the tubing.

The actual point of injection is placed a few hundred feet higher to account for the pressure drop across the gas-lift valve, Δpvalve.

The calculated horsepower would be an important variable in gas-lift optimization design.

Most newly drilled wells are filled with kill fluids or completion fluids that have higher density than reservoir fluids.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading the kill fluid or completion fluid in the wellbore. The.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading the kill fluid or completion fluid in the wellbore. The fluid column can be hard to lift because of the high hydrostatic pressure.

The unloading procedure starts from the top-most valve. Gas injected through the first valve will lift the liquid column from the valve location to the surface, reducing the total hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. Then the first valve is closed, and the next valve below opens to lift the column from the second valve location upward. The procedure repeats until the entire wellbore is unloaded. The.

Very commonly, to start the procedure, a higher surface pressure at the annulus side is used, marked as kickoff pressure, pk,.

The pressure gradient inside the tubing is the wellbore fluid pressure gradient, which is much higher because of the denser fluid in the wellbore (in the figure, 0.4 psi/ft as an example).

The depth of the first valve is determined by the intercept of the two pressure gradient curves (annulus and tubing), which indicates that at the first valve location, the gas injected has high enough pressure to lift the liquid column.

Pth is the tubing head pressure, and gk and gg are the pressure gradients for kill fluid and injected gas.

The intercept of the tubing fluid gradient curve with the annulus gas pressure gradient curve defines the second valve’s location.

Notice that after the first column is lifted, a higher tubing head pressure is used in the calculation for the locations of the rest of the valves to provide a safety factor.

Once the well is unloaded, only the deepest operating valve is open for continuous gas-lift production.

Investigate the effect of increasing the gas injection rate, and therefore increasing the GLR in the wellbore. First, increasing the gas injection rate allows the injection at a lower point in the tubing without increasing the injection pressure.

Hinj increases [with the associated smaller (dp/dz)a] and since (dp/dz)b remains largely constant within a smaller interval H – Hinj, then pwf will necessarily decrease.

Hinj increases [with the associated smaller (dp/dz)a] and since (dp/dz)b remains largely constant within a smaller interval H – Hinj, then pwf will necessarily decrease. Therefore larger oil production rates are likely to be achieved with higher GLR and a lower injection point.

Similarly, to sustain a production rate while the reservoir pressure depletes, the flowing bottomhole pressure must be lowered. This can be accomplished by lowering the injection point and by increasing the gas injection rate. The initial operating valve may not be the deepest valve of the set, and the lower valve can be used in later life of the well production. This has a limit, addressed in the next section.

Limit value of GLR,.

Where the flowing pressure gradient is the minimum. For GLR values that are larger than the minimum,.

Where the flowing pressure gradient is the minimum. For GLR values that are larger than the minimum, the flowing gradient begins to increase.

While increasing the GLR from small values would result in a fluid density reduction with modest friction pressures, continued GLR increase would lead to a disproportionate increase in the friction pressure. Thus, the limit GLR is that value at which the increase in frictional pressure will offset the decrease in the hydrostatic pressure.

The limit GLR increases as the production rate decreases. Figure 11-9 is for a smaller liquid production rate (ql = 500 STB/d) in the same size well. In this example the limit GLR is approximately 7000 SCF/STB. This limit GLR for which the minimum pwf will be obtained is rarely the natural GLR of the reservoir fluids. Thus, it can be reached only through artificial gas lift.

A larger well size would lead to a larger limit GLR, with, of course, a larger gas injection rate.

The IPR curve, as always, characterizes the ability of the reservoir to deliver certain combinations of production rates and flowing bottomhole pressures.

For each liquid production rate there exists a limit GLR where the minimum pwf will be observed.

Intersecting this IPR curve is the optimum gas-lift performance curve of minimum flowing bottomhole pressures (minimum pressure intake curve), and for each production rate they correspond to the limit GLR.

Each gas-lift performance curve in the vicinity of the maximum production rate will result in a larger pressure intake and therefore lower production.

Maximum production rate is at the limit GLR.

Limit GLR corresponds to maximum ql.

The gas-lift GLR minus the natural GLR times the liquid production rate is the required gas injection rate as.

A plot of the gas injection rate versus the production rate is another gas-lift performance curve.

As the reservoir pressure declines, the driving force in the reservoir is reduced and therefore, in order to sustain a given production rate, the flowing bottomhole pressure must be reduced accordingly.

Sustaining a production rate would require an increase in the gas injection rate as the reservoir pressure declines.

Maximizing the liquid production rate with gas lift requires an increase in the gas injection rate, since the limit GLR is larger for smaller production rates in a given tubing size.

Downhole pumps are a common means of boosting the productivity of a well by lowering the bottomhole flowing pressure.

Downhole pumps increase the pressure at the bottom of the tubing a sufficient amount to lift the liquid stream to the surface.

The pressure gradient in the tubing is actually higher in a pumped well than it would be without the pump because most of the gas produced with the liquids is vented through the casing-tubing annulus.

Much of the free gas in the bottom of the well would be redissolved in oil at the higher pump outlet pressure, increasing the fluid density and gradient.

Positive-displacement pumps, which include sucker rod pumps and progressing cavity pumps (PCPs), and dynamic displacement pumps, the most common of which is the electrical submersible pump (ESP).

Plunger lift, commonly used to unload liquids from gas wells.

The work supplied by the pump is related to the increase in pressure across the pump by the mechanical energy balance equation, which for incompressible.

Ws is the work supplied by the pump, p2 is the pressure in the tubing just above the pump, p1 is the pressure just below the pump, and F is the frictional loss in the pump.

The pressures on either side of the pump are related to the bottomhole flowing pressure by the pressure gradient in the gas-liquid stream below the pump and to the surface pressure by the single-phase liquid gradient in the tubing.

From the surface tubing pressure, p2 is determined based on single-phase liquid flow at the desired rate.

The rotary motion of the crank is translated to a reciprocating motion of the polished rod by the Pitman and the walking beam; the sucker rods transmit the reciprocating motion from the polished rod to the down-hole pump.

Barrel with a ball-and-seat check valve at its bottom (the standing valve) and a plunger containing another ball-and-seat check valve (the traveling valve).

When the plunger moves up, the standing valve opens, the traveling valve closes, and the barrel fills with fluid.

On a down stroke, the traveling valve opens, the standing valve closes, and the fluid in the barrel is displaced into the tubing.

Positive-displacement pump performance is evaluated based on the volume of fluid displaced, not the pressure increase generated by the pump, since the compression of the wellbore fluid in the pump will create enough pressure to displace the fluid in the tubing.

Q is the downhole volumetric flow rate (bbl/d), N is the pump speed (strokes per minute, spm), Ev is the volumetric efficiency, Ap is the plunger cross-sectional area (in.2), and Sp is the effective plunger stroke length (in.).

The effective plunger stroke length will differ from and generally be less than the polished rod stroke length because of the stretching of the tubing and the rod string and because of overtravel caused by the acceleration of the rod string.

Ep is the plunger overtravel, et is the length the tubing is stretched, and er is the length the rod string is stretched.

Note that if the tubing is anchored, the tubing stretch will be zero.

The next step in designing a sucker rod pump installation is the determination of the power requirements for the prime mover.

The prime mover must supply sufficient power to provide the useful work needed to lift the fluid; to overcome frictional losses in the pump, the polished rod, and the rod string; and to allow for inefficiencies in the prime mover and the surface mechanical system. Thus the required prime mover power is.

Ph is the hydraulic horsepower needed to lift the fluid, Pf is the power dissipated as friction in the pump, and Fs is a safety factor accounting for primer mover inefficiency.

The hydraulic power is usually expressed in terms of net lift, LN,.

The net lift is the height to which the work provided by the pump alone can lift the produced fluid.

The net lift is the height to which the work provided by the pump alone can lift the produced fluid. If the tubing and casing pressure is zero at the surface and the liquid level in the annulus is at the pump, the net lift is simply the depth at which the pump is set.

The first one is for gear box rating; the second is for peak beam loading; and the last one for maximum stroke length.

The maximum load on the top sucker rod and on the beam of the pumping unit occurs during the upstroke when the rod weight, buoyed in the liquid, the liquid weight, and the upstroke dynamic loads are being lifted. Thus,.

The net gear box torque carried by the pumping unit is the difference between the torque created by the well load during the stroke and the offsetting counterbalance torque.

The performance characteristics of sucker rod pumps are commonly monitored by measuring the load on the polished rod with a dynamometer.

A recording of the polished rod load over one complete pump cycle is referred to as a “dynamometer card.” The dynamometer card plots polished rod load as a function of rod position.

An up-stroke begins and the polished rod load gradually increases as the rods stretch until at point b the polished rod supports the weight of the rods in the fluid and the weight of the fluid. The load remains constant.

The acceleration and deceleration of the rod string accounts for most of the difference between the ideal load history and the actual history of the polished rod in a properly operating rod-pumped well.

Notice the decreasing load on the upstroke and the loop in the curve at the end of the upstroke. A restriction in the well leads to an increasing load on the upstroke and little pump work, as indicated by the area of the region enclosed by the load curve.

Liquid pound occurs when the pump barrel does not fill completely on the upstroke and is characterized by a sudden decrease in load near the end of the downstroke.

Gas pound (Figure 12-6f) occurs when the pump partially fills with gas and exhibits a similar character to liquid pound, but the decrease in load is not as pronounced on the downstroke.

When the pump is almost completely filled with gas, gas lock has occurred, resulting in a dynamometer card like that in Figure 12-6g.

This card shows a decreasing load on the upstroke and little pump work. Finally, plunger undertravel and overtravel are indicated by cards like those in Figures 12-6h and 12-6i. With plunger undertravel, the load increases throughout the upstroke, whereas with overtravel, the load decreases throughout the upstroke.

When gas is present in the pump barrel, much of the pump energy is expended in compressing the gas instead of lifting the liquid.

When gas is present in the pump, on a downstroke, the gas must be compressed until the pressure in the barrel is equal to the pressure in the tubing above the pump before the traveling valve will open and allow fluid to pass into the tubing.

On an up-stroke, the gas must expand until the pressure is below p1, the pressure in the casing just below the pump, before the standing valve will open and.

On an up-stroke, the gas must expand until the pressure is below p1, the pressure in the casing just below the pump, before the standing valve will open and let wellbore fluids enter the barrel.

In extreme cases, essentially nothing will occur in the pump except the expansion and compression of gas; in this instance, the pump is said to be “gas-locked.”.

Free gas from entering a sucker rod pump. This is accomplished by setting the pump below the perforations so that the.

Some means must be employed to exclude most, if not all, of the free gas from entering a sucker rod pump. This is accomplished by setting the pump below the perforations so that the gas will rise out of the liquid stream moving to the pump or by employing various mechanical means to separate the gas from the liquid stream. Downhole devices installed on rod pumps to separate gas from the liquid are called “gas anchors.”.

Progressing cavity pump (PCP). This pump consists of a helically spiraling rotor that rotates inside of a doubly helical stator made of an elastomeric material.

The PCP geometry creates sealed cavities that progress from the pump inlet to the pump outlet as the rotor turns, thus displacing the fluid in the cavities.

A progressing cavity pump is commonly driven by a rotating rod string,.

Alternatively, a PCP can be driven by an electrical submersible motor, which makes a PCP practical in deviated and/or deep wells in which rod strings are impractical.

Progressing cavity pumps are better suited to handling fluids such as sand-laden or high-viscosity fluids than are rod pumps. For a thorough review of progressing cavity pumps,.

An electrical submersible pump (ESP) is a multistage centrifugal pump that offers a great deal of flexibility. ESPs are capable of producing very high volumes of liquid, can be used efficiently in deeper wells than sucker rod pumps, and are able to handle some free gas in the pumped fluid.

The motor is situated so that the produced fluids flow around the motor, providing cooling, either by setting the pump above the producing interval, or by equipping the pump with a shroud that directs the fluids past the motor before entering the pump intake.

Centrifugal pumps do not displace a fixed amount of liquid, as do positive-displacement pumps, but rather create a relatively constant amount of pressure increase to the flow stream.

The flow rate through the pump will thus vary, depending on the back pressure held on the system.

The pressure increase provided by a centrifugal pump is usually expressed as pumping head, the height of produced fluid that the Δp created by the pump can support:.

The pumping head is independent of the density of the fluid. For a multistage pump, the total head developed is equal to the sum of the pumping head from each stage,.

The pumping head of a centrifugal pump decreases as the volumetric throughput increases; however, the efficiency of the pump,.

As the reservoir pressure declines, the IPR curve will change, and hence the optimal pump design will gradually change. To design an ESP that will be optimal over a finite life span of the well involves a tradeoff between pumping requirements early in the life of the well and later in the life of the reservoir and is ultimately an economic question. Particularly in water-flooded reservoirs, where the water production rate may rise dramatically over the life span of the well, the pumping requirements may change drastically.

High fluid viscosity decreases the efficiency of a centrifugal pump and can affect the head developed. Pump manufacturers provide correction charts to.

High fluid viscosity decreases the efficiency of a centrifugal pump and can affect the head developed.

If the gas velocity in the tubing string is not sufficient to lift the liquids to the surface, liquid accumulates in the well, increasing the bottomhole pressure.

In relatively low-rate gas wells, the liquid accumulation can severely restrict the gas production rate, or may in fact kill the well (prevent flow).

The same pumps used in oil-producing wells, such as rod pumps or electrical submersible pumps, can be used to pump liquid from a gas well.

An alternative lifting method that is relatively inexpensive and requires no energy input is plunger lift. Plunger lift is a cyclical, intermittent lift method that uses the energy of the reservoir to lift the accumulated liquid from the tubing string.

The plunger is a hollow tube that fits snugly in the tubing string.

This chapter provides a brief overview of ways to quantify parameters essential to well performance evaluation and well completion or workover design.

Once the well has been cased and completed, cased hole logs provide mechanisms to evaluate cement, saturation changes, or fluid movement behind the casing and to locate fluid entries along the well.

Transient well analysis includes traditional pressure transient analysis and production data analysis.

Quantification of permeability and skin generally requires analysis of transient data.

The key to transient analysis is to understand how to recognize key streamline flow geometries, known as flow regimes, from their characteristic trends in the transient data. The flow regime overview provided in this chapter emphasizes the use of the log–log diagnostic plot for flow regime identification and estimation of parameters that are important to production engineering applications.

The final section of this chapter addresses diagnostic fracture injection tests as a means to determine permeability in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs with permeability that is so low that conventional methods fail.

Gamma ray log position clearly indicates the shaley intervals.

Furthermore, the photoelectric (PE) log is highest in limestone, second highest in shale, still lower in dolomite, and lowest in sandstone.

Wireline tools can also be used to perform a microfrac test that can provide the fracture initiation pressure.

As well, sonic and dipole sonic logs can provide estimates for rock mechanics properties versus depth, including Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Lithology changes identified from the gamma ray log, especially from sandstone or carbonate to shale, help to estimate hydraulic fracture height.

For example, clay minerals can be analyzed that are needed for matrix acid design.

Relationship between porosity and permeability and, in the case of carbonates, the acid penetration versus rate and volume injected. These variables are used in the design of acidizing treatments and the simulation of their effectiveness.

Differential strain curve analysis.

Such measurements point toward hydraulic fracture orientation and azimuth and, implicitly, the direction of reservoir permeability anisotropy, maximum permeability is generally in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, minimum permeability in the direction of minimum stress.

Pressure transient tests also provide a mechanism to quantify post completion, stimulation, and workover properties that cannot be determined from open-hole logs.

Cased hole logs include both static logs acquired while the well is shut in and production logs designed to measure properties of fluids as they are flowing through the wellbore.

Drilling and workover operations are often highly sensitive to the quality of the seal provided by the cement between the well casing and the formation.

Cement evaluation tool.

Combination of three log tracks on the left, combines gamma ray, caliper, fluid transit time, and relative bearing in the first track with minimum and maximum compressive strength and an angular average of acoustic impedance in the second track, and the circumferential bond image in the third track to the left of a track showing gas flags and reflection flags.

White spaces occur in this image when the cement bond is lacking and coincide with lower compressive strengths and higher incidence of gas and reflection flags.

Based on measurement of the time and amplitude of acoustic signals that travel through casing, cement, and formation rock in various annular paths along the borehole.

The CBT includes an average sonic transit time log in the first track, average amplitude in the middle track, and variable density imaged in the right-most track.

In particular, the right-most track shows percentages of solid cement (black), liquid mud (white), gas, (dotted area), and gas cut cement (gray).

For example, a series of cased hole logs can track changes in saturation near the wellbore that can be used to identify hydrocarbons that have been bypassed by injected water or gas or to characterize changes in fluid contact levels due to gas cap or water encroachment.

Production logging as an aid in diagnosing the case of poor well performance.

Productivity. For example, if a well has begun to produce an excessive water cut compared with neighboring.

Indicate remedial action to be taken to improve well productivity.

If a well has begun to produce an excessive water cut compared with neighboring wells, the increased water rate may be due to channeling from another zone behind pipe, water coning, or premature breakthrough in a high-permeability zone.

By running a suite of production logs that can locate channeling and measure the profile of water entry into the well, the engineer may be able to distinguish among these causes and, more important, properly plan a corrective workover, such as a cement squeeze treatment. Another commonly occurring problem is less than expected production based on normal decline. This may be the result of damage in one of the layers in a co-mingled production. It becomes essential to identify the problematic.

Supplement to the information gained from the well flow rate and pressure history and other well tests.

The engineer using production logging should always be mindful of the uncertainty that sometimes exists in these interpreted log results.

Lower-than-expected reservoir kh, low relative permeability to the hydrocarbon phase, formation damage, poorly penetrating or plugged perforations (or other restrictions in the completion, such as a partially plugged gravel pack), and wellbore restrictions.

Pressure transient test to measure the reservoir kh and skin factor, as described later in this chapter.

If the reservoir itself has been ruled out as the cause of low productivity, production logging can now be used to define more clearly the location and vertical extent of productivity impairment.

Channeling between the casing and the formation caused by poor cement conditions.

Is sometimes the cause of high water or gas production rates.

Measuring the mechanical properties of the cement behind the casing. To positively identify channeling, a production log that can respond to flow behind the casing is needed. Among the logs that can serve this purpose are temperature, radioactive tracer, and noise logs.

The temperature log exhibits cool anomalies caused by Joule-Thomson cooling at gas expansion locations, while the noise log measure increased noise amplitude at the same locations. Thus both logs respond to gas flow at the gas source, at a restriction in the channel behind the casing, and at the location of gas entry into the wellbore. Figure 13-7.

The temperature log exhibits cool anomalies caused by Joule-Thomson cooling at gas expansion locations, while the noise log measure increased noise amplitude at the same locations. Thus both logs respond to gas flow at the gas source, at a restriction in the channel behind the casing, and at the location of gas entry into the wellbore.

To eliminate the excessive gas production, a cement squeeze can be performed to block the flow in the channel. This can best be accomplished by perforating near the gas source and circulating cement through the channel.

Preferential flow of water or gas through high-permeability layers.

A common cause of high gas or water production in oil wells. Unwanted gas or water entries of this nature can sometimes be located with production logs.

Excessive water production may result from injected water in a waterflood or from water encroaching from an aquifer. An accurate flow profile of the production well can identify the location of the high-permeability zone or zones contributing to the high production rate. However, the location of the water entry is not generally sufficient information to identify the case of water production as being flow through a thief zone. Particularly if the water entry location is at the bottom of the completed interval, the water source may be channeling or coning from lower zones. Additional logs or tests are needed to distinguish among these possibilities.

Because the measurement and interpretation of the logs in the multiphase flow in production wells are generally less accurate (and more expensive) than those in a single-phase flow, in waterflood operations, water distribution in a reservoir is often monitored by measuring injection well profiles and assuming continuity of the reservoir layers between injectors and producers.

A prudent approach would be to first run temperature and fluid density logs. Both of these logs should locate the gas entry or entries qualitatively; in addition, the temperature log will help differentiate between production from a thief zone and gas production resulting from channeling.

From the cool anomaly on the temperature log and the decrease in fluid density, zone B is identified as the thief zone.

Gas coning results when a well is completed near a gas/oil contact and sufficient vertical permeability exists for gas to migrate downward to the wellbore as the pressure is drawn down around the well.

Distinguishing between coning and flow through a high-permeability layer will be difficult with production logs alone.

The most conclusive test for coning would be to produce the well at several different flow rates or drawdowns, as coning is inherently a rate-sensitive phenomenon.

Whether it is necessary to positively identify coning versus flow through a high-permeability layer depends on the actions being considered to correct the excessive gas or water production. If, in either case, the perforations producing the gas or water will be squeeze cemented or plugged back, it may not be important to determine with certainty if coning is occurring. However, future reservoir management practices could likely be improved by a clear knowledge of the mechanism of excessive gas or water production.

Problem with this particular well (channeling or coning) or is due to a surplus of injection water in the lower part of the reservoir.

Evidence of channeling or coning.

Temperature log, in particular, may indicate if flow is occurring from below the perforations.

If the pattern of water injection in one or more injection wells shows high water rates into the lowest zone, preferential flow through a high-permeability layer is the likely cause of the high water production.

The total rate from the production well could be lowered—if a rate is found where water production ceased, coning has been identified as the cause of excessive water production.

Production logging can provide useful information for the planning of well workovers, primarily by providing information about the distribution of flow of the various phases into the well.

Among the workovers that can benefit from post-treatment production logging are remedial cementing, reperforating, acidizing, fracturing, and water shutoff or profile modification treatments.

In a low-productivity well that is being reperforated, comparison of the flow profile before and after perforating should indicate the productivity of the reperforated intervals directly.

Because the injected fracturing fluid is generally significantly cooler than the formation being fractured at typical injection rates, the fracture fluid temperature where it exits the wellbore will be near the surface temperature.

As the treatment proceeds, the unfractured formation around the wellbore is cooled by radial heat conduction, as in any injection well, while cool fluid is placed in the fracture.

Because the radial heat transfer in the unfractured region is more rapid than the linear heat conduction in the fracture, the fractured region will warm more slowly, yielding a cool anomaly on a temperature log. Thus the fracture height can be identified by the location.

Because the radial heat transfer in the unfractured region is more rapid than the linear heat conduction in the fracture, the fractured region will warm more slowly, yielding a cool anomaly on a temperature log. Thus the fracture height can be identified by the location of a cool anomaly on a temperature log run after a brief (a few hours) shut-in period after fracturing.

Warm anomalies often appear in the region that may have been fractured; these may be due to variations in the formation thermal diffusivity, frictional heating of the fracturing fluid as it is injected at a high rate through perforations or in the fracture, from the fluid movement within the fracture after shut-in (Dobkins, 1981), or deviation of the fracture plan from intersection with the wellbore.

The vertical extent of the fracture is indicated by the region where the two logs diverge,.

When a warm anomaly appears on a post-fracture temperature log and no corresponding anomaly exists on the prefracture log, the warm anomaly is apparently caused by fluid movement in the fracture after shut-in derivation of the fracture from intersection with the wellbore.

When a warm anomaly appears on a post-fracture temperature log and no corresponding anomaly exists on the prefracture log, the warm anomaly is apparently caused by fluid movement in the fracture after shut-in derivation of the fracture from intersection with the wellbore. The warm-anomaly region would then be included as part of the interpreted fractured zone.

A measure of propped fracture height can be obtained by radioactively tagging the final portion of the proppant, then running a postfracture γ-ray log to locate the tagged proppant.

As with the temperature log, this method fails if the fracture plane is not coincident with the wellbore for the entire height of the fracture.

Among the problems that may arise are abnormally low or high injectivity, abnormal pressure or fluid level in the annulus, and low productivity or high water production in offset producers.

By measuring the amount of flow to each reservoir interval, or by checking for interval isolation, by finding leaks in the well equipment.

The fundamental information sought with a production log in an injection well is the flow profile, the amount of fluid being injected into each interval.

Flow profiles are measured in injection wells with temperature, radioactive tracer, and spinning flowmeter logs.

A change in rate and/or wellhead pressure often indicates a serious well or reservoir problem.

Abnormally low injectivity or a marked drop in injection rate can result from formation damage around the wellbore, plugged perforations, restrictions in the casing or tubing, or scaling.

Techniques that combine production logging with transient testing, such as the production log test, selective inflow performance, and the multilayer transient test provide the most complete information about abnormally high or low injectivity.

Logs obtained occasionally through the life of the well would show this as being a natural progression in a waterflood. Without knowledge of this gradual change, a profile obtained several years after the start of injection might appear sufficiently different from the initial profile to lead to an erroneous conclusion that channeling had developed or that some other drastic change had taken place.

The most likely causes of the high injection rate are leaks in the tubing, casing, or packer, or channeling to another zone. Fracturing is not a likely cause because the similarly completed surrounding injectors have the same wellhead pressure, yet do not exhibit abnormally high rate. Another unlikely, but possible, cause is that all the surrounding injection wells are damaged to similar extents, while the high-rate well is relatively undamaged.

A combination of a temperature and a noise log would be a good choice to attempt to locate the suspected leak or channel.

The small increase in noise amplitude at about 9140 ft could be due to flow through a restriction in a channel or flow through a casing leak.

The first subsection briefly describes rate transient analysis primarily for estimation of the well expected ultimate recovery (EUR).

Pressure and rate transient analysis based on geometric flow regimes that enable estimation of key parameters of interest to production engineering including the formation pore pressure, horizontal and vertical permeability values, damage skin, hydraulic fracture conductivity and half-length, and the well drainage pore volume.

There are only five flow regimes critical to production engineering: radial, spherical, linear, bilinear, and compression/expansion flow.

Describes analysis of flow regimes found in fracture calibration tests that enable estimation of reservoir permeability along with the minimum stress, fluid leakoff coefficient, and fluid efficiency needed for hydraulic fracture treatment design.

The rate function can be integrated over time to determine the cumulative production up until the time the well reaches the economic limit rate. The resulting cumulative production is called the expected ultimate recovery, or the EUR.

In reality exponential decline is the expected rate behavior for single-phase production from a well that is produced with a constant bottomhole pressure once the well has reached pseudosteady state flow. Since constant bottomhole pressure is a common production condition, exponential decline is frequently observed in conventional oil and gas wells. Harmonic and hyperbolic decline behaviors seem to be associated with flow below bubble or dew point pressure.

We must consider the impact of the well completion on the behavior of the rate decline before the onset of pseudosteady state. Generally, the rate will decline faster in stimulated wells, but it will start from a higher initial rate.

The formation test (Moran and Finklea, 1962) is not a well test.

The wireline formation test is typically performed in a mud-filled open hole. Hydraulically operated arms press against one side of the borehole, forcing the testing device against the opposing side. A doughnut-shaped rubber packer provides a seal, inside which a probe is forced into the formation. When exposed to low pressure, reservoir fluids flow into the tool. When a valve is shut, flow stops and a buildup occurs. Because the flow is only for a few seconds or minutes, the pressure builds up to the reservoir pressure in a short period of time. The test radius of investigation is at most only a few feet, but unlike in most well tests, the pressure disturbance expands spherically, not radially.

The test radius of investigation is at most only a few feet, but unlike in most well tests, the pressure disturbance expands spherically, not radially. This test is repeated at successive locations, providing a measure of reservoir pressure versus depth.

Conducted on a newly drilled well, the pressure measurements represent the static pressure profile with depth for the area in hydraulic communication with the well horizontally.

This option, which is analogous to a mini drill stem test, extends the test radius of investigation, thus enabling determination of more representative permeability values.

One application for this option is determination of the formation minimum stress by creating a microfracture.

Such measurements are very useful in predicting hydraulic fracture height migration and containment.

The formation test tool also includes a device that senses the phase of fluids withdrawn from the reservoir so that representative samples of reservoir fluids can be obtained, and multiple chambers are available that permit collection of pressurized downhole fluid samples at more than one depth in a logging trip. Formation fluid properties can sometimes be determined at the wellsite, and samples can also be sent to a PVT laboratory for more rigorous analysis.

Formation pressure measurements may show clearer indications of vertical and/or areal barriers in wells drilled after the field is put on production and differential depletion effects have become evident in the pressure data.

The high conductivity interval is produced with less pressure drop in the wellbore than in the other(s), which remain at a much higher pressure. Whenever.

The high conductivity interval is produced with less pressure drop in the wellbore than in the other(s), which remain at a much higher pressure. Whenever a well with differential depletion among commingled units is shut in, fluids flow from the higher-pressure intervals into the more depleted zones, resulting in wellbore crossflow, also called backflow.

Permeability and pressure determination combined with downhole fluid sampling have enabled wireline testing to achieve functions that were once only performed by drill stem tests.

When a production well is shut in, the downhole pressure builds up, as seen in Figure 13-20. Pressure buildup data can be acquired any time flow from the well is stopped, whether for the purpose of a test or for other operational reasons, provided there is a pressure guage available to sense time-dependent pressure changes and either transmit the pressure measurements in real time or record them in memory for later retrieval.

Neither permeability nor skin can be quantified from the productivity index determined from a stabilized flow test unless the other is known from some other measurement.

Most pressure transient data are interpreted when the well is not flowing as either a pressure buildup in a producing well or a pressure falloff in an injection well.

In the log–log diagnostic plot, the upper curve is pressure change, and the lower curve is the pressure change derivative.

When the well is hydraulically fractured or horizontal, the pressure penetrates from the extended wellbore, which itself may extend several thousand feet.

Two common production data analysis methods that can be used to estimate well and reservoir parameters are rate-normalized pressure (reciprocal productivity index) and pressure-normalized rate (productivity index).

The rate used for qref to keep the RNP in pressure units is a matter of convention.

RNP is interpreted as a virtual drawdown at constant rate.

The integral of RNP (IRNP) is computed as.

The advantage of production data is that it is collected for a much longer time than pressure buildup data, which is only available whenever the well is shut.

The flow geometries are called flow regimes.

When pressure behavior is dominated by a particular flow regime, it is possible to compute permeability in the direction of flow and dimensions of flow geometry.

The radial flow regime is the most strategic of all the flow regimes because it enables estimation of the permeability parallel to the bedding plane.

Permeability is actually directionally dependent, and the permeability value in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is often significantly less than the permeability parallel to the bedding plane.

The term reservoir permeability is the permeability value in the direction parallel to the bedding plane, and this is often called horizontal permeability even though the bedding plane may be dipping. Likewise,.

The term reservoir permeability is the permeability value in the direction parallel to the bedding plane, and this is often called horizontal permeability even though the bedding plane may be dipping. Likewise, the permeability value for the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is called vertical permeability. When there is significant variation in permeability for different directions, this is called permeability anisotropy.

Wellbore storage, so called because in early time most pressure transient tests show behavior dominated by expansion and/or redistribution of wellbore fluids. At the beginning of the wellbore storage transient, both pressure and derivative may be overlain in a straight trend with unit slope.

For pressure buildup during this time the sandface rate changes from the flow rate before the buildup to zero.

After the sandface rate is zero, the observed pressure change and derivative are dominated by pressure transient behavior in the reservoir.

Wellbore storage behavior can be complex and may exhibit changing wellbore storage due to redistribution of wellbore fluid phases. For oil wells, as gas bubbles migrate upward in the wellbore, the average compressibility of the wellbore fluids increases, causing an increasing effective wellbore storage coefficient. In gas wells, gas condensate droplets dropping in the well-bore cause a decrease in the effective wellbore storage coefficient. It is very important to be able to distinguish wellbore storage transients from reservoir behavior.

Matching pressure transient data with a global model accounting for all parameters provides more accurate parameter estimates than analysis by individual flow regimes. Typically the global model is found using a least-square regression calculation such as would be provided in commercial software for pressure transient test analysis. However, more often than not flow regime estimates are quite close and serve as good starting values for the least-square regression calculation.

This condition is often intentional, or it can occur unintentionally when severe formation or perforation damage prevents flow to the well along a portion of the productive interval.

This condition is often intentional, or it can occur unintentionally when severe formation or perforation damage prevents flow to the well along a portion of the productive interval. Limited entry is called partial completion when only a portion of the cased and cemented completion is perforated.

As more and more wells install permanent downhole pressure gauges, buildup tests are becoming increasingly common.

Knowing how to estimate parameters from the log–log diagnostic plot is a skill worth mastering.

The flow regime is named pseudolinear because true linear flow occurs only when the flow streamlines are strictly normal to a planar source, and this only occurs when the vertical fracture half-length is equal to the width of the well drainage area.

Pseudoradial flow appears only when the effective wellbore radius is less than 1/10 of the well effective drainage radius.

After sufficient time on production, the well will reach either steady-state or pseudosteady-state flow.

For unconventional reservoirs with very low permeability, the time to reach pseudoradial, pseudo-steady, or steady-state flow may be very long.

If the well spacing is not sufficiently small, the well may remain in the fractured dominated pseudolinear or bilinear flow regime for its entire life.

In low-permeability formations, it is often impossible to determine permeability from a conventional pretreatment buildup test because flow to the well cannot occur without hydraulic fracture stimulation.

The examples in the previous section show how challenging it can be to determine permeability after the hydraulic fracture treatment and how long it can take to determine permeability from production data.

The fracture calibration injection falloff test, commercially called a mini-frac or a diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT), offers a way to estimate the formation permeability and pressure before the main hydraulic fracture treatment, even in very low-permeability formations.

Injecting the fracture fluid intended for the main fracture treatment at a pressure high enough to open a fracture in the formation creates an unpropped fracture. When injection stops, the unpropped fracture closes. The transient pressure behavior observed in the pressure falloff after the end of the injection enables quantification of the following three parameters: • Formation closure stress, which corresponds to an average value along the lithological profile of the minimum principle in-situ stress • Fracture fluid leakoff coefficient, CL • Fracture fluid efficiency, η Chapter 17 indicates how these parameters.

These parameters are determined from the pressure falloff behavior observed up until the created fracture closes. If the pressure falloff is allowed to continue long enough after the fracture closure is observed, it is possible also to determine the formation permeability and pressure. Analysis of the falloff behavior observed after the fracture closes is called after-closure analysis (ACA).

Injection of the same type of fluid to be used for the main treatment pressurizes the formation until the rock breakdown is achieved.

Injection of the same type of fluid to be used for the main treatment pressurizes the formation until the rock breakdown is achieved. After breakdown the fracture propagates until the pumps are shut down. At this point the pressure falls off. An instantaneous decrease in pressure to the value labeled as ISIP (instantaneous shut-in pressure) is due to friction losses. The instantaneous pressure drop is generally quite large if pressure is recorded at the wellhead, but when bottomhole pressure is recorded, the instantaneous pressure drop is mainly due to pressure losses in the near wellbore area.

Since during propagation the pressure gradient inside the fracture is negligible, the propagated fracture has effectively infinite conductivity.

While they are not estimated from standard pressure transient analysis, the closure stress, leakoff coefficient, and fracture fluid efficiency are critical inputs for main treatment hydraulic fracture design.

Matrix acidizing is a well stimulation technique in which an acid solution is injected into the formation in order to dissolve some of the minerals present, and hence recover or increase the permeability in the near-wellbore vicinity.

The most common acids used are hydrochloric acid (HCl), used primarily to dissolve carbonate minerals, and mixtures of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids (HF/HCl), for attacking silicate minerals such as clays and feldspars. Because traditional drilling fluid (drilling “mud”) was a suspension of bentonite clay, the mixture HF/HCl, effective in dissolving bentonite particles, has been known in the vernacular as mud acid.

The most common acids used are hydrochloric acid (HCl), used primarily to dissolve carbonate minerals, and mixtures of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids (HF/HCl), for attacking silicate minerals such as clays and feldspars.

Matrix acidizing is a near-wellbore treatment, with all of the acid reacting within about a foot of the wellbore in sandstone formations, and within a few to perhaps as much as 10–20 ft of the wellbore in carbonates.

An acidizing treatment is called a “matrix” treatment because the acid is injected at pressures below the parting pressure of the formation, so that fractures are not created. The objective is to greatly enhance or recover the permeability very near the wellbore, rather than affect a large portion of the reservoir.

Acid fracturing, resulting from the injection of fluids at pressure above the fracturing pressure of the formation, is intended to create a path of high conductivity by dissolving the walls of the fracture in a nonuniform way. Therefore, for the petroleum production engineer, acid fracturing has more in common with proppant fracturing than with matrix acidizing. Acid fracturing is sometimes used to overcome formation damage in relatively high-permeability formations. However, carbonate reservoirs of relatively low permeability may also be candidates for acid fracturing. For such reservoirs, a comparison with propped fracturing must be done, taking into account the expected post-treatment production rate versus costs.

In sandstone reservoirs, matrix acidizing should generally be applied only when a well has a high skin effect that cannot be attributed to partial penetration, perforation efficiency, or other mechanical aspects of the completion.

This 1-ft acid penetration distance is typical of what occurs in sandstone acidizing.

This example illustrates that matrix acidizing is primarily beneficial in removing damage when the depth of live acid penetration is shallow. For lower-permeability sandstone reservoirs, significant simulation of undamaged wells is generally possible only with hydraulic fracturing. Acid can penetrate deep enough in carbonate reservoirs to make matrix stimulation of these reservoirs beneficial, even with no damage present.

Stoichiometry The amount of acid needed to dissolve a given amount of mineral is determined by the stoichiometry of.

The amount of acid needed to dissolve a given amount of mineral is determined by the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction, which describes the number of moles of each species involved in the reaction.

A complication is that the fluosilicates may exist in various forms (Bryant, 1991), so that the total amount of HF required to dissolve a given amount of quartz depends on the solution concentration.

For the reactions between HF and feldspars, for example, the primary reactions predict that 14 moles of HF are needed to consume one mole of feldspar.

If only the primary reaction occurs, 32 moles of HF are consumed in dissolving one mole of kaolinite. However, if the secondary reaction proceeds to completion, the net consumption of HF per mole of kaolinite is only 20/3 because the fluosilicic acid produced in the primary reaction would consume two more moles of kaolinite and also produce 12 moles of HF.

A more convenient way to express reaction stoichiometry is with the dissolving power,.

The dissolving power expresses the amount of mineral that can be consumed by a given amount of acid on a mass or volume basis. First, the gravimetric dissolving power, β, the mass of mineral consumed by a given mass of acid, is defined as.

The dissolving power of any other concentration of acid is the β100 times the weight fraction of acid in the acid solution. For the commonly used 15 wt%.

The volumetric dissolving power, χ, similarly defined as the volume of mineral dissolved by a given volume of acid solution, is related to the gravimetric dissolving power by.

These dissolving powers assume complete reaction between the acid and the dissolving mineral species. However, the reactions of weak acids with carbonate minerals is often limited by the equilibrium between the reactants and the reaction products.

This equilibrium limitation decreases the dissolving power of weak acids.

Acid–mineral reactions are termed “heterogeneous” reactions because they are reactions between species occurring at the interface between different phases, the aqueous phase acid and the solid mineral.

The overall rate of acid consumption or mineral dissolution will depend on two distinct phenomena: the rate of transport of acid to the mineral surface by diffusion or convection, and the actual reaction rate on the mineral surface.

Surface reaction rates (reaction kinetics) are discussed in this section, while acid transport is detailed.

On the other hand, the surface reaction rates for many HF–mineral reactions are very slow compared with the acid transport rate, and the overall rate of acid consumption or mineral dissolution is reaction rate controlled.

For example, the reaction rate for the HCl-CaCO3 reaction is extremely high, so the overall rate of this reaction is usually controlled by the rate of acid transport to the surface, the slower of the two processes.

A reaction rate is generally defined as the rate of appearance in the solution of the species of interest in units of moles per second. A surface reaction rate depends on the amount of surface exposed to reaction, so these reactions are expressed on a per-unit surface area basis.

RA is the rate of appearance of A (moles/sec), rA is the surface area–specific reaction rate of A (moles/sec-m2), and SB is the surface area of mineral B. When A is being consumed, the reaction rates, rA and RA, are negative.

In order to measure the surface reaction rate of acid–mineral reactions, it is necessary to maintain a constant mineral surface area or measure its change during reaction, and to ensure that the rate of acid transport to the mineral surface is fast relative to the reaction rate.

Well-stirred slurry of mineral particles suspended in an acid solution (a stirred reactor) and with a rotating-disk apparatus.

In the rotating-disk apparatus, a disk of the mineral is placed in a large container holding the acid solution. The disk is rotated rapidly, so that the acid mass transfer rate is high relative to the surface reaction rate.

A third, more indirect method is by matching the core flood response to acidizing with a model of the process of flow with reaction. This.

For the feldspar reactions, the reaction rate increases with increasing HCl concentration, even though HCl is not consumed in the reaction.

Hr. Since feldspar is one of the faster-reacting constituents of sandstone, this indicates that the reaction rates in sandstone acidizing are quite small.

When the surface reaction rate is high, the overall rate of consumption of acid and dissolution of minerals will be controlled by the rate of acid transport to the mineral surfaces.

Acid is transported to the mineral surface by diffusion and by convection. The diffusional flux of acid is given by Fick’s law,.

A major concern in acidizing, particularly acidizing of sandstones, is damage caused by the precipitation of acid–mineral reaction products.

The most common damaging precipitates that may form in sandstone acidizing are calcium fluoride, CaF2; colloidal silica, Si(OH)4; ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)3; and asphaltene sludges.

However, laboratory core floods suggest that the precipitation is not instantaneous and in fact may occur at a fairly slow rate (Shaughnessy and Kunze, 1981). To minimize the damage caused by colloidal silica, it is probably advantageous to inject at relatively high rates, so that the potential precipitation zone is rapidly displaced away from the wellbore. Also, spent acid should be produced back immediately after the completion of injection, since shutting in the well for even a relatively short time may allow significant silica precipitation to occur in the near-well vicinity.

Finally, in some reservoirs, contacting the crude oil by acid can cause the formation of asphaltenic sludges. Simple bottle tests in which a sample of crude oil is mixed with the acid can indicate whether the crude has a tendency for sludge formation when contacted by acid. When sludge formation is a problem, emulsions of acid in aromatic solvents or surface-active additives have been used to prevent asphaltene precipitation.

The first step in the planning of any matrix acidizing treatment for a sandstone formation should be a careful analysis of the cause(s) of impaired well performance.

This analysis should begin with the measurement of the well skin effect.

For highly deviated wells, there is a negative skin effect contribution from the extra exposure to the reservoir.

When a large positive skin effect is present, sources of mechanical skin (partial penetration, perforation skin, etc.) should be investigated,.

If mechanical effects do not explain the flow impairment, formation damage is indicated.

In general, damage due to drilling mud invasion or fines migration can be successfully treated with acid.

Typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products.

Typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products. A sandstone acidizing treatment design begins with the selection of the type and concentration of acid.

Once acid-treatable formation damage has been identified as the cause of poor well productivity, acidizing treatment design can begin. A typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products.

A sandstone acidizing treatment design begins with the selection of the type and concentration of acid to be used. The volume of preflush, HF/HCl mixture, and post-flush required, and the desired injection rate(s), are considered next. In virtually all acid treatments, the placement of the acid is an important issue—a strategy to ensure that sufficient volumes of acid contact all productive parts of the formation should be carefully planned.

The type and strength (concentration) of acid used in sandstones or carbonates is selected based primarily on field experience with particular formations.

For years, the standard treatments consisted of 15 wt% HCl for carbonate formations and a 3 wt% HF, 12 wt% HCl mixture, preceded by a 15 wt% HCl preflush, for sandstones.

The benefits of lower-concentration HF solutions are the reduction in damaging precipitates from the spent acid and lessened risk of unconsolidation of the formation around the well-bore.

These curves show that a lower-strength HF solution yields less damage in the early stages of injection; a conservative treatment design would select this low concentration as the best choice of those tested.

The obvious goal of a sandstone acidizing treatment is to remove near-wellbore formation damage. A less obvious but equally important goal is to minimize the damage caused by the acidizing process itself.

Such a slow rate may allow precipitates to form from the spent acid very near the perforations, reducing the overall effectiveness of the acid. Thus, what may be an optimal rate based only on the dissolution of minerals in the damaged zone may be less than optimum when the overall acidizing process is considered.

The volume of acid that is needed depends strongly on the depth of the damaged zone, and this depth is seldom known with any accuracy. With an assumption being made about the depth of the damaged zone, an optimal volume for a particular location in the well may be selected based on a laboratory acid response curve or an acidizing model.

To ensure that an adequate amount of acid contacts most of the formation, a larger amount of acid may be necessary, depending mainly on the techniques used for proper acid placement.

A very common application of acidizing in sandstones is to remove the damage caused by the invasion of drilling mud into the formation. When damage is caused by the invasion of HF-soluble solids like bentonite clay, an acidizing treatment is a very effective method of increasing well productivity if the damage is not too deep. The amount of acid needed depends strongly on the depth of the bentonite damage.

The simplest extension of the two-mineral model is to include the reaction of fluosilicic acid with the lumped fast-reacting minerals, which also requires explicit consideration of the precipitation.

Possible damaging precipitates. The two-acid, three-mineral model suggests that using the two-mineral model for predicting required acid volumes will be a conservative approach, particularly.

The two-acid, three-mineral model considers the precipitation of silica gel in its description of the acidizing process. However, there are other reaction products that may precipitate. The tendency for reaction product precipitation has been studied with comprehensive geochemical models that consider a large number of possible reactions that may take place in sandstone acidizing.

The permeability increases as pores and pore throats are enlarged by mineral dissolution. At the same time, small particles are released as cementing material is dissolved, and some of these particles will lodge (perhaps temporarily) in pore throats, reducing the permeability. Any precipitates formed will also tend to decrease.

The permeability increases as pores and pore throats are enlarged by mineral dissolution. At the same time, small particles are released as cementing material is dissolved, and some of these particles will lodge (perhaps temporarily) in pore throats, reducing the permeability. Any precipitates formed will also tend to decrease the permeability. The formation of CO2 as carbonate minerals are dissolved may also cause a temporary reduction in the relative permeability to liquids. The result of these competing effects is that the permeability in core floods usually decreases initially; with continued acid injection, the permeability eventually increases to values considerably higher than the original permeability.

Results with the two-acid, three-mineral model have shown that acidizing efficiency is relatively insensitive to injection rate, and that the highest rate possible yields the best results.

It is likely that the success of Paccaloni’s “maximum Δp, maximum rate” procedure is due to improved acid coverage (discussed in the next section) and the minimization of precipitation damage. Unless experience in a particular area suggests otherwise, Paccaloni’s maximum Δp, maximum rate procedure is recommended and is described here.

There is always an upper bound on injection rate, since, to ensure a matrix treatment, the injection rate must be kept below the rate that will cause hydraulic fracture formation. The bottomhole pressure that will initiate a fracture (the breakdown pressure).

Most commonly, only the surface rate and tubing pressure are monitored during an acid job,.

As the skin effect decreases during acidizing, a higher injection rate is possible without fracturing the formation. To ensure that fracturing does not occur, it is usually recommended that the surface tubing pressure be maintained about 10% below the pressure that would initiate fracturing. For this well, a prudent design would begin with an injection rate of 0.1 bpm, which could be increased while keeping the surface pressure below 2000 psi.

(1) The acid should be injected at the maximum rate and hence, maximum pwf possible without fracturing the formation; and (2) the treatment should be monitored in real time to ensure that the maximum rate objective is being met and to determine when sufficient acid has been injected into the formation.

As the treatment proceeds, the wellhead pressure is plotted against the injection rate and the evolving skin effect can be read from the graph. The fracture pressure versus injection rate is also plotted on this graph, so that the rate can be held at the highest possible value without fracturing the formation.

A drawback to Paccaloni’s method is that it will tend to overestimate the skin effect because it neglects transient flow effects, as pointed out by Prouvost and Economides (1988) and confirmed by Paccaloni and Tambini.

Linear relationship between inverse injectivity, Δp/q, and a time function) for gas.

When the reservoir pressure is high enough, gas viscosity, μ, and compressibility, Z, are directly proportional to pressure, and the pressure transient flow equation for a constant flow rate can.

This effect on the injection pressure of a bank of fluid of one viscosity displacing a fluid of another can be accounted for with an apparent viscous skin factor,.

Because the viscosity of the injected acid.

Because the viscosity of the injected acid is typically many times larger than the viscosity of the gas being displaced, the apparent viscous skin factor can be quite large.

On the other hand, when acidizing oil wells, because the viscosity of the oil is often similar to the viscosity of the acid or larger, the viscous skin factor is small, and will be negative when oil viscosity is greater than acid viscosity.

Treatment is proper placement of the acid so that all of the productive intervals are contacted by sufficient volumes of acid. If there are significant variations in reservoir permeability, the acid will tend to flow primarily into the highest-permeability zones, leaving lower-permeability zones virtually untreated. Even in relatively homogeneous formations, the damage may not be distributed uniformly; without the use of techniques to improve the acid placement, much of the damage may be left untreated. Thus the distribution of the acid into the formation is a very important consideration in matrix acidizing, and a treatment design should include plans for acid placement.

The surest method for obtaining uniform acid placement is to isolate individual zones mechanically and treat all zones successively. Mechanical isolation can be accomplished with an opposed cup packer (perforation wash tool), the combination of a squeeze packer and a retrievable bridge plug, or inflatable straddle packers.

Ball sealers are rubber-coated balls that are designed to seat in the perforations in the casing, thereby diverting injected fluid to other perforations.

Most commonly, ball sealers are more dense than the treating fluid, so that after treatment, the ball sealers will fall into the rathole.

A common method of improving placement in matrix acidizing treatments is through the use of particulate diverting agents. Particulate diverting agents are fine particles that form a relatively low-permeability filter cake on the formation face. The pressure drop through this filter cake increases the flow resistance, diverting the acid to other parts of the formation where less diverting agent has been deposited. Diverting agents are either added to the treating fluid continuously, or in batches between stages of acid.

The presence of diverting agents complicates the diagnosis of acid treatments because the diverting agent is continuously adding a pressure drop at the wellbore. Simultaneously, the acid is removing damage, decreasing the flow resistance near the wellbore. These two effects can be properly accounted for only with a comprehensive acidizing model, such as that presented by Taha et al. (1989). However, approximate models of the overall process can be helpful in designing diversion and interpreting the effect of diversion on the real-time rate/pressure behavior during an acid treatment.

As acidizing proceeds, the skin effect will decrease until the damage has been almost entirely removed. After this point has been reached, the skin effect will change very slowly and can be approximated as being zero. The volume of acid needed to reduce the skin effect to zero can be estimated based on an acidizing model,.

Gels, foamed acid, and viscoelastic surfactant solutions are being used increasingly as a means of improving acid placement. With these fluids, the mechanism of diversion is viscous diversion, the increase in flow resistance in higher-permeability regions due to the presence of a bank of viscous fluid.

Before the HF/HCl mixture is injected in a sandstone acidizing treatment, a preflush of hydrochloric acid, most commonly a 15 wt% solution, is usually injected. The primary purpose of the preflush is to prevent the precipitation of species such as calcium fluoride when the HF solution contacts the formation. The HCl preflush accomplishes this by dissolving the carbonate minerals, displacing ions such as calcium and magnesium from the near-wellbore vicinity, and lowering the pH around the wellbore.

With HCl, the HF/HCl mixture can be injected without a preflush. In this instance, the objective is not to obtain an optimal stimulation treatment, but to remove enough damage to establish communication with.

In situations where injectivity cannot be established with HCl, the HF/HCl mixture can be injected without a preflush. In this instance, the objective is not to obtain an optimal stimulation treatment, but to remove enough damage to establish communication with the formation for testing purposes.

When the HCl solution enters the formation, it dissolves carbonate minerals rapidly but does not react to a great extent with other minerals. HCl does leach aluminum from clay minerals while not dissolving the entire clay molecule structure.

The preflush volume is selected by assuming a distance to which all carbonates should be removed by the preflush and then calculating the acid volume required.

After a sufficient volume of HF/HCl solution has been injected, it is displaced from the tubing and the wellbore with a postflush. A variety of fluids have been used for the post-flush, including diesel, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solutions, and HCl. The post-flush displaces the spent acid farther from the wellbore so that any precipitates that may form will be less damaging. As a minimum, the post-flush volume should be the volume of the tubing plus twice the volume of the wellbore below the tubing. Because of gravity segregation effects (Hong and Millhone, 1977), at least this much post-flush is needed to displace all acid from the wellbore.

Corrosion inhibitors, iron-sequestering compounds, surfactants, and mutual solvents. Acid additives should be tested carefully to ensure compatibility with other chemicals in the acid solution and with the formation fluids; only those that provide a clear benefit should be included in the treating fluids.

The corrosion inhibitors used are organic compounds containing polar groups that are attracted to the metal surface. Corrosion inhibitors are usually proprietary formulations, so it is the responsibility of the service company supplying the acid to recommend the type and concentration of corrosion inhibitor to be used in a particular acid treatment.

An iron-sequestering compound, usually EDTA, is sometimes added to acid solutions when it is thought that ferric ions (Fe3+) are present in the near-wellbore region in order to prevent the precipitation of Fe(OH)3 in the spent acid solution.

Surfactants are added to acid solutions to prevent the formation of emulsions, to speed cleanup of spent acid, and to prevent sludge formation. Like sequestering agents, surfactants may have deleterious effects on the formation and should be used only after careful testing with the formation fluids and core samples.

A mutual solvent is added to the post-flush—it improves productivity apparently by removing corrosion inhibitor that has absorbed on formation surfaces (Crowe and Minor, 1985) and by restoring water-wet conditions.

All solutions to be injected should be tested to ensure that they conform to the design formulations; (2) all necessary steps should be taken to minimize the damage caused by the acidizing process itself; and (3) the acidizing process should be monitored by measuring the rate and pressure (surface and/or bottomhole). McLeod (1984), Brannon et al. (1987), Paccaloni and Tambini (1988), and numerous others have clearly shown the importance of these guidelines.

Before an acidizing treatment in a sandstone formation is undertaken, there should be a clear indication that low well productivity is due, at least in part, to acid-soluble formation damage. This can be determined through a pretreatment pressure transient test to measure the skin effect, an analysis of other possible sources of skin, as shown in Chapter 6, and an assessment of the source of formation damage. A prestimulation production log is also helpful in some cases in planning the treatment and as a baseline for post-treatment analysis.

Surface equipment can be cleaned prior to being brought to the location or on site with the acid solution itself. If the production tubing is to be used for acid injection, an HCl solution or other cleaning fluids should be circulated down the tubing and back to the surface before injection into the formation begins. This process is called tubing pickling.

Or bottomhole pressure should be monitored. The real-time monitoring discussed in this chapter can then be applied to optimize the treatment. Occasional.

During the treatment, the injection rate and surface or bottomhole pressure should be monitored. The real-time monitoring discussed in this chapter can then be applied to optimize the treatment.

Be an important diagnostic aid. When acid injection has been completed, the well should be flowed back immediately to minimize damage by reaction product precipitation.

In a clastic formation, the surface reaction rates are slow and a relatively uniform acid front moves through the porous medium.

In carbonates, surface reaction rates are very high, so mass transfer often limits the overall reaction rate, leading to highly nonuniform dissolution patterns. Often, a few large channels, called wormholes, are created,.

The structure of these wormhole patterns depends on many factors, including (but not limited to) flow geometry, injection rate, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer rates.

Since wormholes are much larger than the pores in nonvuggy carbonates, the pressure drop through the region penetrated by wormholes is small and can often be neglected.

Thus, in matrix acidizing, knowledge of the depth of penetration of wormholes allows a prediction of the effect of acidizing on the skin effect.

The objective of a carbonate acidizing treatment is to create wormholes penetrating deep enough into the formation to bypass any damaged region and, often, to create a significantly negative skin factor.

Thus, unlike sandstone acidizing where the objective is to overcome formation damage effects, matrix stimulation of carbonates creates sufficient productivity enhancement to make it an attractive procedure even in the absence of formation damage. For this reason, and because of its simplicity and relatively low cost, most wells in carbonate formations are acid stimulated.

Strong acid solutions, usually viscosified by adding polymers or creating emulsions, are injected at pressures.

Acid fracturing is a stimulation method in which strong acid solutions, usually viscosified by adding polymers or creating emulsions, are injected at pressures above the fracturing pressure.

Depending primarily on rock characteristics, in some formations, acid fracturing is a cost-effective way to create a conductive hydraulic fracture.

Wormholes form in a dissolution process when the large pores grow at a rate substantially higher than the rate at which smaller pores grow, so that a large pore receives an increasingly larger proportion of the dissolving fluid, eventually becoming a wormhole.

Mass transfer-limited reactions.

Surface reaction rate-limited reactions.

The kinetics are mixed, and both surface reaction rate and mass transfer rate are important.

The natural tendency for wormholes to form when reaction is mass transfer limited has been demonstrated theoretically by Schechter and Gidley.

And 16-2. Thus, whether or not wormholes will form, and the structure of the wormholes that do form, depend on the relative rates of surface reaction, diffusion, and fluid loss, all of which depend on the overall convection rate of the acid.

For a given rock, acid system, and temperature, a progression of dissolution patterns occur as injection rate is increased. The typical dissolution patterns created when HCl.

Thus, the key to most efficient acid stimulation is to design an acid system that can be injected into the well at flow rates that would lead to dominant wormholing.

The progression presented here depends on the relative magnitudes of the diffusion and surface reaction rates and also on the flow geometry because of the role of fluid loss from the wormholes.

When the flow rate is below the optimum, the volume of acid needed to propagate a wormhole a certain distance decreases rapidly as the injection rate increases, but when the wormhole propagation is above the optimal, the volume of acid required increases only gradually with increasing injection rate. This means that it is better to inject at a rate above the optimum than at too low a rate.

With a lower reaction rate, substantially more acid is needed to propagate a wormhole a given distance,.

Hydrochloric acid is by far the most common acid used in carbonate matrix acidizing. Table 16-1 shows the acids suggested by McLeod (1984) for various acid treatments of carbonate formations. Weak acids are suggested for perforation cleanup and perforating fluid, but otherwise, strong solutions of HCl are recommended.

For a matrix treatment, HCl should be used unless corrosion considerations require a weaker acid (this would occur only in deep, hot wells).

All models of wormhole propagation predict deeper penetration for higher acid concentrations, so a high concentration of HCl is preferable.

Also, in carbonates, there are usually no precipitation reactions to limit the acid concentrations used, as is the case in sandstones. However, if sulfate-rich water, such as seawater, is used to mix the acid solution, or is used in conjunction with acid injection as a spacer, preflush, or post-flush fluid, precipitation of CaSO4 may occur and cause formation damage.

60°C. If the well injectivity does not allow a flux that is near the optimal or above for a strong acid solution, it may be advantageous to use a weaker acid, such as acetic acid,.

60°C. If the well injectivity does not allow a flux that is near the optimal or above for a strong acid solution, it may be advantageous to use a weaker acid, such as acetic acid, because the optimal flux for the weaker acid is lower.

The volume of acid to be injected in carbonate acidizing is based on the desired level of stimulation to be achieved. The more acid injected, the deeper into the formation wormholes propagate, and the lower the created skin factor.

The injection rate schedule for a carbonate acidizing treatment is a very important design variable because of the sensitivity of the wormholing process to the flux of acid into the unstimulated rock ahead of the dissolution front. However, once an acid system has been selected, the best rate schedule is to simply inject at the highest rate possible without fracturing the formation,.

At injection rates below the optimum, wormholing becomes very inefficient, while at rates above the optimum, the efficiency decreases slowly with increased rate.

The higher injection rate causes more wormhole branching, but wormholes continue to propagate. Because of this trend, and the fact that optimal injection conditions cannot be precisely created in the field because of variability in injectivity along a well and other uncertainties, injecting at the highest rate possible is the best approach. This also means that as the well is stimulated and injectivity increases, the injection rate should be steadily increased.

A matrix acidizing treatment in a carbonate reservoir should be monitored by measuring the injection rate and pressure during injection, just as a sandstone acidizing treatment is monitored.

Carbonates are such large channels, it is generally assumed that the pressure drop through the wormhole region is negligible, so that the effect of the wormholes on the well skin effect is the same as enlarging the wellbore. With this assumption, the skin evolution in a carbonate matrix acidizing treatment can be predicted with the models of wormhole propagation.

Adequate placement of acid into all zones to be stimulated is as important in acidizing carbonates as it is in sandstones, and the same fluid placement techniques are applicable. However, because of the formation of wormholes, particulates should be used with caution because of potential difficulty in removing them. Viscous diversion is commonly used in carbonate acidizing, with viscosified acid systems including foamed acid, emulsified acid, and polymer-viscosified acid.

Viscoelastic surfactant acid systems are unique diverting materials in that these fluids have low viscosity until the acid spends, then the viscosity increases dramatically in the spent acid in which the calcium concentration and pH have both increased greatly.

Acid fracturing is a stimulation technique in which acid is injected at pressures above the parting pressure of the formation, so that a hydraulic fracture is created. Usually, a viscous pad fluid is injected ahead of the acid to initiate the fracture, then plain acid, gelled acid, foamed acid, or an emulsion containing acid is injected.

Thus, acid fracturing is an alternative to the use of proppants to create fracture conductivity after closure. The fracturing process itself is identical to that employed with proppant fracturing.

The primary issues to be addressed in designing an acid fracturing treatment are the penetration distance of live acid down the fracture, the conductivity created by the acid (and its distribution along the fracture), and the resulting productivity of an acid-fractured well. Since acid fracturing should be viewed as an alternative means of creating fracture conductivity in a carbonate formation, a comparison with proppant fracturing should generally be made when planning a possible acid fracturing treatment.

The conductivity (kfw) of an acid fracture is difficult to predict because it depends inherently on a stochastic process: If the walls of the fracture are not etched heterogeneously, very little fracture conductivity will result after closure.

The productivity of an acid-fractured well can be predicted in the same manner as for a well with a propped fracture (see Chapter 17 for details on propped fracture performance) if an average fracture conductivity adequately describes the well flow behavior. One complicating factor is that the conductivity of an acid fracture depends strongly on the closure stress, and the closure stress increases as the bottomhole.

The productivity of an acid-fractured well can be predicted in the same manner as for a well with a propped fracture (see Chapter 17 for details on propped fracture performance) if an average fracture conductivity adequately describes the well flow behavior. One complicating factor is that the conductivity of an acid fracture depends strongly on the closure stress, and the closure stress increases as the bottomhole flowing pressure decreases during the life of the well. Since pwf for a given flow rate depends on fracture conductivity and the fracture conductivity depends on the closure stress, and hence pwf, an iterative procedure is required to determine the productivity of an acid-fractured well.

The fact that acid fracturing is intended specifically for carbonate formations should not preclude the use of a propped fracture if it can be placed and has economic advantages.

Acid fractures will be relatively short and are by no means of infinite conductivity, particularly at high closure stress.

Horizontal wells present a distinct challenge for matrix acidizing, if for no other reason than simply because of the extent of the region to be acidized. To attempt to obtain the same acid coverage in a horizontal well with a length of, for example, 2000 ft, would require an acid volume and treating time much greater than that typically needed for vertical wells. Besides the much greater cost, corrosion inhibition during long periods of acid injection may limit the extent of matrix acidizing that is feasible in a horizontal well.

When fluid is pumped into the reservoir at a sufficiently high pressure, the reservoir rock will crack open. Continued pumping of the fluid at this pressure will propagate the crack into the reservoir. A slurry can be pumped into the crack to create a slab-shaped zone of high permeability known as a hydraulic fracture.

By 2012, hydraulic fracturing had emerged as a $20 billion annual activity, second only to drilling budgets in magnitude.

The hydraulic fracture design is highly dependent on the reservoir permeability.

The fracture accelerates production without impacting the well reserves.

In such reservoirs the rationale for fracturing frequently relies on net present value economics.

Low-permeability reservoirs (less than 1 md for oil and 0.01 md for gas), the hydraulic fracture greatly contributes both to well productivity and to the well reserves. More importantly, in such reservoirs the well would not produce an economic rate without the hydraulic fracture.

The concept of production and recovery acceleration, high-permeability reservoirs.

Production and reserves enhancement from hydraulic fracturing, low-permeability reservoirs.

Very low- and very high-permeability reservoirs pose additional challenges for hydraulic fracturing.

Very low permeability, such as tight gas and shale gas, the well drainage area is confined essentially to the stimulated reservoir volume created by multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells, as diagrammed in Figure 17-4. In very high permeability reservoirs,.

Very low permeability, such as tight gas and shale gas, the well drainage area is confined essentially to the stimulated reservoir volume created by multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells, as diagrammed in Figure 17-4. In very high permeability reservoirs, hydraulic fractures have a dual purpose—to stimulate the well and to provide sand control—and the latter justifies postponing much of the discussion of this strategy until.

Horizotal Well is drilled in parallel to direction of minimum principal stress.

What fracturing accomplishes is to alter the way the fluids enter the wellbore, changing from near-well radial flow to linear or bilinear flow.

Implies that the flow is from the reservoir into the fracture and then along the fracture into the well.

It should be noted here that a hydraulic fracture bypasses the near-wellbore damage zone. Thus, the pretreatment skin effect has little or no impact on the post-fracture equivalent skin effect value.

Suppose that a reservoir is depicted as a countryside and the fracture is a road connecting two far-off points. Where there is an excellent and dense system of wide roads (high-permeability-reservoir analog), relative improvement of the traffic flow would require even wider (more lanes) and faster freeways. This translates to high-permeability and wide fractures. Therefore, in moderate- to high-permeability reservoirs, a large fracture width is necessary, while the fracture length is of secondary importance.

Poor road system (low-permeability analog), a long road connecting as much of the countryside as possible.

Conversely, in a countryside with a sparse and poor road system (low-permeability analog), a long road connecting as much of the countryside as possible is indicated. Such a long road could bring about a major improvement in traffic flow. In fact, the poorer the existing road system, the lower the relative requirements would be from the new road. By analogy, the length of the fracture in a lower-permeability reservoir is the priority; fracture permeability and width are secondary. Thus, in designing a hydraulic fracture treatment, fracture length, width, and proppant pack permeability must be suited to the formation properties, especially formation permeability.

Every hydraulic fracture can be characterized by its length, conductivity, and related equivalent skin effect.

The created fracture length relates to the length of the crack propagated during the hydraulic fracture treatment execution. The conductive fracture length refers to the length of the fracture remaining open when the well is on production, thereby effectively providing an enhanced path for fluid production to the well.

The conductive length is assumed to consist of two equal half-lengths, xf, extending in opposite directions from the well. In the following definitions and in the remainder of this chapter and the following chapter, the term fracture length, denoted by xf, will always refer to the conductive fracture half length.

The fracture permeability, kf, and the fracture width, w.

The fracture conductivity is given by the product of the fracture permeability, kf, and the fracture width, w.

When the fracture half length approaches the effective radius of the well drainage area, the concepts of equivalent skin and effective well radius do not apply.

Radial and pseudoradial flow are also called infinite-acting radial flow and occur only as long as the radius of the pressure disturbance due to production is less than the distance to the nearest boundary of the well drainage area.

Such high conductivity fractures are said to have effectively infinite conductivity,.

Implies that in this case the reservoir drains to a well with an effective wellbore radius equal to half of the fracture half length.

Relate the dimensionless productivity index, JD, with the well skin effect for a vertical well under radial flow.

When pseudoradial flow emerges after fracture bilinear and/or linear flow, the skin determined from a pressure buildup test will be the equivalent skin effect indicated.

When the fracture height is greater than the reservoir height, h, a distinction must be made between the productive fracture height, h, equal to the reservoir height, and the propped fracture height, hf.

Thus, there exists only one optimum conductivity that maximizes the productivity index, and this conductivity corresponds to a particular fracture width and length.

Narrower fracture width would mean that the fracture becomes a bottleneck; shorter fracture length would mean that the reservoir becomes the bottleneck.

Fracture half length is sufficiently small compared to the well drainage area that pseudoradial flow can occur.

Because a given volume of proppant with a specified permeability was assumed, thereby fixing the proppant cost, this represents not just maximum productivity, but optimum productivity as well for the assumed proppant expenditure.

Key to this approach is the idea that for a given proppant volume and well drainage area and shape there is a fracture half length, width, and conductivity that maximize the well productivity.

Expands the above approach to include fracture and well drainage area dimensions that will not reach pseudoradial flow before the onset of pseudosteady state. Key to this approach is the idea that for a given proppant volume and well drainage area and shape there is a fracture half length, width, and conductivity that maximize the well productivity.

Since small proppant numbers would mean relatively small treatments or large drainages and thus fracture performance would reach pseudoradial flow before the onset of pseudosteady-state flow.

Figure 17-9), the fracture penetration approaches the drainage boundaries (Ix = 1 is a fully penetrating fracture) and the boundaries normal to the fracture plane force.

However, as the proppant number increases (Figure 17-9), the fracture penetration approaches the drainage boundaries (Ix = 1 is a fully penetrating fracture) and the boundaries normal to the fracture plane force the flow to remain linear or bilinear, both of which are far more efficient than radial, until eventually pseudosteady-state flow develops.

When the proppant number increases, due to increased propped volume or lower reservoir permeability, the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity also increases.

For hydraulically fractured wells in low-permeability reservoirs, the time required to reach the pseudosteady-state flow condition described in the previous sections can be long, sometimes even longer than the productive life of the well. The productivity of such wells is predicted using transient flow models or numerically generated type curves that describe the transient flow period. Commonly used models are based on idealizations of the flow regime as being bilinear flow, linear flow in the formation, or pseudoradial flow, as described in Chapter 13. These models are very useful in pressure transient test analysis, but are less helpful for production forecasting because of gaps in the periods of applicability of each model and inconsistent transitions.

If the fracture conductivity is sufficiently greater than the reservoir’s capacity to deliver fluid to the fracture, the pressure drop in the fracture is negligible, and the fracture is treated as having infinite conductivity.

When the fracture conductivity is too low for the infinite conductivity solutions to apply, type curves can be used to generate production forecast.

In many hydraulically fractured gas wells, the additional pressure drop caused by non-Darcy flow in the fracture itself causes lower productivity than would occur with Darcy flow.

For high-rate gas wells, a simple, conservative approach, as suggested by Gidley (1991), is to use the velocity at the wellbore to estimate the effects of non-Darcy flow on well productivity.

Because the non-Darcy flow effect is rate-dependent, the flow rate must be known to determine productivity, and the problem is iterative.

Non-Darcy effects have an additional impact in production optimization. Hydraulic fractures should be redesigned to have a larger width to accommodate the reduction in the effective proppant pack permeability. Thus, for a given mass of proppant the geometry of the fracture and the relationship between length and width must be adjusted depending on the magnitude of the non-Darcy effects. The UFD approach does this in a coherent fashion.

An increasing amount of oil and, more commonly, gas is being produced from very low—permeability formations, referred to as unconventional resources. Such reservoirs include tight gas sand and shale resources, which share the common feature that economic recovery of hydrocarbons requires fracture stimulation.

Advanced hydraulic fracture stimulation technology is the key to economically accessing these reserves, with the creation of multiple hydraulic fractures from either vertical or horizontal wells often required.

These reservoirs have permeabilities less than 0.1 md and as low as 0.001 md. To.

These reservoirs have permeabilities less than 0.1 md and as low as 0.001 md. To produce commercial quantities of gas, these reservoirs must be comprised of thick formations, or there must be multiple sand bodies that are penetrated by each well. A typical tight gas well is completed in very thick, stacked sands such as those of the Mesa Verde geological group in the Piceance Basin of the western United States. The braided stream deposits in this formation result in numerous isolated sand bodies distributed over as much as 5000 feet of gross vertical interval.

Reservoir simulators using a dual-porosity approach as has been applied for many years to simulate naturally fractured reservoirs are commonly used to forecast the performance of fractured shale wells. In this approach, one value of permeability is assigned to the matrix blocks, and another, higher permeability is assigned to the fracture network. It is also possible to have different conductivities in the main fractures compared with orthogonal, stimulated natural fractures.

A semi-analytical modeling approach for the multiple fracture production problem is to treat the fractures as containing collections of pressure sinks that are communicating with each other through the fractures and through the low-permeability formation. This approach typically requires some numerical method be applied, such as numerical inversion of an analytical solution in Laplace space.

The previous chapter presented methods to determine what sort of hydraulic fracture would optimize well performance for a given reservoir, and methods to forecast well performance for assumed fracture conditions.

Techniques needed to design and execute the hydraulic fracturing process to achieve the treatment goals. A fracturing treatment design begins with the desired fracture geometry and fracture conductivity. Then, appropriate fracture fluids and proppants are selected, and treatment volume, pumping schedule, and proppant loading schedule are designed to achieve the desired final fracture geometry.

Conventional, biwing fracture design and the planned creation of multiple fractures or, in some cases, the creation of multiple fractures coupled with activation of existing natural fractures.

Except for very low–permeability reservoirs, biwing fracture design procedures are appropriate.

For very low (microdarcy) and ultra-low (nanodarcy) reservoir permeabilities, the creation of high fracture density with multiple fractures is a critical part of the overall well completion and fracture treatment design.

Finally, in low-permeability reservoirs having low contrast in horizontal stress and preexisting natural fracture networks, such as some shale formations, the goal of fracturing is to create complex fracture networks as a combination of new hydraulic fractures and stimulated natural fractures.

The created fracture geometry (height, width, length, and azimuth) can be approximated for given pumping conditions using analytical 2-D models of fracture propagation. These models combine elastic fracture mechanics, fluid transport in the fracture, fluid leakoff from the fracture, and material balances on the fluid and the proppant to calculate the created fracture geometry and the resulting proppant distribution.

The fracture geometry created is tailored by selecting the most appropriate fracture fluids and proppants. The physical properties of fracture fluids and proppants that must be known for fracture design are also reviewed here. Finally, modern methods for diagnosing the fracture created, often applied in real time, are presented.

Execution of a hydraulic fracture involves the injection of fluids at a pressure sufficiently high to cause tensile failure of the rock.

At the fracture initiation pressure, often known as the “breakdown pressure,” the rock opens. As additional fluids are injected, the opening is extended and the fracture propagates.

A reservoir at depth is under a state of stress. This situation can be characterized by the stress vectors. In a geologically stable environment, three principal stresses can be identified. Their directions coincide with the directions where all shear stresses vanish. These are the vertical direction and two horizontal directions for minimum and maximum horizontal stresses.

A hydraulic fracture will be normal to the smallest of the three stresses because it will open and displace the rock against the least resistance.

In the vast majority of reservoirs to be hydraulically fractured, the minimum horizontal stress is the smallest, leading to vertical hydraulic fractures.

The direction (azimuth) of the hydraulic fracture plane will be perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction.

Stress, which corresponds to the weight of the overburden.

The most readily understood stress is the vertical stress, which corresponds to the weight of the overburden.

The vertical stress is translated horizontally through the Poisson relationship, which in its simplest expression has the form.

This stress is the absolute stress, and in the case of a porous medium, since the weight of the overburden will be carried by both the grains and the fluid within the pore space, the effective stress, , is defined.

Poisson ratio.

Where is the effective horizontal stress and v is the Poisson ratio. This variable is a rock property. For sandstones it is approximately equal to 0.25, implying that the effective horizontal stress is approximately one-third the effective vertical stress.

The absolute horizontal stress decreases with fluid production.

Fracture injection tests, known as “data fracs” or “minifracs,” and their analysis are employed for such measurements.

The magnitude of the breakdown pressure is characteristic of the values and the respective differences of the principal stresses, the tensile stress, and the reservoir pressure.

Since there will be a nonvanishing shear stress component.

Complex fracture geometries are likely to be encountered at depths greater than this level. Fractures may be initiated vertically but may turn horizontal (T-shape fractures) when (and if) the minimum stress plus the fracture net pressure exceed the overburden stress. A.

Complex fracture geometries are likely to be encountered at depths greater than this level. Fractures may be initiated vertically but may turn horizontal (T-shape fractures) when (and if) the minimum stress plus the fracture net pressure exceed the overburden stress. A T-shape geometry is invariably undesirable, since the width of the horizontal branch is very small, resulting in substantial fluid loss during propped fracture propagation, slurry dehydration, and “screenouts.” (A screenout is when there is not sufficient pressure to propagate the fracture because of extra resistance as the slurry cannot suspend the proppant.

Primary fracture propagates in the direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction, and hence in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress. The azimuthal direction of hydraulic fractures can.

A primary fracture propagates in the direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction, and hence in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress.

Van Everdingen and Hurst (1949) quantified the condition of the near-wellbore region with the introduction.

This is an interesting finding. In a damaged well, with, for example, s = 10, the reservoir drains into a well with an effective radius equal to 4.5 × 10–5 rw. Conversely,.

Fracture direction is normal to the minimum resistance. This is represented by the absolute minimum stress.

Fracture length much larger than the fracture height.

A wide variety of fluids have been used for fracturing, including water, aqueous solutions of polymers with or without crosslinkers, gelled oils, viscoelastic surfactant solutions, foams, and emulsions. The most common fluids used now are “slickwater”–water with a small amount of polymer added to reduce frictional pressure drop and solutions of the natural polymer guar, or its derivatives, particularly hydroxypropyl guar (HPG).

The fracture fluid serves to create the fracture and to transport the proppant.

High apparent viscosity is desirable to create greater fracture width, suspend the proppant as it is transported down the fracture, and minimize leakoff.

Low-viscosity fluids, on the other hand, can be pumped at a higher rate because of lower frictional pressure drop and can more easily penetrate into narrow secondary fractures created in complex fracturing of ultra-low-permeability formations.

Almost all desirable and undesirable properties of fracturing fluids are related to their apparent viscosity,.

Almost all desirable and undesirable properties of fracturing fluids are related to their apparent viscosity, which in turn is a function of the polymer load.

Most fracturing fluids are not Newtonian, and the most commonly used model to describe their rheological behavior is the power.

Most fracturing fluids are not Newtonian, and the most commonly used model to describe their rheological behavior is the power law.

Because of the high rate injection needed to create sufficient pressure to fracture the rock and to propagate hydraulic fractures deep into the reservoir, the frictional pressure drop caused by fracturing fluids is very important.

To minimize friction during flow down the well tubulars, most fracturing fluids contain polymers that reduce the frictional pressure drop caused by the fluid.

Slickwater fracture fluids contain low concentrations of polymers, most commonly polyacrylamide based, to reduce friction.

The purpose of the proppant is to provide a conductive pathway from the reservoir to the wellbore by keeping the fracture from closing once the high pressure applied to create the fracture is relieved.

Conductivity—The conductivity created by the proppant depends on the proppant mean size and size distribution, the proppant loading or concentration after closure (Cp), and the packing of the proppant.

Transportability—A desirable proppant can be transported far down a created hydraulic fracture. Because almost all proppants are considerably denser than the fracture fluids that carry them, proppant settling affects the ability to transport proppant down a fracture.

It is also important to consider that the closure stress depends on the pressure in the fracture,.

It is also important to consider that the closure stress depends on the pressure in the fracture, and thus is likely to increase over the life of a fractured well as declining reservoir pressure results in lower wellbore pressure.

The conductivity created by a proppant also depends on the size of the proppant, with larger proppant sizes creating higher-permeability proppant packs and hence, higher conductivities.

This increase is predicated on the proppant pack being undamaged, as finer particles added to larger size proppants can result in much lower conductivity.

The conductivity of propped fractures is very susceptible to reductions caused by invasion of smaller particles into the proppant pack, crushing of some of the proppant particles, embedment of the proppant into the fracture surfaces, permeability reduction caused by unbroken polymer gels from the fracture fluid, two-phase flow effects, and non-Darcy flow effects.

However, because almost all proppants are significantly denser than the fracturing fluid transporting them, the proppant will settle, and more proppant is deposited in the lower part of the created fracture. The rate of proppant settling in a power law fluid can be estimated.

Fracture diagnostic methods that are aimed at determining the geometry of the fracture or fractures created, often applied in real time, have contributed greatly to improvements in the fracturing process.

Monitoring the net pressure in real time is a routine part of hydraulic fracturing operations.

Diagnostic procedures have been developed to measure many aspects of the created fracture geometry, including height, length, and azimuth.

The primary techniques for monitoring fracture geometry are microseismic monitoring, tiltmeter monitoring, temperature profile measurements, and tracer methods.

Microseismic mapping is extensively used with shale fracturing to measure the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), the product of the area affected by complex fracturing and the height of the created fractures.

Another means of detecting the geometry of hydraulic fractures is measuring very small earth movements with inclinometers or tiltmeters.

As a fracture propagates, the formations around it are deformed, and these deformations can be detected with extremely sensitive measurements of the change in angle of a solid rod attached to the deforming surface.

Fracture characteristics, at least in the near well vicinity, have been diagnosed for many years using chemical or radioactive tracers and temperature profiles. By tagging fracture fluids and/or proppants with chemical markers or radioactive isotopes, the location where these tracers remain near the wellbore can then be detected with logging methods. King (2010) reviewed these tracer methods, particularly the use of multiple tracers to diagnose where fractures were created in multistage fracturing.

Because fracturing fluid is typically much cooler than the formation being fractured, the wellbore contiguous with the fracture is cooler than other parts of the wellbore and hence, a temperature log run shortly after a fractured well is shut in can identify the fractured interval as the location of a cool anomaly.

The combination of horizontal wellbores and multiple hydraulic fractures provides a means to maximize wellbore contact with a reservoir, and is crucial to economic development of lowpermeability reservoirs.

Unlike vertical well fracturing, most fracturing jobs in horizontal wells are aimed at creating multiple fractures, either by single-stage pumping or multistage pumping with isolation provided by the completion.

New challenges in horizontal well fracturing include, but are not limited to, orientation of horizontal wells for favorable stress fields to create the desired type of fractures, successfully propagating multiple fractures, less trips and effective isolation between fracturing stages, significantly larger volume of treatments, and creation of extremely complex fracture network systems in shale formations.

The main reason to create longitudinal fractures is to break the vertical barriers when a horizontal well is placed in a relatively thick formation with impermeable laminations in the formation (low vertical permeability). Fractures in such a case will contribute the necessary vertical permeability for a horizontal well to produce. On the other hand, creating transverse fractures is aimed at creating extensive contact with reservoirs that have too low a permeability to produce without stimulation. This type of fracturing has become a common practice in tight sand gas formation or shale oil and gas formations. In fact, multiple transverse fracturing is the only means by which unconventional shale formations can be economically producible.

There are three common ways to complete horizontal wells for multiple fracturing, either longitudinal or transverse: open-hole uncontrolled fracturing, open hole with liners and isolation for controlled multiple-stage fracturing, and cased hole with perforated completion for multiple fracturing. Open-hole uncontrolled fracturing can generate fractures in one or more stages; the other two completion types generate multiple fractures with multiple stages.

An openhole completion for fracturing in an open hole is the simplest and most economical way to fracture a horizontal well. It allows fractures to initiate and propagate at the locations of weak points in the formation rock along the wellbore. Multiple fractures can be created in such a treatment, but the locations of the fractures cannot be predetermined or controlled.

This practice can only be used in competent formations. The critical problem with this method is the lack of control of fracture locations, borehole stability, and sand production.

To better control the location and propagation of multiple fractures, it is common to set liners in open hole with sections isolated in the annulus between the borehole and the liner. The isolation can be achieved either by hydraulically operated inflatable external casing packers (ECPs) or with swelling packers that swell on contact with oil or water.

Multiple sleeves (also commonly called fracture ports) are installed along a liner. Beginning with the sleeve.

During the fracture execution, the isolation balls are dropped into the well one at a time. The balls have two functions: to open a fracture port and to isolate the downstream wellbore behind the port so that a fracture can be initiated at the port. The smallest ball is dropped first to the end of the horizontal wellbore to establish pressure integrity inside the liner.

When fracture stimulation is completed, the balls in the horizontal well should flow back by the well production.

The perforation gun is designed to be able to perforate more than one interval.

Although formation solids are not always sand, in the petroleum industry, the production of any solids from a well is generally called sand production.

Produced solids can accumulate in the well or in subsea or surface flow lines, destroy a downhole pump, or erode various well hardware including slotted liners or screens, gas-lift valves, the surface choke, or any bends in surface pipe.

The cost to remediate consequences of sand production can vary depending on the difficulty to remove accumulated sand or replace worn equipment or eroded hardware.

The critical sanding rate is the production rate at or below which sand production is avoided. The critical sanding rate may drop over time due to changes in the completion or the flow stream. For example, many wells do not produce formation fines until water breakthrough.

Sand management is a term applied to well completion designs that either prevent sand production by monitoring and controlling the well flow rate and/or drawdown, or permit sand production and plan for handling and disposing of produced sand.

Sand exclusion applies to well completions designed to prevent any sand production into the wellbore.

One strategy to achieve sand exclusion is by filtering produced solids before they can be produced into the wellbore with a gravel pack.

Another strategy is to reduce the flow velocity at the formation face by designing the flow geometry with more contact area between the completion and the formation, as with high-angle, horizontal, multilateral, and hydraulically fractured wells.

In general, formation solids may become loose after a shear, volumetric, or tensile failure.

The purpose of sand flow modeling is to predict the conditions under which sand production is expected.

Instead, the sand management approach is to perforate and complete the well without a gravel pack and then produce below the critical drawdown or below the critical sand flow rate indicated by the sand flow model.

If, for example, the production tubing limits the well flow rate to remain below the predicted critical sanding rate, then the well completion design need not require sand exclusion.

Failure due to high effective stress will occur when the difference between the in situ formation stress and the well pressure exceeds the compressive rock strength.

Tensile failure occurs when the rock is under tension and may occur whenever the pressure gradient is high.

In turn, sand arches can be destroyed under sufficiently high fluid flow velocity, or they may be eroded. Once into the wellbore, sand particles will either fall to collect at the bottom of the well, or at high enough fluid flow rate will be produced to the surface.

First, the curves for shear failure occur for large drawdown, even when the flow rate is small.

As flow rate increases, shear failure can occur for smaller drawdown. Comparing the initial perforation to the enlarged cavity (solid curve to dashed curve) reveals that shear failures become less likely after an initial failure enlarges the perforation cavity.

Unloading occurs when the formation is subjected to a sudden drop in pressure, as may occur when the well first starts flowing or during underbalanced perforating. Unloading can also occur after the well has been shut in for a fairly long period.

Often sand production either begins or increases significantly after water breakthrough.

(1) fines fixed by capillary pressure are released with free water saturation,.

(2) pressure gradient near the wellbore increases when oil and water flow together,.

(3) reservoir pressure may have depleted prior to the onset of waterflood pressure maintenance,.

(4) dissolution of cementing materials between sand grains by water, and.

(5) total fluid flow rate may be increased to maintain oil flow rate with increasing watercut.

Stokes’ law can be used to determine the velocity sufficient to lift sand particles to the surface assuming spherical particles and Newtonian liquids in laminar flow. This velocity, known as the slip velocity, us, must be at least 50% more than the terminal settling velocity.

Frequently, sand production occurs briefly each time the well is brought back on production after it has been shut.

In general, sand management without sand exclusion relies on avoiding flow velocity and drawdown sufficient to induce excessive sand production.

Any completion that does not provide for sand exclusion may be subject to sand production. Because sand exclusion completions are more expensive, and because gravel pack completions result in a positive skin from the beginning that grows in magnitude over time, the operator may prefer to avoid the need for sand exclusion, either by producing below the critical sanding rate or critical drawdown, or by deliberately producing sand in a well design that is not destroyed by sand production.

The cavity completion (cavity-like completion) risks some sand production in order to remove near wellbore damage and condition the completion.

Once the sand is produced, no further sand may be produced for a long time if drawdown is reduced somewhat.

Many reservoirs comprised of relatively young sediments are so poorly consolidated that sand will be produced along with the reservoir fluids unless the rate is restricted significantly. Sand production leads to numerous production problems, including erosion of downhole tubulars; erosion of valves, fittings, and surface flow lines; the wellbore filling up with sand; collapsed casing because of the lack of formation support; and clogging of surface processing equipment.

Many reservoirs comprised of relatively young sediments are so poorly consolidated that sand will be produced along with the reservoir fluids unless the rate is restricted significantly. Sand production leads to numerous production problems, including erosion of downhole tubulars; erosion of valves, fittings, and surface flow lines; the wellbore filling up with sand; collapsed casing because of the lack of formation support; and clogging of surface processing equipment. Even if sand production can be tolerated, disposal of the produced sand is a problem, particularly at offshore fields. Thus, a means to eliminate sand production without greatly limiting production rates is desirable.

Originally, sand production was controlled by using gravel pack completions, slotted liner completions, or sand consolidation treatments, with gravel pack completions having been by far the most common approach.

Operators noted that successful prepack gravel placement often posed a need to inject at pressures exceeding the formation fracture pressure. This led to development of the frac-pack approach designed to create a fracture extending past the radius of impaired permeability induced by drilling and completion fluid invasion.

A positive skin of 5–10 is considered excellent in traditional gravel pack completions, and much higher skins have been observed, leading to loss of as much as 50% of the well production capability.

High-rate water pack and frac-pack completions have achieved at best zero and even slightly negative total completion skins as low as –2. Reasons why hydraulic stimulation does not result in more negative skin even for typical fracture half lengths of more than 50 ft are provided in Section 19.4.2.

The gravel pack prevents sand production by trapping the particles, and over time the gravel pack skin will increase.

In contrast, because the flow geometry in the frac-pack provides greater flow area and, hence, less pressure gradient at the formation face, the frac-pack skin is not expected to increase over time, reducing or eliminating a need for completion maintenance.

The two most common types of gravel pack completions are an inside-casing gravel pack and an open-hole or underreamed-casing gravel pack.

A successful gravel pack completion must retain the formation sand and offer the least possible resistance to flow through the gravel itself.

For a successful gravel pack completion, gravel must be adjacent to the formation without having mixed with formation sand, and the annular space between the screen and the casing or formation must be completely filled with gravel. Special equipment and procedures have been developed over the years to accomplish good gravel placement.

Now, viscosified fluids, most commonly solutions of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), are used so that high concentrations of sand can be transported without settling.

In open-hole completions, the gravel-laden fluid can be pumped down the tubing casing annulus, after which the carrier fluid passes through the screen and flows back up the tubing.

Primary disadvantage of this method is the possibility of rust, pipe dope, or other debris being swept out of the annulus and mixed with the gravel, damaging the pack permeability.

A critical element in designing a gravel pack completion is the proper sizing of the gravel and the screen or slotted liner.

To perform its sand control function and maximize the permeability of the gravel pack, the gravel must be small enough to retain the formation sand, yet large enough that clay particles and other formation fines flow through the pack.

Measure accurately the formation particle size distribution.

The productivity of a gravel-packed well is affected by the pressure drop through the gravel pack, if this pressure drop is significant compared with the pressure drop in the formation.

As with any other type of completion, the effect of a gravel pack completion on well performance can be accounted for with a skin factor,.

The pressure drop through the gravel should be very small compared with the formation, unless the gravel permeability has been severely reduced by formation particles. If the productivity is expressed based on the radius.

The pressure drop through the gravel should be very small compared with the formation, unless the gravel permeability has been severely reduced by formation particles. If the productivity is expressed based on the radius of the liner and the gravel pack permeability is greater than the formation permeability, the gravel pack should contribute a small negative skin effect, since it will behave like a larger-diameter wellbore.

In the prepack phase of the gravel pack operation, sand is squeezed though the perforation tunnels as the transport fluid leaks off into the formation.

Furthermore, all gravel pack completions are subject to increasing skin over time as formation fines accumulate at the formation face or in the gravel pack itself. This mechanism is aggravated if most of the perforations become plugged with formation fines because the flow velocity in the formation is related to the well flow rate divided by the total flow area.

Unfocused γ-ray density logs can be used to locate the top of the gravel-packed section and to detect voids in gravel packs by measuring the density of the materials in the region of the well completion.

In unconsolidated formations, pumping above formation parting pressure can result in gravel being packed between the cement and the formation in addition to packing the perforation tunnels.

In the frac-pack literature this is called a halo.

Since, except for very shallow wells or highly overpressured formations, the maximum stress is the overburden stress, most hydraulic fractures propagate in a vertical plane. If the well trajectory is vertical, the hydraulic fracture will be aligned with the well.

Some authors have advocated orienting perforations with 180° phasing in the direction normal to minimum stress to improve fracture to wellbore connectivity.

We have seen already that high-performance fracturing completions should avoid sand production altogether, while gravel pack completions may restrict sand production to only very fine particles.

The spontaneous potential (SP) log deflects to the right in shale intervals; shows similar behavior to the resistivity opposite gas, oil, and water; and fails to distinguish between limestone and dolomite. The compensated neutron log (CNL) and the density log show similar responses in response to changes in fluid saturation and opposite shale intervals.

When added to ln(re/rw) for steady state, ln(0.472 re/rw) for pseudosteady state, or pD for transient solutions, the sum becomes proportional to the total (reservoir plus near-wellbore) pressure drop.

The wormholing process that occurs in carbonates makes it possible to obtain stimulation to sufficient radial penetrations that treating undamaged wells can be of great benefit. In carbonates, acid can also preferentially flow along natural fractures or in vug networks, making the potential depth of acid stimulation even greater. Thus, in carbonate reservoirs, matrix acidizing is often applied without the presence of formation damage.

Moderate permeability reservoirs (up to 50 md for oil and 1 md for gas), the fracture accelerates production without impacting the well reserves. In such reservoirs the rationale for fracturing frequently relies on net present value economics.

It is evident that the pseudosteady-state flow equation for a hydraulically fractured oil well would be.

For continuous gas lift, an “operating valve” is used to inject the appropriate amount of gas at the desirable tubing pressure at the injection point.

Most people will never know what they want. I don’t know what I want. If you ask me what I want to do in the next five months for language learning, on the other hand, I do know. It’s a matter of specificity. “What do you want?” is too imprecise to produce a meaningful and actionable answer. Forget about it.

The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom.

The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?”.

“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-mail, it would serve them forever,”.

Do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail.

Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.

“Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.”.

Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness.

Here are two truisms to keep in mind: Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.

What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency.

Is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.

What gets measured gets managed.

80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.

The effect on my self-esteem and state of mind just wasn’t worth the financial gain.

Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.

Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.

Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster.

He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead of showing dedication. Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat.

In the hindsight of being productive we only postpone the inevitable.

What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?.

Positive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping versus hurting you, and how do you increase your time with the former while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter?.

Exact numbers aren’t needed to realize that we spend too much time with those who poison us with pessimism, sloth, and low expectations of themselves and the world. It is often the case that you have to fire certain friends or retire from particular social circles to have the life you want. This isn’t being mean; it is being practical. Poisonous people do not deserve your time. To think otherwise is masochistic.

But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends.

If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?.

Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?.

Also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (www.rescuetime.com) to alert me when I spend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important (Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.).

It is a symptom of “task creep”—doing more to feel productive while actually accomplishing less.

You should have, at most, two primary goals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will result in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.

On a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.

What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.

“Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?” It’s not enough to use information.

“Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?”.

It’s not enough to use information for “something”—it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on either count, don’t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it.

Starting something doesn’t automatically justify finishing it.

If you are reading an article that sucks, put it down and don’t pick it back up. If you go to a movie and it’s worse than Matrix III, get the hell out of there before more neurons die. If you’re full after half a plate of ribs, put the damn fork down and don’t order dessert. More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it. Develop the habit of nonfinishing that which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn’t demanding it.

The more competing resellers there are, the faster your product goes extinct.

It works like this: Reseller A sells the product for your recommended advertised price of $50, then reseller B sells it for $45 to compete with A, and then C sells it for $40 to compete with A and B. In no time at all, no one is making profit from selling your product and reorders disappear. Customers are now accustomed to the lower pricing and the process is irreversible. The product is dead and you need to create a new product. This is precisely the reason why so many companies need to create new product after new product month after month. It’s a headache.

The first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of mistake is made with incomplete information, as it’s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged. Fortune favors the bold.

The second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something—wherein we refuse to change a bad situation out of fear despite having all the facts.

An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish. “How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked. “Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English. “Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked. “I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket. “But … What do you do with the rest of your time?” The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.” The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.” He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper management.” The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?” To which the American replied, “15–20 years. 25 tops.” “But what then, señor?” The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.” “Millions, señor? Then what?” “Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos …”.

Most oil reservoirs are of the volumetric type where the driving mechanism is the expansion of solution gas when reservoir pressure declines because of fluid production.

Obtain a high production rate of a well is to increase production pressure drawdown by reducing the bottom-hole pressure with artificial lift methods.

Beam pumping.”.

Provides mechanical energy to lift oil from bottom-hole to surface. It is efficient, simple, and easy for field people to operate. It can pump a well down to very low pressure to maximize oil production rate. It is applicable to slim holes, multiple completions, and high-temperature and viscous oils. The system is also easy to change to other wells with minimum cost. The major disadvantages of beam pumping include excessive friction in crooked/deviated holes, solid-sensitive problems, low efficiency in gassy wells, limited depth due to rod capacity, and bulky in offshore operations. Beam pumping trends include improved pump-off controllers, better gas separation, gas handling pumps, and optimization using surface and bottomhole cards.

Volumetric efficiency can decrease significantly due to the presence of free gas below the plunger.

As the fluid is elevated and gas breaks out of solution, there is a significant difference between the volumetric displacement of the bottom-hole pump and the volume of the fluid delivered to the surface. This effect is denoted by the shrinkage factor greater than 1.0, indicating that the bottom-hole pump must displace more fluid by some additional percentage than the volume delivered to the surface (Brown, 1980). The effect of gas on volumetric efficiency depends on solutiongas ratio and bottom-hole pressure.Down-hole devices, called “gas anchors,” are usually installed on pumps to separate the gas from the liquid.


# Applied Petroleum Reservoir Engineering (Terry, Ronald E.)

Traps An accumulation of hydrocarbon in a formation that occurs when the upward migration of hydrocarbon through a permeable rock is halted by a relatively impermeable cap rock.

Unconformity A surface between successive geologic strata representing a gap in the geologic record.

A reservoir is that portion of the trapped formation that contains oil and/or gas as a single hydraulically connected system.

Reservoir A subsurface geologic structure with sufficient porosity to store hydrocarbons.

Liquid produced at the surface from a fluid that is gas in the reservoir is called gas condensate because the liquid condenses from the gas phase.

An older name for gas condensate is gas distillate.

Volume of reservoir gas will produce both natural gas and condensate at the surface, and both gas and condensate volumes must be estimated.

A volume of reservoir oil will produce both oil and the associated dissolved gas at the surface, and both dissolved natural gas and crude oil volumes must be estimated.

The recoverable natural gas liquid (condensate) from the gas cap. Although the hydrocarbons in place are fixed quantities, which are referred to as the resource, the reserves depend on the mechanisms by which the reservoir is produced.

Reservoir engineering may be defined as the application of scientific principles to the drainage problems arising during the development and production of oil and gas reservoirs.

“the art of developing and producing oil and gas fluids in such a manner as to obtain a high economic recovery.”.

Subsurface geology, applied mathematics, and the basic laws of physics and chemistry governing the behavior of liquid and vapor phases of crude oil, natural gas, and water in reservoir rocks.

To account for all the reservoir fluid as pressure changes, a volume factor (B) is used. The volume factor is a ratio of the volume of the fluid at reservoir conditions to its volume at atmospheric conditions.

An M (1000) or MM (1 million) or MMM (1 billion) is.

An M (1000) or MM (1 million) or MMM (1 billion) is frequently placed before the units SCF.

The reservoir fluid typically sees only a decrease in pressure, while the produced fluid will experience decreases in pressure and in temperature.

As the fluid is produced from the reservoir, the pressure on the rock from the overburden or the rock above it remains constant but the pressure of the fluid surrounding it is decreasing. This leads the rock to expand or the pores in the rock to be compressed.

The compressibility factor is simply a ratio of how the gas would behave ideally compared to how it behaves in actuality.

The overall recovery efficiency E of any fluid displacement process is given by the product of the macroscopic, or volumetric displacement, efficiency, Ev, and the microscopic displacement efficiency, Ed.

The macroscopic displacement efficiency is a measure of how well the displacing fluid has contacted the oil-bearing parts of the reservoir.

The microscopic displacement efficiency is a measure of how well the displacing fluid mobilizes the residual oil once the fluid has contacted the oil.

The areal, Es, sweep efficiency and the vertical, Ei, sweep efficiency.

Interfacial and surface tension forces, wettability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability.

The forces per unit length acting at the fluid-fluid and rock-fluid interfaces are referred to as interfacial tensions.

The interfacial tension between two fluids represents the amount of work required to create a new unit of surface area at the interface.

The tendency for a solid to prefer one fluid over another is called wettability. Wettability is a function of the chemical composition of both the fluids and the rock. Surfaces can be either oil wet or water wet, depending on the chemical composition of the fluids.

Large, polar compounds in the oil phase can absorb onto the solid surface, leaving an oil film that may alter the wettability of the surface.

The pressure in the oil phase immediately above the oil-brine interface in the capillary tube will be slightly greater than the pressure in the water phase just below the interface. This difference in pressure is called the capillary pressure, Pc, of the system.

The greater pressure will always occur in the nonwetting phase.

Capillary pressures have also been found to be a function of the saturation history, although this dependence is not reflected in Eq. (10.2). For this reason, different values of capillary pressure are obtained during the drainage process (i.e., displacing the wetting phase by the nonwetting phase), then during the imbibitions process (i.e., displacing the nonwetting phase with the wetting phase). This hysteresis phenomenon is exhibited in all rock-fluid systems.

Pressure required to force a nonwetting phase through a small capillary can be very large.

Another factor affecting the microscopic displacement efficiency is the fact that when two or more fluid phases are present and flowing, the saturation of one phase affects the permeability of the other(s).

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it,.

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it, provided that the fluid saturates 100% of the pore space of the.

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it, provided that the fluid saturates 100% of the pore space of the rock.

The effective permeability, then, is the permeability of a rock to a particular fluid when that fluid has a pore saturation of less than 100%. As noted in the foregoing example, the sum of the effective permeabilities (i.e., 298 md) is always less than the absolute permeability, 413.

The critical saturation, the saturation at which oil first begins to flow as the oil saturation increases.

The critical saturation, the saturation at which oil first begins to flow as the oil saturation increases. It is also called the residual saturation, the value below which the oil saturation cannot be reduced in an oil-water system.

Because of this, at 20% water saturation, the water occupies the least favorable portions of the pore spaces—that is, as thin layers about the sand grains, as thin layers on the walls of the pore cavities, and in the smaller crevices and capillaries.

The oil, which occupies 80% of the pore space, is in the most favorable portions of the pore spaces,.

Although it is true that the viscosities, the interfacial tensions, and other factors have some effect on the relative permeability ratio, for a given rock, it is mainly a function of the fluid saturations.

Only water will be produced from a well completed in the true water zone, and only oil will be produced from the true oil zone. In the transition zone (Fig. 10.3), both oil and water will be produced, and the fraction that is water will depend on the oil and water saturations at the point of completion.

The fractional flow in surface flow rate units, or surface watercut,.

Mobility Ratio = Water/Oil.

Heterogeneities and anisotropy, mobility of the displacing fluids compared with the mobility of the displaced fluids, the physical arrangement of injection and production wells, and the type of rock matrix in which the oil or gas exists.

Where such permeability stratification exists, the displacing water sweeps faster through the more permeable zones so that much of the oil in the less permeable zones must be produced over a long period of time at high water-oil ratios. The.

Where such permeability stratification exists, the displacing water sweeps faster through the more permeable zones so that much of the oil in the less permeable zones must be produced over a long period of time at high water-oil ratios.

The movement of fluids through the reservoir will not be uniform if there are large variations in such properties as porosity, permeability, and clay cement.

Mobility is a relative measure of how easily a fluid moves through porous media.

When a fluid is being injected into a porous medium containing both the injected fluid and a second fluid, the apparent mobility of the displacing phase is usually measured at the average displacing phase saturation when the displacing phase just begins to break through at the production site.

A phenomenon called viscous fingering can take place if the mobility of the displacing phase is much greater than the mobility of the displaced phase. Viscous fingering simply refers to the penetration of the much more mobile displacing phase into the phase that is being displaced.

The arrangement of injection and production wells depends primarily on the geology of the formation and the size (areal extent) of the reservoir.

Knowledge of any directional permeability effects and other heterogeneities can aid in the consideration of well arrangements.

Limestone formations are associated with connate water that can have high levels of divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2.

Limestone formations are associated with connate water that can have high levels of divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Vugular porosity and high-divalent ion content in their connate waters hinder the application of injection processes in limestone reservoirs.

Pcow = Po - Pw = Pnm - Pw.

The flowing water-oil ratio at reservoir conditions depends on the viscosity ratio and the effective permeability ratio (i.e., on the mobility ratio),.

Oil is displaced from a rock by water similar to how fluid is displaced from a cylinder by a leaky piston.

Let the total throughput, q′ = qwBw + qoBo, in reservoir barrels be the same at all cross sections.

For the present, we will neglect gravitational and capillary forces that may be acting.

The oil saturation will be slightly higher at the right-hand face, so the fraction of water flowing there will be slightly less, or fw – dfw. Then the rate of water leaving the element is . The net rate of gain of water in the element at any time, then, is.

.

Then if oil is being displaced from the element, at time (t + dt), the water saturation will be (Sw + dSw).

For a given rock, the fraction of water fw is a function only of the water saturation Sw.

This means that the distance a plane of constant saturation, Sw, advances is directly proportional to time and to the value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) at that saturation,.

The value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) may be obtained for any value of water saturation, Sw, by plotting fw from Eq. (10.5) versus Sw and graphically taking the slopes at values of.

The value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) may be obtained for any value of water saturation, Sw, by plotting fw from Eq. (10.5) versus Sw and graphically taking the slopes at values of Sw.

The saturation can be only one value at any place and time. The difficulty is resolved by dropping perpendiculars so that the areas to the right (A) equal the areas to the left (B), as shown in Fig. 10.10.

The area to the right of the flood front in Fig. 10.11 is commonly called the oil bank and the area to the left is sometimes called the drag zone.

Well in this reservoir unit will produce water-free oil until the flood front approaches the well.

Thereafter, in a relatively short period, the watercut will rise sharply and be followed by a relatively long period of production at high, and increasingly higher, watercuts.

When a producing formation consists of two or more rather definite strata, or stringers, of different permeabilities, the rates of advance in the separate strata will be proportional to their permeabilities, and the overall effect will be a combination of several separate displacements, such as described for a single homogeneous stratum.

Due to the high oil-gas viscosity ratios and the high gas-oil relative permeability ratios at low gas saturations, the displacement efficiency by gas is generally much lower than that by water, unless the gas displacement is accompanied by substantial gravitational segregation. This.

Due to the high oil-gas viscosity ratios and the high gas-oil relative permeability ratios at low gas saturations, the displacement efficiency by gas is generally much lower than that by water, unless the gas displacement is accompanied by substantial gravitational segregation.

The effect of gravitational segregation in water-drive oil reservoirs is usually of much less concern because of the higher displacement efficiencies and the lower oil-water density differences, whereas the converse is generally true for gas-oil systems.

One interesting application of gravity segregation is to the recovery of updip or “attic” oil in active water-drive reservoirs possessing good gravity segregation characteristics.

When the structurally highest well(s) has gone to water production, high-pressure gas is injected for a period. This gas migrates updip and displaces the oil downdip, where it may be produced from the same well in which the gas was injected. The injected gas is, of course, unrecoverable.

(1) the water viscosity is of the order of 50 times the gas viscosity and (2) the water occupies the less conductive portions of the pore spaces, whereas the gas occupies the more conductive portions.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, and gravity drainage.

These EOR techniques have been lumped into two categories—secondary and tertiary recovery processes.

Process that is not discussed in this text is the use of pumpjacks at the end of primary.

A process that is not discussed in this text is the use of pumpjacks at the end of primary production. A pumpjack is basically a device used with a downhole pump to help lift oil from the reservoir when the reservoir pressure has been depleted to a point where the oil cannot travel to the surface. Most producing companies will employ this technology, but it is not considered an enhanced oil recovery process.

On the average, primary production methods will produce from a reservoir about 25% to 30% of the initial oil in place. The remaining oil, 70% to 75% of the initial resource, is a large and attractive target for enhanced oil recovery techniques.

Gasflooding has proven very useful with reservoirs with a gas cap and where the hydrocarbon formation has a significant dip structure to it.

Waterflooding recovers oil by the water moving through the reservoir as a bank of fluid and “pushing” oil ahead of.

Waterflooding recovers oil by the water moving through the reservoir as a bank of fluid and “pushing” oil ahead of it.

The recovery efficiency of a waterflood is largely a function of the sweep efficiency of the flood and the ratio of the oil and water viscosities.

Sweep efficiency, as discussed in Chapter 10, is a measure of how well the water has contacted the available pore space in the oil-bearing zone.

Fractures, high-permeability streaks, and faults are examples of gross heterogeneities.

When injected water is much less viscous than the oil it is meant to displace, the water could begin to finger or channel through the reservoir.

This fingering or channeling is referred to as viscous fingering and may lead to significant bypassing of residual oil and lower flooding efficiencies. This bypassing of residual oil is an important issue in applying any enhanced oil recovery technique, including waterflooding.

When gas is the pressure maintenance agent, it is usually injected into a zone of free gas (i.e., a gas cap) to maximize recovery by gravity drainage.

The injected gas is usually produced natural gas from the reservoir in question.

Reservoir characteristics and fluid characteristics.

The main reservoir characteristics that affect a waterflood are depth, structure, homogeneity, and petrophysical properties such as porosity, saturation, and average permeability.

First, investment and operating costs generally increase as the depth increases, as a result of the increase in drilling and lifting costs.

Second, the reservoir must be deep enough for the injection pressure to be less than the fracture pressure of the reservoir.

If the reservoir has a dipped structure, gravity effects can often be used to increase sweep efficiencies.

The average reservoir permeability should be high enough to allow sufficient fluid injection without parting or fracturing the reservoir.

(2) take advantage of the reservoir characteristics, such as dip, faults, fractures, and permeability trends. In.

Pattern flooding is used in reservoirs having a small dip and a large surface.

Pattern flooding is used in reservoirs having a small dip and a large surface area.

The reservoir characteristics yield lower injection rates than those desired, the operator should consider using either a seven- or a nine-spot pattern, where there are more injection wells per pattern than producing wells. A similar argument can be made for using a four-spot pattern in a reservoir with low flow rates in the production wells.

Schematic of an anticlinal reservoir with an underlying aquifer is shown. The injectors are placed so that the injected water either enters the aquifer or is near.

The injectors are placed so that the injected water either enters the aquifer or is near the aquifer-reservoir interface.

These include horizontal wells and injection pressures above the reservoir fracturing pressure.

A successful waterflood in a typical reservoir results in oil recoveries increasing from 25% after primary recovery to 30% to 33% overall.

Since a gas is typically much less viscous than oil, viscous fingering of the gas phase through the oil phase may occur, resulting in poor sweep efficiencies and low oil recoveries.

Tertiary oil recovery refers to the process of producing liquid hydrocarbons by methods other than the conventional use of reservoir.

Tertiary oil recovery refers to the process of producing liquid hydrocarbons by methods other than the conventional use of reservoir energy (primary recovery) and secondary recovery schemes discussed in the last section.

(1) miscible flooding processes, (2) chemical flooding processes, and (3) thermal flooding processes.

Miscible displacement includes single-contact and multiple-contact miscible processes.

Chemical processes are polymer, micellar polymer, alkaline flooding, and microbial flooding.

Thermal processes include hot water, steam cycling, steam drive, and in situ combustion.

In general, thermal processes are applicable in reservoirs containing heavy crude oils, whereas chemical and miscible displacement processes are used in reservoirs containing light crude oils.

The mobilization of oil is governed by the viscous forces (pressure gradients) and the interfacial tension forces that exist in the sand grain–oil–water system.

The capillary number is the ratio of the viscous force to the interfacial tension force.

The capillary number increases as the viscous force increases or as the interfacial tension force decreases.

The correlation suggests that a capillary number greater than 10–5 for the mobilization of unconnected oil droplets is necessary.

The tertiary methods that have been developed and applied to reservoir situations are designed either to increase the viscous force associated with the injected fluid or to decrease the interfacial tension force between the injected fluid and the reservoir oil.

Miscible flooding, chemical flooding, thermal flooding, and microbial flooding.

Microscopic displacement efficiency is largely a function of interfacial forces acting between the oil, rock, and displacing fluid.

The interfacial tension between the trapped oil and displacing fluid could be lowered.

If the interfacial tension between the trapped oil and displacing fluid could be lowered.

The oil droplets could be deformed and squeeze through the pore constrictions.

A miscible process is one in which the interfacial tension is zero—that is, the displacing fluid and residual oil mix to form one phase. If the interfacial tension is zero, then the capillary number NVC becomes infinite and the microscopic displacement efficiency is maximized.

The first type is referred to as the single-contact miscible process and involves such injection fluids.

The first type is referred to as the single-contact miscible process and involves such injection fluids as liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) and alcohols.

The second type is the multiple-contact, or dynamic, miscible process.

The injected fluid and oil are usually not miscible on first contact but rely on a process of chemical exchange of the intermediate hydrocarbons between phases to achieve miscibility.

The injected fluids in this case are usually methane, inert fluids, or an enriched methane gas supplemented with a C2-C6 fraction; this fraction of alkanes has the unique ability to behave like a liquid or a gas at many reservoir conditions.

Gas could be mixed with either a liquid or a vapor in appropriate percentages and yield a miscible system.

However, when liquid is mixed with a vapor, often the result is a composition in the two-phase region.

Saturation has been decreased and exists partly as a continuous phase in some pore channels but as discontinuous droplets in other channels.

The oil exists primarily as a discontinuous phase of droplets or globules that have been isolated and trapped by the displacing brine.

The residual oil exists as a film around the sand grains. In the smaller flow channels, this film may occupy the entire void space.

The waterflooding of oil in an oil-wet system yields a different fluid distribution at Sor. Early in the waterflood, the brine forms continuous flow paths through the center portions of some of the pore channels. The brine enters more and more of the pore channels as the waterflood progresses. At residual oil saturation, the brine has entered a sufficient number of pore channels to shut off the oil flow. The residual oil exists as a film around the sand grains. In the smaller flow channels, this film may occupy the entire void space.

The mobilization of the residual oil saturation in a water-wet system requires that the discontinuous globules be connected to form a continuous flow channel that leads to a producing well.

In an oil-wet porous medium, the film of oil around the sand grains must be displaced to large pore channels and be connected in a continuous phase before it can be mobilized.

There have been several investigations of the effect of viscous forces and interfacial tension forces on the trapping and mobilization of residual oil.

Consider a miscible process with n-decane as the residual oil, propane as fluid A, and methane as fluid B.

The phase behavior of hydrocarbon systems can be described through the use of ternary diagrams.

Crude oil phase behavior can typically be represented reasonably well by three fractions of the crude.

One fraction is methane (C1).

Second fraction is a mixture of ethane through hexane (C2-C6.

The third fraction is the remaining hydrocarbon species lumped together and called C7+.

A gas could be mixed with either a liquid or a vapor in appropriate percentages and yield a miscible system.

Multiple-contact or dynamic miscible processes do not require the oil and displacing fluid to be miscible immediately on contact but rely on chemical exchange between the two phases for miscibility to be achieved.

Chemical flooding processes involve the addition of one or more chemical compounds to an injected fluid either to reduce the interfacial tension between the reservoir oil and injected fluid or to improve the sweep efficiency of the injected fluid by making it more viscous, thereby improving the mobility ratio.

Both mechanisms are designed to increase the capillary number.

The first is polymer flooding, in which a large macromolecule is used to increase the displacing fluid viscosity.

The remaining two methods, micellar-polymer flooding and alkaline flooding, make use of chemicals that reduce the interfacial tension between oil and a displacing fluid.

The addition of large molecular weight molecules called polymers to an injected water can often increase the effectiveness of a conventional waterflood.

In a flooding application, the increased viscosity will alter the mobility ratio between the injected fluid and the reservoir oil.

The improved mobility ratio will lead to better vertical and areal sweep efficiencies and thus higher oil recoveries.

These are synthetically produced polyacrylamides and biologically produced polysaccharides.

Polysaccharides are less susceptible to both mechanical shear and salt. Since they are produced biologically, care must be taken to prevent biological degradation in the reservoir. As a rule, polysaccharides are more expensive than polyacrylamides.

Polymer flooding has not been successful in high-temperature reservoirs. Neither polymer type has exhibited sufficiently long-term stability above 160°F in moderate-salinity or heavy-salinity brines.

Polymer flooding has the best application in moderately heterogeneous reservoirs and reservoirs containing oils with viscosities less than 100 centipoise (cp).

Since the use of polymers does not affect the microscopic displacement efficiency, the improvement in oil recovery will be due to improved sweep efficiency over what is obtained during a conventional waterflood.

The basic micellar-polymer process uses a surfactant to lower the interfacial tension between the injected fluid and the reservoir.

Surfactant is a surface-active agent that contains a hydrophobic (“dislikes” water) part to the molecule and a hydrophilic (“likes” water) part. The surfactant migrates to the interface between the oil and water phases and helps make the two phases more miscible.

When surfactants are mixed above a critical saturation in a water-oil system, the result is a stable mixture called a micellar solution.

(1) phase behavior studies,.

(2) interfacial tension studies,.

(3) oil displacement studies.

When an alkaline solution is mixed with certain crude oils, surfactant molecules are formed.

When the formation of surfactant molecules occurs in situ, the interfacial tension between the brine and oil phases could be reduced.

The reduction of interfacial tension causes the microscopic displacement efficiency to increase, thereby increasing oil recovery.

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) flooding involves the injection of microorganisms that react with reservoir fluids to assist in the production of residual oil.

There are two general types of MEOR processes—those in which microorganisms react with reservoir fluids to generate surfactants or those in which microorganisms react with reservoir fluids to generate polymers.

The success of MEOR processes will be highly dependent on reservoir characteristics.

Most pilot projects have involved an application of the huff and puff or thermal-cycling process discussed with regard to thermal flooding.

When oil is produced during the huff stage, oil from lower permeability zones will be produced.

(1) screening of chemicals to optimize the microscopic displacement efficiency, (2) contacting the oil in the reservoir, and (3) maintaining good mobility in order to lessen the effects of viscous fingering.

The study of the properties of rocks and their relationship to the fluids they contain in both the static and flowing states is called petrophysics.

The symbol N (coming from the Greek word naptha) represents the initial volume of oil in the reservoir expressed as a standard surface volume, such as the stock-tank barrel (STB).

Of course, if the cricondentherm of a fluid is below approximately 50°F, then only gas will exist on the surface at usual ambient temperatures, and the production will be called dry gas. Nevertheless, even dry gas may contain valuable liquid fractions that can be removed by low-temperature separation.

As pressure declines due to production, the composition of the produced fluid will be the same as reservoir A and will remain constant until the dew-point pressure is reached at 2700 psia, point B1. Below this pressure, a liquid condenses out of the reservoir fluid as a fog or dew. This type of reservoir is commonly called a dew-point or a gas-condensate reservoir. This condensation leaves the gas phase with a lower liquid content.

The condensed liquid remains immobile at low concentrations. Thus the gas produced at the surface will have a lower liquid content, and the producing gas-oil ratio therefore rises. This process of retrograde condensation continues until a point of maximum liquid volume is reached, 10% at 2250 psia, point B2. The term retrograde is used because generally vaporization, rather than condensation, occurs during isothermal expansion. After the dew point is reached, because the composition of the produced fluid changes, the composition of the remaining reservoir fluid also changes, and the phase envelope begins to shift.

The overall retrograde loss will evidently be greater (1) for lower reservoir temperatures, (2) for higher abandonment pressures, and (3) for greater shift of the phase diagram to the right—the latter being a property of the hydrocarbon system.

The curves within the two-phase envelope show the percentage of the total hydrocarbon volume that is liquid for any temperature and pressure.

Although the fluid left in the reservoir remains in one phase, the fluid produced through the wellbore and into surface separators, although the same composition, may enter the two-phase region owing to the temperature decline, as along line.

This accounts for the production of condensate liquid at the surface from a single-phase gas phase in the reservoir.

Finally, if the initial hydrocarbon mixture occurred at 2000 psia and 150°F, point D, it would be a two-phase reservoir, consisting of a liquid or oil zone overlain by a gas zone or cap.

The liquid or oil zone will be at its bubble point and will be produced as a bubble-point reservoir modified by the presence of the gas cap.

The gas cap will be at the dew point and may be either retrograde, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a), or nonretrograde, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b.

From this technical point of view, hydrocarbon reservoirs are initially either in a single-phase state (A, B, or C) or in a two-phase state (D), depending on their temperatures and pressures relative to their phase envelopes.

Production with gas-oil ratios greater than 100,000 SCF/STB is commonly called lean or dry gas, although there is no generally recognized dividing line between the two categories.

The term wet gas is sometimes used interchangeably with gas condensate.

Although there is good correlation between the molecular weight of the heptanes plus and the gravity of the stock-tank liquid, there is virtually no correlation between the gas-oil ratios and the gravities of the stock-tank liquids, except that most black oil reservoirs have gas-oil ratios below 1000 SCF/STB and stock-tank liquid gravities below 45 °API.

The gas-oil ratios are a good indication of the overall composition of the fluid, high gas-oil ratios being associated with low concentrations of pentanes and heavier and vice versa.

That something could be the swelling of the remaining hydrocarbon due to a drop in reservoir pressure, the encroachment of water from a neighboring aquifer, or the expansion of formation.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, gravity drainage, and formation expansion. When.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, gravity drainage, and formation expansion.

When there is water influx from the aquifer and the reservoir pressure remains near the initial reservoir pressure, recovery is accomplished by a displacement mechanism, which again may be aided by gravitational drainage.

The recovery efficiency of a waterflood is largely a function of the macroscopic sweep efficiency of the flood and the microscopic pore scale displacement behavior that is largely governed by the ratio of the oil and water viscosities.

For most reservoirs, it is advantageous to begin a secondary or a tertiary process before primary production is completed.

For these reservoirs, the term enhanced oil recovery was introduced and has become popular in reference to any recovery process that, in general, improves the recovery over what the natural reservoir energy would be expected to yield.

Porosity values range from 10% to 40% for sandstone type reservoirs and 5% to 15% for limestone type reservoirs.

The total porosity represents the total void space of the medium. The effective porosity is the amount of the void space that contributes to the flow of fluids.

The average porosity is seldom known more precisely than to 1% porosity (e.g., to 5% accuracy at 20% porosity). The porosity is also calculated from indirect methods using well log data, often with the assistance of some core measurements.

Logging techniques have the advantage of averaging larger volumes of rock than in core analysis.

The equation describes the change in volume that a substance undergoes during a change in pressure while the temperature is held constant.

When the internal fluid pressure within the pore spaces of a rock,.

Is reduced, the bulk volume of the rock decreases while the volume of the solid rock material (e.g., the sand grains of a sandstone) increases.

Change in porosity for a given rock depends only on the difference between the internal and external pressures and not on the absolute value of the pressures.

Change in pore volume is nonlinear and the pore volume compressibility is not constant.

The values for limestone and sandstone reservoir rocks lie in the range of 2 × 10–6 to 25 × 10–6 psi.

The direct approach involves either the extraction of the reservoir fluids or the leaching of the fluids from a sample of the reservoir rock.

The indirect approach relies on a measurement of some other property, such as capillary pressure, and the derivation of a mathematical relationship between the measured property and saturation.

Direct methods include retorting the fluids from the rock, distilling the fluids with a modified American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedure, and centrifuging the fluids.

Each method relies on some procedure to remove the rock sample from the reservoir.

The indirect methods use logging or capillary pressure measurements.

The petroleum industry works with a set of standard conditions—usually 14.7 psia and 60°F.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF. A quantity of a pure gas can be expressed as the number.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF. A.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF.

Because it is more convenient to measure the specific gravity of gases than the gas density, specific gravity is more commonly used.

Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the density of a gas at a given temperature and pressure to the density of air at the same temperature and pressure, usually near 60°F and atmospheric pressure.

Whereas the density of gases varies with temperature and pressure, the specific gravity is independent of temperature and pressure when the gas obeys the ideal gas law.

All molecules of real gases have two tendencies: (1) to fly apart from each other because of their constant kinetic motion and (2) to come together because of electrical attractive forces between the molecules.

When the volume of a gas will be less than what the ideal gas volume would be, the gas is said to be supercompressible.

The number, which measures the gas’s deviation from perfect behavior, is sometimes called the supercompressibility factor, usually shortened to the gas compressibility factor.

This dimensionless quantity usually varies between 0.70 and 1.20, with a value of 1.00 representing ideal behavior.

At very high pressures, above about 5000 psia, natural gases pass from a supercompressible condition to one in which compression is more difficult than in the ideal gas.

Definition the ratio of the volume actually occupied by a gas at a given pressure and temperature to the volume it would occupy if it behaved ideally,.

Without a bottom-hole fluid sample, produced wet gas or gas condensate may be recombined at the surface. This may be accomplished by recombining samples of separator gas, stock-tank gas, and stock-tank liquid in the proportions in which they are produced.

For wet gas or gas condensate, the deviation factor may be measured for differentially liberated gas below the dew-point pressure.

For reservoir oil, the deviation factor of solution gas is measured on gas samples evolved from solution in the oil during a differential liberation process.

The gas deviation factor is commonly determined by measuring the volume of a sample at desired pressures and temperatures and then measuring the volume of the same mass of gas at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature sufficiently high so that all the material remains in the vapor phase.

If the gas deviation factor is not measured, it may be estimated from its specific gravity.

The gas formation volume factor (Bg) relates the volume of gas in the reservoir to the volume on the surface (i.e., at standard conditions psc and Tsc.

These gas volume factors mean that 1 std ft3 (at 14.7 psia and 60°F) will occupy 0.00533 ft3 of space in the reservoir at 3250 psia and 213°F.

Sometimes it is useful to introduce the concept of gas compressibility. This must not be confused with the gas deviation factor, which is also referred to as the gas compressibility factor.

The change in volume with pressure for gases under isothermal conditions, which is closely realized in reservoir gas flow,.

For an ideal gas, z = 1.00 and dz/dp = 0, and the compressibility is simply the reciprocal of the pressure.

An ideal gas at 1000 psia, then, has a compressibility of 1/1000 or 1000 × 10–6 psi.

The viscosity of natural gas depends on the temperature, pressure, and composition of the gas.

Is not commonly measured in the laboratory because it can be estimated with good precision.

It is not commonly measured in the laboratory because it can be estimated with good precision.

Carr, Kobayashi, and Burrows have developed correlation charts, Figs. 2.6 and 2.7, for estimating the viscosity of natural gas from the pseudoreduced temperature and pressure.

There are two main reasons for the oil correlations being less reliable. The first is that oils usually consist of many more components than gases. Whereas gases are mostly made up of alkanes, oils can be made up of several different classes of compounds (e.g., aromatics and paraffins). The second reason is that mixtures of liquid components exhibit more nonidealities than mixtures of gas components. These nonidealities can lead to errors in extrapolating correlations that have been developed for a certain database of samples to particular applications outside the database.

The amount of gas dissolved in an oil at a given pressure and temperature is referred to as the solution gas-oil ratio (Rso), in units of SCF/STB.

Unlike the solubility of, say, sodium chloride in water, gas is infinitely soluble in crude oil, the quantity being limited only by the pressure or by the quantity of gas available.

Crude oil is said to be saturated with gas at any pressure and temperature if, on a slight reduction in pressure, some gas is released from the solution.

Conversely, if no gas is released from the solution, the crude oil is said to be undersaturated at that pressure.

The undersaturated state implies that there is a deficiency of gas present and that, had there been an abundance of gas present, the oil would be saturated at that pressure. The undersaturated state further implies that there is no free gas in contact with the crude oil (i.e., there is no gas cap).

Will be shown that the reservoir volume of crude oil increases appreciably because of the solution gas, and for this reason, the quantity of solution gas is usually referenced to a unit of stock-tank oil and the solution gas-oil ratio (Rso) is expressed in standard cubic feet per stock-tank barrel.

The graph indicates that no gas is evolved from the solution when the pressure drops from the initial pressure to 2500 psia. Thus the oil is undersaturated in this region, and there can be no free gas phase (gas cap) in the reservoir.

Solution gas-oil ratio and other fluid properties depend on the manner by which the gas is liberated from the oil.

One obvious implication of the formation volume factor is that for every 1.310 bbl of reservoir liquid in the Big Sandy reservoir, only 1.000 bbl, or 76.3%, can reach the stock tank.

This figure (76.3% or 0.763) is the reciprocal of the formation volume factor and is called the shrinkage factor. Just as the formation volume factor is multiplied by the stock-tank volume to find the reservoir volume, the shrinkage factor is multiplied by the reservoir volume to find the stock-tank volume.

The formation volume factors depend on the type of gas liberation process—.

It is convenient to use the term two-phase formation volume factor (Bt), which is defined as the volume in barrels one stock-tank barrel and its initial complement of dissolved gas occupies at any pressure and reservoir temperature.

In other words, it includes the liquid volume, Bo, plus the volume of the difference between the initial solution gas-oil ratio, Rsoi, and the solution gas-oil ratio at the specified pressure, Rso.

Above the bubble point, pressure Rsoi = Rso and the single-phase and two-phase factors are equal. Below the bubble point,.

Is commonly reported for reference to the smaller volume—that is, the volume at the higher pressure.

It is commonly reported for reference to the smaller volume—that is, the volume at the higher pressure.

Below the bubble point, the viscosity decreases with increasing pressure owing to the thinning effect of gas entering solution, but above the bubble point, the viscosity increases with increasing pressure. Figure 2.11 The viscosity of four crude oil samples.

Below the bubble point, the viscosity decreases with increasing pressure owing to the thinning effect of gas entering solution, but above the bubble point, the viscosity increases with increasing pressure.

When it is necessary to estimate the viscosity of reservoir oils, correlations have been developed for both above and below the bubble-point pressure.

The correlation is for what is referred to as “dead” oil, which simply means it does not contain solution gas.

The viscosity of water increases with decreasing temperature and in general with increasing pressure and salinity.

Water and formation compressibilities are generally neglected, except in undersaturated reservoirs producing above the bubble point. A term accounting for the change in water and formation.

Water and formation compressibilities are generally neglected, except in undersaturated reservoirs producing above the bubble point.

The general material balance equation is simply a volumetric balance, which states that since the volume of a reservoir (as defined by its initial limits) is a constant, the algebraic sum of the volume changes of the oil, free gas, water, and rock volumes in the reservoir must be zero.

In making these calculations, the following production, reservoir, and laboratory data are involved:.

The initial reservoir pressure and the average reservoir pressure at successive intervals after the start of production.

The stock-tank barrels of oil produced, measured at 1 atm and 60°F, at any time or during any production interval.

The total standard cubic feet of gas produced. When gas is injected into the reservoir, this will be the difference between the total gas produced and that returned to the reservoir.

The ratio of the initial gas cap volume and the initial oil volume, m:.

The value of m can be determined with reasonable precision, there is only one unknown (N) in the material balance on volumetric gas cap reservoirs and two (N and We) in water-drive reservoirs.

If the value of m can be determined with reasonable precision, there is only one unknown (N) in the material balance on volumetric gas cap reservoirs and two (N and We) in water-drive reservoirs.

The value of m is determined from log and core data and from well completion data, which frequently helps to locate the gas-oil and water-oil contacts.

The ratio m is known in many instances much more accurately than the absolute values of the gas cap and oil zone volumes.

The gas and oil formation volume factors and the solution gas-oil ratios. These are obtained as functions of pressure by laboratory measurements on bottom-hole samples by the differential and flash liberation methods.

The quantity of water that has been produced.

The quantity of water that has been encroached into the reservoir from the aquifer.

Oil expansion is derived from the product of the initial oil in place and the change in the two-phase oil formation volume factor.

Gas expansion is similar; however, additional terms are needed to convert the initial oil in place to initial gas in place—both free gas and dissolved gas.

Determining the initial hydrocarbon in place.

Calculating water influx.

Predicting reservoir pressures.

One of the most important uses of the equations is predicting the effect of cumulative production and/or injection (gas or water) on reservoir pressure; therefore, it is very desirable to know in advance the initial oil and the ratio m from good core and log data.

Unless other complicating factors are present, the constancy in the calculated value of N and/or G indicates a volumetric reservoir, and continually changing values of N and G indicate a water drive.

Wieland and Kennedy have found a tendency for the liquid phase to remain supersaturated with gas as the pressure declines.

The effect of supersaturation causes reservoir pressure for a given volume of production to be lower than it otherwise would have been, had equilibrium been attained.

Another source of error is introduced in the determination of average reservoir pressure at the end of any production interval.

For thicker formations with higher permeabilities and oils of lower viscosities, where final buildup pressures are readily and accurately obtained and when there are only small pressure differences across the reservoir, reliable values of average reservoir pressure are easily obtained.

On the other hand, for thinner formations of lower permeability and oils of higher viscosity, difficulties are met in obtaining accurate final buildup pressures, and there are often large pressure variations throughout the reservoir.

These are commonly averaged by preparing isobaric maps superimposed on isopach maps.

Also, difficulties are encountered when production from two or more vertically isolated zones or strata of different productivity are commingled. In this case, the pressures are generally higher in the strata of low productivity, and because the measured pressures are nearer to those in the zones of high productivity, the measured static pressures tend to be lower and the reservoir behaves as if it contained less oil.

The effect of pressure errors on calculated values of initial oil or water influx depends on the size of the errors in relation to the reservoir pressure decline.

Because water influx and gas cap expansion tend to offset pressure decline, the pressure errors are more serious than for the undersaturated depletion reservoirs.

In the case of very active water drives and gas caps that are large compared with the associated oil zone, the material balance is useless to determine the initial oil in place because of the very small pressure decline.

Uncertainties in the ratio of the initial free gas volume to the initial reservoir oil volume also affect the calculations.

Larger gas caps reduce the effect of pressure decline. For quite large gas caps relative to the oil zone, the material balance approaches a gas balance modified slightly by production from the oil zone.

Well tests are often useful in locating gas-oil and water-oil contacts in the determination of m.

When two or more wells completed in different reservoirs are producing to common storage, unless there are individual meters on the wells, only the aggregate production is known and not the individual oil production from each reservoir.

Normally, when using the material balance equation, an engineer considers each pressure and the corresponding production data as being separate points from other pressure values. From each separate point, a calculation for a dependent variable is made. The results of the calculations are sometimes averaged. The Havlena-Odeh method uses all the data points, with the further requirement that these points must yield solutions to the material balance equation that behave linearly to obtain values of the independent variable.

The tendency for condensate to form on the surface increases as the concentration of heavier components increases in the reservoir fluid.

This unit recovery is the difference between the initial gas in place and the gas remaining in the reservoir at the time of abandonment and represents the total gas that can be produced from the reservoir.

Two main mechanisms in gas reservoirs will be discussed in this chapter. They are gas drive, which is the expansion of the gas in the reservoir due to a drop in reservoir pressure as gas is being produced, and water drive, which is the encroachment of water in the reservoir due to contact with an aquifer.

In the case of a gas drive, there is neither water encroachment into nor water production from the reservoir of interest, and the reservoir is said to be volumetric.

A subsurface contour map shows lines connecting points of equal elevations on the top of a marker bed and therefore shows geologic structure.

Net isopach map shows lines connecting points of equal net formation thickness, and the individual lines connecting points of equal thickness are called isopach lines.

A net isopach map shows lines connecting points of equal net formation thickness, and the individual lines connecting points of equal thickness are called isopach lines.

The contact line is the zero isopach line.

The volume is obtained by planimetering the areas between the isopach lines of the entire reservoir or of the individual units under consideration.

The standard cubic feet of gas in a reservoir with a gas pore volume of Vg ft3 is simply Vg/Bg.

Since obtaining the average pressure of the hydrocarbon contents is the important piece of data, the volumetric average, Eq. (4.4), should be used in the calculations for bulk hydrocarbon volume. Where the pressure gradients in the reservoir are small, the average pressures obtained with Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) will be very close to the volumetric average.

Since obtaining the average pressure of the hydrocarbon contents is the important piece of data, the volumetric average, Eq. (4.4), should be used in the calculations for bulk hydrocarbon volume. Where the pressure gradients in the reservoir are small, the average pressures obtained with Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) will be very close to the volumetric average. Where the gradients are large, there may be considerable differences.

For a reservoir under volumetric control, there is no change in the interstitial water,.

For a reservoir under volumetric control, there is no change in the interstitial water, so the reservoir gas volume remains the same.

Some gas pipeline companies use an abandonment pressure of 100 psi per 1000 ft of depth.

The water drive is very active and, as a result, there is essentially no decline in reservoir pressure, unit recovery and the recovery factor become.

Because the residual gas saturation is independent of the pressure, the recovery will be greater for the lower stabilization pressure.

The residual gas saturation can be measured in the laboratory on representative core samples.

In calculating the gas reserve of a particular lease or unit, the gas that can be recovered by the well(s) on the lease is important rather than the total recoverable gas initially underlying the lease, some of which may be recovered by adjacent wells. In volumetric reservoirs where the recoverable gas.

In calculating the gas reserve of a particular lease or unit, the gas that can be recovered by the well(s) on the lease is important rather than the total recoverable gas initially underlying the lease, some of which may be recovered by adjacent wells.

In volumetric reservoirs where the recoverable gas beneath each lease (well) is the same, the recoveries will be the same only if all wells are produced at the same rate.

On the other hand, if wells are produced at equal rates when the gas beneath the leases (wells) varies, as from variable formation thickness, the calculated initial gas reserve of the lease, where the formation is thicker, will be less than the initial actual recoverable gas underlying the lease.

For most gas reservoirs, the gas compressibility term is much greater than the formation and water compressibilities, and the second term on the left-hand side of Eq. (3.10) becomes negligible:.

When reservoir pressures are abnormally high, this term is not negligible and should not be ignored. This situation is discussed in a later section of this chapter.

Because of the water influx, the pressure drops less rapidly with production than under volumetric control, as.

Also, where there is water influx, the initial gas in place calculated at successive stages of depletion, assuming no water influx, takes on successively higher values, whereas with volumetric reservoirs the calculated values of the initial gas should remain substantially constant.

The produced hydrocarbon liquid is converted to its gas equivalent, assuming it behaves as an ideal gas when vaporized in the produced gas.

When water is produced on the surface as a condensate from the gas phase in the reservoir, it is freshwater and should be converted to a gas equivalent and added to the gas production.

It would appear that any freshwater produced in excess of the initial content should be treated as produced water and taken care of in the Wp term rather than the Gp term.

Since this additional content has come from vaporization of the connate water, it would appear that any freshwater produced in excess of the initial content should be treated as produced water and taken care of in the Wp term rather than the Gp term.

(1) verification of inventory, (2) retention against migration, and (3) assurance of deliverability.

Verification of inventory simply means knowing the storage capacity of the reservoir as a function of pressure. This suggests that a p/z plot or some other measure of material balance be known for the reservoir of interest.

Retention against migration refers to a monitoring system capable of ascertaining if the injected gas remains in the storage reservoir.

Normal pressure gradients observed in gas reservoirs are in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 psi per foot of depth. Reservoirs with abnormal pressures may have gradients as high as 0.7 to 1.0 psi per foot of depth.

When the water and formation compressibility term in the material balance equation can be ignored, the normal p/z behavior for a volumetric gas reservoir plots a straight line versus cumulative gas produced (Fig. 4.2).

This is not the case for an abnormally pressured gas reservoir, as can be seen in Fig. 4.6, which illustrates the p/z behavior for this type of reservoir.

For an abnormally pressured volumetric reservoir, the p/z plot is a straight line during the early life of production, but then it usually curves downward during the later stages of production.

The early data are used to extrapolate for G or for an abandonment Gp, the extrapolation can yield significant errors.

“rock collapse” theory that used a high rock compressibility at abnormally high pressures and a reduced rock compressibility at normal reservoir pressures.

Bernard has proposed a method of analyzing the p/z curve for abnormally pressured reservoirs to determine initial gas in place and gas reserve as a function of abandonment p/z.

The apparent gas in place is obtained by extrapolating the early, linear p/z data.

The error in gas production Gp arises from error in gas metering, in the estimate of lease use and leakage, and in the estimate of the low-pressure separator or stock-tank gases.

The precision of the initial gas in place depends on the probable errors in the averages of the porosity, connate water, pressure, and gas deviation factor and in the error in the determination of the bulk productive volume.

The reserve is the product of the gas in place and the recovery factor.

When the reservoir exhibits permeability stratification, the difficulties are increased and the accuracy is therefore reduced.

In general, reserve calculations are more accurate for volumetric than for water-drive reservoirs.

Sometimes underground leakage occurs—from the failure in casing cementing, from casing corrosion, or, in the case of dual completions, from leakage between the two zones.

Pressure errors are a result of gauge errors and the difficulties in averaging, particularly when there are large pressure differences throughout the reservoir.

Water production with gas wells is frequently unreported when the amount is small; when it is appreciable, it is often estimated from periodic well tests.

Gas-condensate production is predominantly gas from which more or less liquid is condensed in the surface separators—hence the name gas condensate.

Gas-condensate reservoirs may be approximately defined as those that produce light-colored or colorless stock-tank liquids with gravities above 45 °API at gas-oil ratios in the range of 5000 to 100,000 SCF/STB.

Oil discoveries predominated at depths less than 8000 ft, but gas and gas-condensate discoveries predominated below 10,000 ft.

For example, in a single-phase gas reservoir, reducing the reservoir pressure increases the recovery factor, and a water drive is likely to reduce the recovery factor.

In a gas-condensate reservoir, reducing the reservoir pressure below the dew-point pressure reduces condensate recovery, and therefore a water drive that maintains the reservoir pressure above the dew-point pressure will likely increase condensate recovery.

In particular, injecting water maintains pressure and displaces oil toward producing wells, but for condensate, it is better to use gas as a pressure maintenance and displacement fluid.

Since 1.20 bbl of separator liquid shrinks to 1.00 bbl in the stock tank.

When the reservoir temperature is below the cricondentherm, however, a liquid phase develops within the reservoir when pressure declines below the dew point, owing to retrograde condensation, and the treatment is considerably more complex, even for volumetric reservoirs.

The retrograde condensate liquid that forms is trapped as an immobile liquid phase within the pore spaces of the reservoir.

The oil phase is essentially immobile until it builds up to a saturation in the range of 10% to 20% of the pore space,.

In the vicinity of the wellbore, retrograde liquid saturations often build up to higher values so that there is two-phase flow, both gas and retrograde liquid.

(1) reduce, sometimes seriously, the flow rate of gas-condensate wells and (2) affect the accuracy of well samples taken, assuming one-phase flow into the wellbore.

Liquid recovery of the pentanes-plus is somewhat greater in gasoline plants than in field separation and much greater for the propanes and butanes, commonly called liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

The volumetric depletion performance of a retrograde condensate fluid, such as given in Example 5.3, may also be calculated from the initial composition of the single-phase reservoir fluid, using equilibrium ratios. An equilibrium ratio (K) is the ratio of the mole fraction (y) of any component in the vapor phase to the mole fraction (x) of the same component in the liquid phase, or K = y/x. These ratios depend on the temperature and pressure and, unfortunately, on the composition of the system.

The laboratory test on the retrograde condensate fluid in Example 5.3 is itself a material balance study of the volumetric performance of the reservoir from which the sample was taken.

Because the liquid content of many condensate reservoirs is a valuable and important part of the accumulation and because through retrograde condensation a large fraction of this liquid may be left in the reservoir at abandonment, the practice of lean gas cycling has been adopted in many condensate reservoirs.

In gas cycling, the condensate liquid is removed from the produced (wet) gas, usually in a gasoline plant, and the residue, or dry gas, is returned to the reservoir through injection wells.

When dry gas displaces wet gas within the pores of the reservoir rock, the microscopic displacement efficiency is in the range of 70% to 90%.

(1) the composition of the hydrocarbon accumulation and (2) the temperature and pressure of the accumulation in the Earth.

The initial gas and oil (condensate) for gas-condensate reservoirs, both retrograde and nonretrograde, may be calculated from generally available field data by recombining the produced gas and oil in the correct ratio to find the average specific gravity (air = 1.00) of the total well fluid, which is presumably being produced initially from a one-phase reservoir.

The composition of the total well fluid is calculated from the analyses of the produced gas(es) and liquid by recombining them in the ratio in which they are produced.

The liquid recovery is lower for the greater retrograde condensation because the retrograde liquid is generally immobile and is trapped together with some gas behind the invading waterfront.

First, there is the deferred income from the sale of the gas, which may not be produced for 10 to 20 years. Second, cycling requires additional expenditures, usually some more wells, a gas compression and distribution system to the injection wells, and a liquid recovery plant. Third, it must be realized that even when reservoir pressure is maintained above the dew point, the liquid recovery by cycling may be considerably less than 100%.

Cycling is also adopted in nonretrograde gas caps overlying oil zones, particularly when the oil is itself underlain by an active body of water. If the gas cap is produced concurrently with the oil, as the water drives the oil zone into the shrinking gas cap zone, unrecoverable oil remains not only in the original oil zone but also in that portion of the gas cap invaded by the oil.

One of the major disadvantages associated with the use of lean gas in gas-cycling applications is that the income that would be derived from the sale of the lean gas is deferred for several years.

Researchers have found that mixing nitrogen and a typical wet gas causes the dew point of the resulting mixture to be higher than the dew point of the original.

If, in a reservoir situation, the reservoir pressure is not maintained higher than this new dew point, then retrograde condensation will occur. This condensation may be as much or more than what would occur if the reservoir was not cycled with gas.

Mixing occurs as a result of molecular diffusion and dispersion forces, and the resulting mixing zone width is usually only a few feet.

Several methods are available for collecting samples of reservoir fluids. The samples may be taken with subsurface sampling equipment lowered into the well on a wire line, or samples of the gas and oil may be collected at the surface and later recombined in proportion to the gas-oil ratio measured at the time of sampling.

(2) correlations based on statistical studies of particular types of reservoir mechanisms.

For oil reservoirs under volumetric control, there is no water influx to replace the produced oil, so it must be replaced by the swelling of the oil phase or expanding gas, the saturation of which increases as the oil saturation decreases.

The total free gas saturation to be expected at abandonment can be estimated from the oil and water saturations as reported in core analysis.

The final gas saturation in most of these reservoirs ranged from 20% to 40% of the pore space, with an average saturation of 30.4%.

Since it was assumed that the reservoir pressure was maintained at its initial value by the water influx, no free gas saturation develops in the oil zone, and the oil volume factor at abandonment remains Boi. The.

The net cumulative produced gas-oil ratio (Rp) is the quotient of all the gas produced from the reservoir (Gp) and all the oil produced (Np). In some reservoirs, some of the produced gas is returned to the same reservoir, so that the net produced gas is only that which is not returned to the reservoir. When all the produced gas is returned to the reservoir, Rp is.

In some reservoirs, some of the produced gas is returned to the same reservoir, so that the net produced gas is only that which is not returned to the reservoir. When all the produced gas is returned to the reservoir, Rp is zero.

The reservoir was undersaturated, so the recovery from initial pressure to bubble-point pressure is by liquid expansion and the fractional recovery at the bubble point is.

As long as this gas phase remains immobile, it can neither flow to the wellbores nor migrate upward to develop a gas cap but must remain distributed throughout the reservoir, increasing in size as the pressure declines. Because pressure changes much less rapidly with reservoir voidage for gases than for liquids, the reservoir pressure declines at a much lower rate below the bubble point.

(1) water injection into wells located along the longitudinal axis of the field and (2) shutting in the high gas-oil ratio wells and transferring their allowables to low gas-oil ratio wells. The high-ratio wells were shut in as soon as the field was unitized, and water injection was started in 1954. The operation has gone as planned, and approximately 50% of the initial oil in place has been recovered, in contrast to approximately 25% by primary depletion, an increase of approximately 600 MM STB of recoverable oil.

Above the bubble point, the reservoir is produced by liquid expansion, and there is a rapid decline in reservoir pressure that accompanies the recovery of a fraction of 1% to a few percentage points of the initial oil in place.

The gas-oil ratios remain low and generally near the value of the initial solution gas-oil ratio.

Below the bubble point, a gas phase develops that, in most cases, is immobile until the gas saturation reaches the critical gas saturation in the range of a few percentage points to 20%. During this period, the reservoir produces by gas expansion, which is characterized by a much slower decline in pressure and gas-oil ratios near or in some cases even below the initial solution gas-oil ratio. After.

Below the bubble point, a gas phase develops that, in most cases, is immobile until the gas saturation reaches the critical gas saturation in the range of a few percentage points to 20%. During this period, the reservoir produces by gas expansion, which is characterized by a much slower decline in pressure and gas-oil ratios near or in some cases even below the initial solution gas-oil ratio. After the critical gas saturation is reached, free gas begins to flow.

Many unsuccessful attempts were made to decrease the gas-oil ratios by shutting in the wells, by blanking off upper portions of the formation in producing wells, and by perforating only the lowest sand members.

The failure to reduce the gas-oil ratios is typical of the dissolved gas-drive mechanism, because when the critical gas saturation is reached, the gas-oil ratio is a function of the decline in reservoir pressure or depletion and is not materially changed by production rate or completion methods.

The initial gas-oil ratio of a properly completed well in either a dissolved gas drive, gas cap drive, or water-drive reservoir is usually a reliable value to use for the initial solution gas-oil ratio of the reservoir.

The term volumetric, however, is retained to indicate those reservoirs in which there is no water influx but in which volumes change slightly with pressure, due to the effects just mentioned.

Rp = Rsoi above the bubble point,.

As can be seen from the example calculations, the inclusion of the compressibility terms significantly affects the value of N. This is true above the bubble point where the oil-producing mechanism is depletion, or the swelling of reservoir fluids. After the bubble point is reached, the water and rock compressibilities have a much smaller effect on the calculations because the gas compressibility is so much greater.

When there is an initial gas cap (i.e., the oil is initially saturated), there is negligible liquid expansion energy.

(1) pronounced structure, (2) low oil viscosity, (3) high permeability, and (4) low oil velocities.

The most common source of water drive is a result of expansion of the water and the compressibility of the rock in the aquifer; however, it may result from artesian flow.

For heavy crudes whose dissolved gases are almost entirely methane and ethane, the manner of separation is relatively unimportant.

For lighter crudes and heavier gases (i.e., for reservoir fluids with larger fractions of the intermediate hydrocarbons—mainly propane, butanes, and pentanes), the manner of separation raises some important questions.

The flash liberation process, all the gas evolved during a reduction in pressure remains in contact and presumably in equilibrium with the liquid phase from which it is liberated.

The differential process, on the other hand, the gas evolved during a pressure reduction is removed from contact with the liquid phase as rapidly as it is liberated.

(1) the specific volume of the bubble-point oil, (2) the thermal expansion of the saturated oil, and (3) the compressibility of the reservoir fluid at or above the bubble point.

If all gas in reservoirs was methane and all oil was decane and heavier, the PVT properties of the reservoir fluids would be quite simple because the quantities of oil and gas obtained from a mixture of the two would be almost independent of the temperatures,.

The volatility is higher because of the higher reservoir temperatures at depth, approaching 500°F in some cases, and also because of the composition of the fluids, which are high in propane through decane.

The volatile oil reservoir is recognized as a type intermediate in volatility between the moderately volatile reservoir and the gas-condensate reservoir.

A typical laboratory method of estimating the recovery from volatile reservoirs is as follows. Samples of primary separator gas and liquid are obtained and analyzed for composition. With these compositions and a knowledge of separator gas and oil flow rates, the reservoir fluid composition can be calculated. Also, by recombining the separator fluids in the appropriate ratio, a reservoir fluid sample can be obtained. This reservoir fluid sample is placed in a PVT cell and brought to reservoir temperature and pressure. At this point, several tests are conducted. A constant composition expansion is performed to determine relative volume data. These data are the flash liberation volume data listed in Table 7.3. On a separate reservoir sample, a constant volume expansion is performed while the volumes and compositions of the produced phases are monitored. The produced phases are passed through a separator system that simulates the surface facilities. By expanding the original reservoir fluid from the initial reservoir pressure down to an abandonment pressure, the actual production process from the reservoir is simulated. Using the data from the laboratory expansion, the field production can be estimated with a procedure similar to the one used in Example 5.3 to predict performance from a gas-condensate reservoir.

Many studies indicate that the recovery from true solution gas-drive reservoirs by primary depletion is essentially in <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>.

# Man's Search for Meaning (Viktor Frankl)

“He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.”.

This book is less about his travails, what he suffered and lost, than it is about the sources of his strength to survive.

Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life.

Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during diffcult times.

Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.

“may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.”.

Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.

You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.

The man, whose self-esteem had always depended on the respect of others, is emotionally destroyed.

We are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose how we will respond.

Whether it was a family milestone they wanted to live long enough to share or the prospect of doctors finding a cure by studying their illness, having a Why to live for enabled them to bear the How. And my own experience echoes Frankl’s.

Whether it was a family milestone they wanted to live long enough to share or the prospect of doctors finding a cure by studying their illness, having a Why to live.

Whether it was a family milestone they wanted to live long enough to share or the prospect of doctors finding a cure by studying their illness, having a Why to live for enabled them to bear the How.

We have come to know Man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips. HAROLD S. KUSHNER.

“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.

For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run—in the long run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.”.

For the war gave us the war of nerves and it gave us the concentration camp.

When we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned.

Nearly everyone in our transport lived under the illusion that he would be reprieved, that everything would yet be well.

“There are things which must cause you to lose your reason or you have none to lose.”.

I spent some time.

Strangely enough, a blow which does not even find its mark can, under certain circumstances, hurt more than one that finds its mark.

Indignation.

Prisoner—indignation not about cruelty or pain, but about the insult connected with it.

Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.

The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.

A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.

Human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I.

The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood.

The salvation of man is through love and in love.

How a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.

“The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.”.

I have learned well by now: Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self.

I did not know whether my wife was alive, and I had no means of finding out (during all my prison life there was no outgoing or incoming mail); but at that moment it ceased to matter. There was no need for me to know; nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts, and the image of my beloved. Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I would still have given myself, undisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation of her image, and that my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying.

“Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death.”.

When given free rein, his imagination played with past events, of- ten not important ones, but minor happenings and trifling things.

The dawn was grey around us; grey was the sky above; grey the snow in the pale light of dawn; grey the rags in which my fellow prisoners were clad, and grey their faces.

A man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative. It also follows that a very trifling thing.

Not even a boxer who has heard the bell signifying the finish of a round and who is thus saved at the last minute from the danger of a knockout.

No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

Man counted only because he had a prison number. One literally became a number: dead or alive—that was unimportant; the life of a “number” was completely irrelevant.

An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature.

If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.

If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death.

Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.

Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and hope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect.

That it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.

We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly.

Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man, and from moment to moment. Thus it is impossible to define the meaning of life in a general way. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. “Life” does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response. Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way. Sometimes man may be required simply to accept fate, to bear his cross. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to.

(How much suffering there is to get through!). Rilke spoke of “getting through suffering”.

(How much suffering there is to get through!). Rilke spoke of “getting through suffering” as others would talk of “getting through work.”.

There was plenty of suffering for us to get through. Therefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering, trying to keep moments of weakness and furtive tears to a minimum. But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer. Only very few realized that. Shamefacedly some confessed occasionally that they had wept, like the comrade who answered my question of how he had gotten over his edema, by confessing, “I have wept it out of my system.”.

When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”.

The right example was more effective than words could ever be.

Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future.

Will to pleasure).

Will to power.

Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a “secondary rationalization” of instinctual drives.

This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning.

Asked what they considered “very important” to them now, 16 percent of the students checked “making a lot of money”; 78 percent said their first goal was “finding a purpose and meaning to my life.”.

The term “existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to (1) existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3) the striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning.

A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It may well be that interpreting the first in.

A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease.

There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life.

“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”.

In the Nazi concentration camps, one could have witnessed that those who knew that there was a task waiting for them to fulfill were most apt to survive.

At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal’s behavior is imbedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like Paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).

The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. Now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time.

Can observe in such cases that the sexual libido.

One should not search for an abstract meaning of life.

Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment.

Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.

As each situation in life represents a challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed.

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.

Each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.

Categorical imperative.

“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!”.

Seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second,.

It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.

To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is.

To put it figuratively, the role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist’s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.

It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self- transcendence.

Meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three dif- ferent ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The first, the way of achievement or accomplishment, is quite obvious. The second and third need further elaboration. The second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something—such as goodness, truth and beauty—by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his very uniqueness—by loving him. The Meaning of Love.

(1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The.

(1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.

Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.

Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how could I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, “What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?” “Oh,” he said, “for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!” Whereupon I replied, “You see, Doc- tor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering—to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.” He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my offce. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.

That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning.

To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.

“our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.”4.

Incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading” so that “he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.”.

There are situations in which one is cut off from the opportunity to do one’s work or to enjoy one’s life; but what never can be ruled out is the unavoidability of suffering. In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end.

Once, the mother of a boy who had died at the age of eleven years was admitted to my hospital department after a suicide attempt. Dr. Kurt Kocourek invited her to join a therapeutic group, and it happened that I stepped into the room where he was conducting a psychodrama. She was telling her story. At the death of her boy she was left alone with another, older son, who was crippled, suffering from the effects of infantile paralysis. The poor boy had to be moved around in a wheelchair. His mother, however, rebelled against her fate. But when she tried to commit suicide together with him, it was the crippled son who prevented her from doing so; he liked living! For him, life had remained meaningful. Why was it not so for his mother? How could her life still have a meaning? And how could we help her to become aware of it? Improvising, I participated in the discussion, and questioned another woman in the group. I asked her how old she was and she answered, “Thirty.” I replied, “No, you are not thirty but instead eighty and lying on your deathbed. And now you are looking back on your life, a life which was childless but full of financial success and social prestige.” And then I invited her to imagine what she would feel in this situation. “What will you think of it? What will you say to yourself?” Let me quote what she actually said from a tape which was recorded during that session. “Oh, I married a millionaire, I had an easy life full of wealth, and I lived it up! I flirted with men; I teased them! But now I am eighty; I have no children of my own. Looking back as an old woman, I cannot see what all that was for; actually, I must say, my life was a failure!” I then invited the mother of the handicapped son to imagine herself similarly looking back over her life. Let us listen to what she had to say as recorded on the tape: “I wished to have children and this wish has been granted to me; one boy died; the other, however, the crippled one, would have been sent to an institution if I had not taken over his care. Though he is crippled and helpless, he is after all my boy. And so I have made a fuller life possible for him; I have made a better human being out of my son.” At this moment, there was an outburst of tears and, crying, she continued: “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life; for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to fulfill it; I have done my best—I have done the best for my son. My life was no failure!” Viewing her life as if from her deathbed, she had suddenly been able to see a meaning in it, a meaning which even included all of her sufferings. By the same token, however, it had become clear as well that a life of short duration, like that, for example, of her dead boy, could be so rich in joy and love that it could contain more meaning than a life lasting eighty years.

The only world in which the meaning of its suffering would be understandable.

I observed that procreation is not the only meaning of life, for then life in itself would become meaningless, and something which in itself is meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by its perpetuation.

Nothing is irretrievably lost but everything irrevocably stored.

Man constantly makes his choice concerning the mass of present potentialities; which of these will be condemned to nonbeing and which will be actualized?.

The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”.

A realistic fear, like the fear of death, cannot be tranquilized away by its psychodynamic interpretation; on the other hand, a neurotic fear, such as agoraphobia, cannot be cured by philosophical understanding.

It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.

“The wish is father to the thought” to “The fear is mother of the event.”.

A similar case,.

On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying paradoxical intention—the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies.

To be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions.

Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.

Fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.

That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.

Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.

(1) pain; (2) guilt; and (3) death.

How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?.

It must be kept in mind, however, that optimism is not anything to be commanded or ordered. One cannot even force oneself to be optimistic indiscriminately, against all odds, against all hope. And what is true for hope is also true for the other two components of the triad inasmuch as faith and love cannot be commanded or ordered either.

One is commanded and ordered to “be happy.” But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.

One must have a reason to “be happy.” Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.

If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke.

Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capabil- ity to cope with suffering.

That people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning. To be sure, some do not even have the means.

Being jobless was equated with being useless, and being useless was equated with having a meaningless life.

The truth is that man does not live by welfare alone.

The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed.

The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love.

Most important, however, is the third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.

“he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.”.

Is this to say that suffering is indispensable to the discovery of meaning? In no way. I only insist that meaning is available in spite of—nay, even through—suffering, provided, as noted in Part Two of this book, that the suffering is unavoidable.

Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now. In fact,.

“George, you must realize that the world is a joke. There is no justice, everything is random. Only when you realize this will you understand how silly it is to take yourself seriously. There is no grand purpose in the universe. It just is. There’s no particular meaning in what decision you make today about how to act.”13.

“learned meaninglessness.”.

So, let us be alert—alert in a twofold sense: Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake.

ON JANUARY 27, 2006, the sixty-first anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, where 1.5 million people died, nations around the world observed the first International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

“It is we ourselves who must answer the questions that life asks of us, and to these questions we can respond only by being responsible for our existence.”.

Frankl’s work at Rothschild gave him and his family some degree of protection from the threat of deportation.

He does not tell people what to do, but why they must do it.

Reconciliation rather than revenge;.

“I do not forget any good deed done to me, and I do not carry a grudge for a bad one.”.

“the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.”.

Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, “The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.” “That was it, exactly,” Frankl said. “Those are the very words I had written.”.

Typically, if a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a person’s life, that alone justifies reading it, rereading it, and finding room for it on one’s shelves. This book has several such passages.

It was wrong for people to “try to capitalize on other people’s hardship and misery.”.

“It is astounding to me, the level of greed that someone must have in their soul to be willing to take advantage of someone suffering in the wake of a hurricane.”3.

Higher prices for ice, bottled water, roof repairs, generators, and motel rooms have the advantage, Sowell argued, of limiting the use of such things by consumers and increasing incentives for suppliers in far-off places to provide the goods and services most needed in the hurricane’s aftermath. If ice fetches ten dollars a bag when Floridians are facing power outages in the August heat, ice manufacturers will find it worth their while to produce and ship more of it.

There is nothing unjust about these prices, Sowell explained; they simply reflect the value that buyers and sellers choose to place on the things they exchange.6.

Maximizing welfare, respecting freedom, and promoting virtue.

“buyers under duress have no freedom.

What’s important to notice, however, is that the debate about price-gouging laws is not simply about welfare and freedom. It is also about virtue—about cultivating the attitudes and dispositions, the qualities of character, on which a good society depends.

Some people, including many who support price-gouging laws, find the virtue argument discomfiting. The reason: It seems more judgmental than arguments that appeal to welfare and freedom.

The virtue argument, by contrast, rests on a judgment that greed is a vice that the state should discourage. But.

By contrast, modern political philosophers—from Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century to John Rawls in the twentieth century—argue that the principles of justice that define our rights should not rest on any particular conception of virtue, or of the best way to live. Instead, a just society respects each person’s freedom to choose his or her own conception of the good life.

The dispute over the Purple Heart illustrates the moral logic of Aristotle’s theory of justice. We can’t determine who deserves a military medal without asking what virtues the medal properly honors. And to answer that question, we have to assess competing conceptions of character and sacrifice.

These days, most of our arguments about justice are about how to distribute the fruits of prosperity, or the burdens of hard times, and how to define the basic rights of citizens.

Americans are harder on failure than on greed. In market-driven societies, ambitious people are expected to pursue their interests vigorously, and the line between self-interest and greed often blurs.

Americans are harder on failure than on greed. In market-driven societies, ambitious people are expected to pursue their interests vigorously, and the line between self-interest and greed often blurs. But the line between success and failure is etched more sharply.

To ask whether a society is just is to ask how it distributes the things we prize—income and wealth, duties and rights, powers and opportunities, offices and honors.

As we’ve pondered the rights and wrongs of price gouging, competing claims to the Purple Heart, and financial bailouts, we’ve identified three ways of approaching the distribution of goods: welfare, freedom, and virtue.

To explore this idea, we turn to utilitarianism, the most influential account of how and why we should maximize welfare, or (as the utilitarians put it) seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

The idea that justice means respecting freedom and individual rights is at least as familiar in contemporary politics as the utilitarian idea of maximizing welfare.

Most of these theories emphasize respect for individual rights, though they disagree among themselves about which rights are most important.

Laissez-faire.

“Turn! Tragic though it is to kill one innocent person, it’s even worse to kill five.”.

Sacrificing one life in order to save five does seem the right thing to do.

Maybe the moral difference lies not in the effect on the victims—both wind up dead—but in the intention of the person making the decision.

We sometimes think of moral reasoning as a way of persuading other people. But it is also a way of sorting out our own moral convictions, of figuring out what we believe and why.

Some moral dilemmas arise from conflicting moral principles.

One principle that comes into play in the trolley story says we should save as many lives as possible, but another says it is wrong to kill an innocent person, even for a good cause.

Life in democratic societies is rife with disagreement about right and wrong, justice and injustice. Some people favor abortion rights, and others consider abortion to be murder. Some believe fairness requires taxing the rich to help the poor, while others believe it is unfair to tax away money people have earned through their own efforts. Some defend affirmative action in college admissions as a way of righting past wrongs, whereas others consider it an unfair form of reverse discrimination against people who deserve admission on their merits. Some people reject the torture of terror suspects as a moral abomination unworthy of a free society, while others defend it as a last resort to prevent a terrorist attack.

The answer is that moral reflection is not a solitary pursuit but a public endeavor. It requires an interlocutor—a friend, a neighbor, a comrade, a fellow citizen.

In Plato’s Republic, Socrates compares ordinary citizens to a group of prisoners confined in a cave. All they ever see is the play of shadows on the wall, a reflection of objects they can never apprehend. Only the philosopher, in this account, is able to ascend from the cave to the bright light of day, where he sees things as they really are. Socrates suggests that, having glimpsed the sun, only the philosopher is fit to rule the cave dwellers, if he can somehow be coaxed back into the darkness where they live.

The first approach says the morality of an action depends solely on the consequences it brings about; the right thing to do is whatever will produce the best state of affairs, all things considered.

The second approach says that consequences are not all we should care about, morally speaking; certain duties and rights should command our respect, for reasons independent of the social consequences.

The highest principle of morality is to maximize happiness, the overall balance of pleasure over pain.

All moral quarrels, properly understood, are disagreements about how to apply the utilitarian principle of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, not about the principle itself.

“Is it possible for a man to move the earth?” Bentham asks. “Yes; but he must first find out another earth to stand upon.”.

That diminished social utility. His scheme for pauper.

“It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.”20.

Mill thinks we should maximize utility, not case by case, but in the long run.

Allowing the majority to silence dissenters or censor free-thinkers might maximize utility today, but it will make society worse off—less happy—in the long run.

“Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure.”.

“Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor.”10 If the state has the right to claim some portion of my earnings, it also has the right to claim some portion of my time. Instead of taking, say, 30 percent of my income, it might just as well direct me to spend 30 percent of my time working for the state. But if the state can force me to labor on its behalf, it essentially asserts a.

Instead of taking, say, 30 percent of my income, it might just as well direct me to spend 30 percent of my time working for the state. But if the state can force me to labor on its behalf, it essentially asserts a property right in me.

Seizing the results of someone’s labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various activities. If people force you to do certain work, or unrewarded work, for a certain period of time, they decide what you are to do and what purposes your work is to serve apart from your decisions. This… makes them a part-owner of you; it gives them a property right in you.11.

If I own myself, I must own my labor. (If someone else could order me to work, that person would be my master, and I would be a slave.) But if I own my labor, I must be entitled to the fruits of my labor. (If someone else were entitled to my earnings, that person would own my labor and would therefore own me.) That is why, according to Nozick, taxing some of Michael Jordan’s $31 million to help the poor violates his rights. It asserts, in effect, that the state, or the community, is a part owner of him.

When, in 1993, Michael Jordan announced his retirement from basketball, Chicago Bulls fans were bereft. He would later come out of retirement and lead the Bulls to three more championships. But suppose that, in 1993, the Chicago City Council, or, for that matter, Congress, sought to ease the distress of Chicago Bulls fans by voting to require Jordan to play basketball for one-third of the next season. Most people would consider such a law unjust, a violation of Jordan’s liberty. But if Congress may not force Jordan to return to the basketball court (for even a third of the season), by what right does it force him to give up one-third of the.

Just because a patient on dialysis needs one of my kidneys more than I do (assuming I have two healthy ones) doesn’t mean he has a right to it. Nor may the state lay claim to one of my kidneys to help the dialysis patient, however urgent and pressing his needs may be. Why not? Because it’s mine. Needs don’t trump my fundamental right to do what I want with the things I own.

We can exercise free choice only if we’re not unduly pressured (by the need for money, say), and if we’re reasonably well informed about the alternatives.

Since human beings are capable of freedom, we shouldn’t be used as if we were mere objects, but should be treated instead with dignity and respect.

But what are those higher norms, and how can we know what modes of valuation are appropriate to what goods and social practices? One approach to this question begins with the idea of freedom. Since human beings are capable of freedom, we shouldn’t be used as if we were mere objects, but should be treated instead with dignity and respect. This approach emphasizes the distinction between persons (worthy of respect) and mere objects or things (open to use) as the fundamental distinction in morality. The greatest defender of this approach is Immanuel Kant, to whom we turn in the next chapter.

Right way of valuing goods and social practices depends on the purposes and ends those practices serve.

But the advent of in vitro fertilization (IVF) makes it possible for one woman to provide the egg and another to gestate it. Deborah.

Prospective parents no longer need to worry about the genetic characteristics of the woman they hire to carry their child, “because they’re acquiring those elsewhere.”53.

And are there certain virtues and higher goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?.

If you believe in universal human rights, you are probably not a utilitarian. If all human beings are worthy of respect, regardless of who they are or where they live, then it’s wrong to treat them as mere instruments of the collective happiness.

It argues that morality is not about maximizing happiness or any other end. Instead, it is about respecting persons as ends in themselves.

It does not depend on the idea that we own ourselves, or on the claim that our lives and liberties are a gift from God. Instead, it depends on the idea that we are rational beings, worthy of dignity and respect. Kant was.

Just because something gives many people pleasure doesn’t make it right.

Kant argues that morality can’t be based on merely empirical considerations, such as the interests, wants, desires, and preferences people have at any given time.

The utilitarian’s happiness principle “contributes nothing whatever toward establishing morality, since making a man happy is quite different from making him good and making him prudent or astute in seeking his advantage quite different from making him virtuous.”2.

Basing morality on interests and preferences destroys its dignity. It doesn’t teach us how to distinguish right from wrong, but “only to become better at calculation.”3 If our wants and desires can’t serve as the.

Basing morality on interests and preferences destroys its dignity. It doesn’t teach us how to distinguish right from wrong, but “only to become better at calculation.”3.

Kant argues that every person is worthy of respect, not because we own ourselves but because we are rational beings, capable of reason; we are also autonomous beings, capable of acting and choosing freely.

They make us more than mere creatures of appetite.

Our capacity for reason is bound up with our capacity for freedom. Taken together, these capacities make us distinctive, and set us apart from mere animal existence. They make us more than mere creatures of appetite.

We often think of freedom as the absence of obstacles to doing what we want.

When we, like animals, seek pleasure or the avoidance of pain, we aren’t really acting freely. We are acting as the slaves of our appetites and desires. Why? Because whenever we are seeking to satisfy our desires, everything we do is for the sake of some end given outside us. I go this way to assuage my hunger, that way to slake my thirst. Suppose I’m trying to decide what flavor of ice cream to order: Should I go for chocolate, vanilla, or espresso toffee crunch? I may think of myself as exercising freedom of choice, but what I’m really doing is trying to figure out which flavor will best satisfy my preferences—preferences I didn’t choose in the first place. Kant doesn’t say it’s wrong to satisfy our preferences. His point is that, when we do so, we are not acting freely, but acting according to a determination given outside us. After all, I didn’t choose my desire for espresso toffee crunch rather than vanilla. I just have it.

To act freely, according to Kant, is to act autonomously. And to act autonomously is to act according to a law I give myself—not according to.

To act freely, according to Kant, is to act autonomously. And to act autonomously is to act according to a law I give myself—not according to the dictates of nature or social convention.

When I act heteronomously, I act according to determinations given outside of me. Here is an illustration: When you drop a billiard ball, it falls to the ground. As it falls, the billiard ball is not acting freely; its movement is governed by the laws of nature—in this case, the law of gravity.

Suppose that I fall (or am pushed) from the Empire State Building. As I hurtle toward the earth, no one would say that I am acting freely; my movement is governed by the law of gravity, as with the billiard ball. Now suppose I land on another person and kill that person. I would not be morally responsible for the unfortunate death, any more than the billiard ball would be morally responsible if it fell from a great height and hit someone on the head. In neither case is the falling object—me or the billiard ball—acting freely. In both cases, the falling object is governed by the law of gravity. Since there is no autonomy, there can be no moral responsibility.

Here, then, is the link between freedom as autonomy and Kant’s idea of morality. To act freely is not to choose the best means to a given end; it is to choose the end itself, for its own sake—a choice that human beings can make and billiard balls (and most animals) cannot.

It is 3:00 a.m., and your college roommate asks you why you are up late pondering moral dilemmas involving runaway trolleys. “To write a good paper in Ethics 101,” you reply. “But why write a good paper?” your roommate asks. “To get a good grade.” “But why care about grades?” “To get a job in investment banking.” “But why get a job in investment banking?” “To become a hedge fund manager someday.” “But why be a hedge fund manager?” “To make a lot of money.” “But why make a lot of money?” “To eat lobster often, which I like. I am, after all, a sentient creature. That’s why I’m up late thinking about runaway trolleys!” This is an example of what Kant would call heteronomous determination—doing something for the sake of something else, for the sake of something else, and so on.

Kant’s notion of autonomy stands in stark contrast to this. When we act autonomously, according to a law we give ourselves, we do something for its own sake, as an end in itself. We cease to be instruments of purposes given outside us. This capacity to act autonomously is what gives human life its special dignity. It marks out the difference between persons and things.

For Kant, respecting human dignity means treating persons as ends in themselves. This is why it is wrong to use people for the sake of the general welfare, as utilitarianism does.

The moral worth of an action consists not in the consequences that flow from it, but in the intention from which the act is done.

What matters is doing the right thing because it’s right, not for some ulterior motive.

“A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes,” Kant writes. It is good in itself, whether or not it prevails. “Even if… this will is entirely lacking in power to carry out its intentions; if by its utmost effort it still accomplishes nothing… even then it would still shine like a jewel for its own sake as something which has its full value in itself.”4.

He’s simply observing that, when we assess the moral worth of an action, we assess the motive from which it’s done, not the consequences it produces.6 If we act out of some motive other than duty,.

He’s simply observing that, when we assess the moral worth of an action, we assess the motive from which it’s done, not the consequences it produces.6.

These cases bring out the plausibility of Kant’s claim that only the motive of duty—doing something because it’s right, not because it’s useful or convenient—confers moral worth on an action.

And he maintains that only the motive of duty confers moral worth on an action.

By “categorical,” Kant means unconditional. So,.

By “categorical,” Kant means unconditional. So, for example, when a politician issues a categorical denial of an alleged scandal, the denial is not merely emphatic; it’s unconditional—without any loophole or exception.

By “categorical,” Kant means unconditional. So, for example, when a politician issues a categorical denial of an alleged scandal, the denial is not merely emphatic; it’s unconditional—without any loophole or exception. Similarly, a categorical duty or categorical right is one that applies regardless of the circumstances.

Some people find this version of Kant’s categorical imperative unpersuasive. The formula of the universal law bears a certain resemblance to the moral bromide grown-ups use to chastise children who cut in line or speak out of turn: “What if everybody did that?” If everyone lied, then no one could rely on anybody’s word, and we’d all be worse off. If this is what Kant is saying, he is making a consequentialist argument after all—rejecting the false promise not in principle, but for its possibly harmful effects or consequences.

It is wrong because, in making it, I privilege my needs and desires (in this case, for money) over everybody else’s.

Acting freely, that is, autonomously, and acting morally, according to the categorical imperative, are one and the same. This way of thinking about morality.

Acting freely, that is, autonomously, and acting morally, according to the categorical imperative, are one and the same.

It stands at a certain distance from the world. It passes judgment on the world. Science can’t, for all its power and insight, reach moral questions, because it operates within the sensible realm.

But suppose a friend was hiding in your house, and a murderer came to the door looking for him. Wouldn’t it be right to lie to the murderer? Kant says no. The duty to tell the truth holds regardless of the consequences.

Admittedly, helping a murderer carry out his evil deed is a pretty heavy “disadvantage.” But remember, for Kant, morality is not about consequences; it’s about principle.

Consider “white lies,” the small untruths we sometimes tell out of politeness, to avoid hurt feelings. Suppose.

“No one can compel me to be happy in accordance with his conception of the welfare of others,” Kant writes, “for each may seek his happiness in whatever way he sees fit, so long as he does not infringe upon the freedom of others” to do the same.45.

The mere fact that a group of people in the past agreed to a constitution is not enough to make that constitution just.

In A Theory of Justice (1971), he argues that the way to think about justice is to ask what principles we would agree to in an initial situation of equality.2.

The famous words of Don Corleone in The Godfather, “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse,” suggest (in extreme form) the pressure that hovers, to some degree, over most negotiations.

First, the fact of an agreement does not guarantee the fairness of the agreement.

Second, consent is not enough to create a binding moral claim.

It wrongly assumes that wherever there is an obligation, there must have been an agreement—some act of consent.

The veil of ignorance ensures the equality of power and knowledge that the original position requires.

If a knowledge of particulars is allowed, then the outcome is biased by arbitrary contingencies… If the original position is to yield agreements that are just, the parties must be fairly situated and treated equally as moral persons.

If we are bothered by the fact that some runners are faster than others, don’t we have to make the gifted runners wear lead shoes? Some critics of egalitarianism believe that the only alternative to a meritocratic market society is a leveling equality that imposes handicaps on the talented.

“Harrison Bergeron,” a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., plays out this worry as dystopian science fiction.

The real affirmative action debate is about two other rationales—the compensatory argument and the diversity argument.

Critics point out that those who benefit are not necessarily those who have suffered, and those who pay the compensation are seldom those responsible for the wrongs being rectified.

It treats admission less as a reward to the recipient than as a means of advancing a socially worthy aim.

But many proponents of affirmative action are not utilitarians; they are Kantian or Rawlsian liberals who believe that even desirable ends must not override individual rights.

Ronald Dworkin, a rights-oriented legal philosopher, addresses this objection by arguing that the use of race in affirmative action policies doesn’t violate anybody’s rights.10 What right, he asks, has Hopwood been denied? Perhaps she believes that people have a right not to be judged according to factors, such as race, that are beyond their control. But most traditional criteria for university admission involve factors beyond one’s control. It’s not my fault that I come from Massachusetts rather than Idaho, or that I’m a lousy football player, or that I can’t carry a tune. Nor is it my fault if I lack the aptitude to do well on the SAT.

If it's not your fault that you belong to a particular class, then it's not there fault if they lack aptitude.

Admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit or virtue. Neither the student with high test scores nor the student who comes from a disadvantaged minority group morally deserves to be admitted. Her Admission is justified insofar as it contributes to the social purpose the university serves, not because it rewards the student for her merit or virtue, independently defined.

Dworkin’s account of justice in university admissions runs parallel to Rawls’s account of justice in income distribution: It is not a matter of moral desert.

Anti-Semitic feeling among students is increasing,” he said,.

Dear successful applicant, We are pleased to inform you that your application for admission has been accepted. It turns out that you happen to have the traits that society needs at the moment, so we propose to exploit your assets for society’s advantage by admitting you to the study of law. You are to be congratulated, not in the sense that you deserve credit for having the qualities that led to your admission—you do not—but only in the sense that the winner of a lottery is to be congratulated. You are lucky to have come along with the right traits at the right moment. If you choose to accept our offer, you will ultimately be entitled to the benefits that attach to being used in this way. For this, you may properly celebrate. You, or more likely your parents, may be tempted to celebrate in the further sense that you take this admission to reflect favorably, if not on your native endowments, then at least on the conscientious effort you have made to cultivate your abilities. But the notion that you deserve even the superior character necessary to your effort is equally problematic, for your character depends on fortunate circumstances of various kinds for which you can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply here. We look forward nonetheless to seeing you in the fall. Sincerely yours….

Callie is being accorded an honor she doesn’t deserve, in a way that mocks the pride he takes in his daughter’s cheerleading prowess. If great cheerleading is something that can be done from a wheelchair, then the honor accorded those who excel at tumbles and splits is depreciated to some degree.

Justice is teleological. Defining rights requires us to figure out the telos (the purpose, end, or essential nature) of the social practice in question. Justice is honorific. To reason about the telos of a practice—or to argue about it—is, at least in part, to reason or argue about what virtues it should honor and reward.

He believes that debates about justice are, unavoidably, debates about honor, virtue, and the nature of the good life.

For Aristotle, justice means giving people what they deserve, giving each person his or her due.

Suppose we’re distributing flutes. Who should get the best ones? Aristotle’s answer: the best flute players.

“Am I more handsome than she is a good lacrosse player?” Or, “Was Babe Ruth a greater baseball player than Shakespeare was a playwright?”.

(Teleological comes from the Greek word telos, which means purpose, end, or goal.).

Plato and Aristotle thought that fire rose because it was reaching for the sky, its natural home, and that stones fell because they were striving to get closer to the earth, where they belonged.

Plato and Aristotle thought that fire rose because it was reaching for the sky, its natural home, and that stones fell because they were striving to get closer to the earth, where they belonged. Nature was seen as having a meaningful order. To understand nature, and our place in it, was to grasp.

Plato and Aristotle thought that fire rose because it was reaching for the sky, its natural home, and that stones fell because they were striving to get closer to the earth, where they belonged. Nature was seen as having a meaningful order. To understand nature, and our place in it, was to grasp its purpose, its essential meaning.

With the advent of modern science, nature ceased to be seen as a meaningful order. Instead, it came to be understood mechanistically, governed by the laws of physics. To explain natural phenomena in terms of purposes, meanings, and ends was now considered naïve and anthropomorphic. Despite this shift, the temptation to see the world as teleologically ordered, as a purposeful whole, is not wholly absent. It persists, especially in children, who have to be educated out of seeing the world in this way. I noticed this when my children were very young, and I read them the book Winnie-the-Pooh, by A. A. Milne. The story evokes a childlike view of nature as enchanted, animated by meaning and purpose. Early in the book, Winnie-the-Pooh is walking in the forest and comes to a large oak tree. From the top of the tree, “there came a loud buzzing-noise.” Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think. First of all he said to himself: “That buzzing-noise means something. You don’t get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there’s a buzzing-noise, somebody’s making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you’re a bee.” Then he thought another long time, and said: “And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.” And then he got up, and said: “And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.” So he began to climb the tree.4 Pooh’s childlike line of thought about the bees is a good example of teleological reasoning. By the time we are adults, most of us outgrow this way of viewing the natural world, seeing it as charming but quaint. And having rejected teleological thinking in science, we are also inclined to reject it in politics and morals. But it is not easy to dispense with teleological reasoning in thinking about social institutions and political practices. Today, no scientist reads Aristotle’s works on biology or physics and takes them seriously. But students of ethics and politics continue to read and ponder Aristotle’s moral and political philosophy.

What virtues or excellences do universities properly honor and reward? Those who believe that universities exist to celebrate and reward scholarly excellence alone are likely to reject affirmative action, whereas those who believe universities also exist to promote certain civic ideals may well embrace it.

Authority—oligarchs and democrats.

The oligarchs maintain that they, the wealthy, should rule.

The democrats maintain that free birth should be the sole criterion of citizenship and political authority.

He rejects the notion that the purpose of politics is to satisfy the preferences of the majority.

For Aristotle, politics is about something higher. It’s about learning how to live a good life. The purpose of politics is nothing less than to enable people to develop their distinctive human capacities and virtues—to deliberate about the common good, to acquire practical judgment, to share in self-government, to care for the fate of the community as a whole.

“A polis is not an association for residence on a common site, or for the sake of preventing mutual injustice and easing exchange.” While these conditions are necessary to a polis, they are not sufficient. “The end and purpose of a polis is the good life, and the institutions of social life are means to that end.”8.

Nature makes nothing in vain, and human beings, unlike other animals, are furnished with the faculty of language. Other animals can make sounds, and sounds can indicate pleasure and pain. But language, a distinctly human capacity, isn’t just for registering pleasure and pain. It’s about declaring what is just and what is unjust, and distinguishing right from wrong. We don’t grasp these things silently, and then put words to them; language is the medium through which we discern and deliberate about the good.10.

Happiness is not a state of mind but a way of being,.

“an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.”.

“Legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.”.

Generality doesn’t get us very far, because discerning.

Modern political theories are uneasy with the notion of fit. Liberal theories of justice, from Kant to Rawls, worry that teleological conceptions are at odds with freedom. For them, justice is not about fit but about choice.

Aristotle, two conditions must be met: it must.

For slavery to be just, according to Aristotle, two conditions must be met: it must be necessary, and it must be natural. Slavery is necessary, Aristotle argues, because someone must look after the household chores if citizens are to spend time in the assembly deliberating about the common good. The polis requires a division of labor. Unless we invent machines that could take care of all menial tasks, some people have to attend to the necessities of life so that others can be free to participate in politics.

For the libertarian, the answer would depend on whether the workers.

Consider a repetitive, dangerous job, such as working long hours on an assembly line in a chicken processing plant. Is this form.

Consider a repetitive, dangerous job, such as working long hours on an assembly line in a chicken processing plant. Is this form of labor just or unjust? For the libertarian, the answer would depend on whether the workers had freely exchanged their labor for a wage: if they did, the work is just. For Rawls, the arrangement would be just only if the free exchange of labor took place against fair background conditions. For Aristotle, even consent against fair background conditions is not sufficient; for the work to be just, it has to be suited to the nature of the workers who perform it. Some jobs fail this test. They are so dangerous, repetitive, and deadening as to be unfit for human beings. In those cases, justice requires that the work be reorganized to accord with our nature. Otherwise, the job is unjust in the same way that slavery is.

Objection disappears. But this solution was anathema.

Casey Martin.

Golfers are somewhat sensitive about the status of their game. It involves no running or jumping, and the ball stands still. No one doubts that golf is a demanding game of skill. But the honor and recognition accorded great golfers depends on their sport being seen as a physically demanding athletic competition. If the game at which they excel can be played while riding in a cart, their recognition as athletes could be questioned or diminished. This may explain the vehemence with which some professional golfers opposed Casey Martin’s bid for a cart.

Debates about justice and rights are often, unavoidably, debates about the purpose of social institutions, the goods they allocate, and the virtues they honor and reward. Despite our best attempts to make law neutral on such questions, it may not be possible to say what’s just without arguing about the nature of the good life.

German chancellor Konrad Adenauer claimed that “the overwhelming majority of the German people abominated the crimes committed against the Jews and did not participate in them.” But he acknowledged that “unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity.”2 In 2000, German president Johannes Rau apologized for the Holocaust in a speech to the Israeli Knesset, asking “forgiveness for.

Walter E. Williams, an African American economist who opposes reparations, voiced a similar view: “If the government got the money from the tooth fairy or Santa Claus, that’d be great. But the government has to take the money from citizens, and there are no citizens alive today who were responsible for slavery.”22.

An early version of the choosing self comes to us from John Locke. He argued that legitimate government must be based on consent. Why? Because we are free and independent beings, not subject to paternal authority or the divine right of kings. Since we are “by nature, all free, equal and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent.”25.

Kant argued that we must think of ourselves as more than a bundle of preferences and desires. To be free is to be autonomous, and to be autonomous is to be governed by a law I give myself. Kantian autonomy is more demanding than consent.

Kant’s idea of an autonomous will and Rawls’s idea of a hypothetical agreement behind a veil of ignorance have this in common: both conceive the moral agent as independent of his or her particular aims and attachments.

Conceiving persons as free and independent selves doesn’t only make a difference for questions of collective responsibility across generations.

Conceiving persons as free and independent selves doesn’t only make a difference for questions of collective responsibility across generations. It also has a more far-reaching implication: Thinking of the moral agent in this way carries consequences for the way we think about justice more generally.

They argue that the right is prior to the good.

Kant and Rawls reject Aristotle’s teleology because it doesn’t seem to leave us room to choose our good for ourselves.

“if the fruits of his labor are not his to dispose of, but are treated, instead, as part of a common pool of public wealth?”35.

Human beings are storytelling beings. We live our lives as narrative quests. “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ ”36.

The contrast with the narrative view of the self is clear. For the story of my life is always embedded in the story of those communities from which I derive my identity. I am born with a past; and to try to cut myself off from that past, in the individualist mode, is to deform my present relationships.42.

“there is no political obligation, strictly speaking, for citizens generally.”.

And Israel, as a Jewish state founded in the wake of the Holocaust, was created to provide a homeland for Jews.

One was the belief that the war was unjust; the other was the belief that the war was unworthy of us and at odds with who we are as a people. The first reason can be taken up by opponents of the war whoever they are or wherever they live. But the second reason can be felt and voiced only by citizens of the country responsible for the war.

Given the close connection between an ethic of pride and shame and an ethic of collective responsibility, it is puzzling to find political conservatives rejecting collective apologies on individualist grounds (as did Henry Hyde, John Howard, and others mentioned earlier).

Anyone anywhere can admire the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, the fallen heroes honored in Arlington National Cemetery, and so on. But patriotic pride requires a sense of belonging to a community extended across time.

With belonging comes responsibility. You can’t really take pride in your country and its past if you’re unwilling to acknowledge any responsibility for carrying its story into the present, and discharging the moral burdens that may come with it.

For Kant and Rawls, the right is prior to the good.

The principles of justice that define our duties and rights should be neutral with respect to competing conceptions of the good life.

This way of thinking about justice is at odds with Aristotle’s way. He doesn’t believe that principles of justice can or should be neutral with respect to the good life. To the contrary, he maintains that one of the purposes of a just constitution is to form good citizens and to cultivate good character. He doesn’t think it’s possible to deliberate about justice without deliberating about the meaning of the goods—the offices, honors, rights, and opportunities—that societies allocate.

If Kant and Rawls are right to conceive freedom in this way, then they are right about justice as well. If we are freely choosing, independent selves, unbound by moral ties antecedent to choice, then we need a framework of rights that is neutral among ends. If the self is prior to its ends, then the right must be prior to the good.

If, however, the narrative conception of moral agency is more persuasive, then it may be worth reconsidering Aristotle’s way of thinking about justice. If deliberating about my good involves reflecting on the good of those communities with which my identity is bound, then the aspiration to neutrality may be mistaken. It may not be possible, or even desirable, to deliberate about justice without deliberating about the good life.

Kennedy was a Catholic, and no Catholic had ever been elected president.

Said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can’t impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the U.S. Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois.”4.

Republicans invoked the idea in economic policy, while Democrats applied it to social and cultural issues.

Republicans argued against government intervention in free markets on the grounds that individuals should be free to make their own economic choices and spend their money as they pleased; for government to spend taxpayers’ money or regulate economic activity for public purposes was to impose a state-sanctioned vision of the common good that not everyone shared. Tax cuts were preferable to government spending, because they left individuals free to decide for themselves what ends to pursue and how to spend their own money.

Consummated their marriage, and never plan.

One says justice means maximizing utility or welfare—the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The second says justice means respecting freedom of choice—either the actual choices people make in a free market (the libertarian view) or the hypothetical choices people would make in an original position of equality (the liberal egalitarian view). The third says justice involves cultivating virtue and reasoning about the common good. As you’ve probably guessed by now, I favor a version of the third approach. Let me try to explain why.

First, it makes justice and rights a matter of calculation, not principle. Second, by trying to translate all human goods into a single, uniform measure of value, it flattens them, and takes no account of the qualitative differences among them.

Just society can’t be achieved simply by maximizing utility or by securing freedom of choice. To achieve a just society we have to reason together about the meaning of the good life, and to create a public culture hospitable to the disagreements that will inevitably arise. It is tempting to seek a principle or procedure that could justify, once and for all, whatever distribution of income or power or opportunity resulted from it.

Our Gross National Product now is over 800 billion dollars a year. But that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts… the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the Gross National Product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud to be Americans.40.

Should students in underperforming schools be offered cash payments for scoring well on standardized tests? Should teachers be given bonuses for improving the test results of their students? Should states hire for-profit prison companies to house their inmates? Should the United States simplify its immigration policy by adopting the proposal of a University of Chicago economist to sell U.S. citizenship for a $100,000 fee?42.

In recent decades, we’ve come to assume that respecting our fellow citizens’ moral and religious convictions means ignoring them (for political purposes, at least), leaving them undisturbed, and conducting our public life—insofar as possible—without reference to them. But this stance of avoidance can make for a spurious respect.

It’s always possible that learning more about a moral or religious doctrine will lead us to like it less. But we cannot know until we try. A politics of moral engagement is not only a more inspiring ideal than a politics of avoidance. It is also a more promising basis for a just society. NOTES.

# Reservoir Geomechanics (Zoback, Mark D.)

Elevated pore pressures pose a severe risk during drilling when hydrocarbons are present and place important constraints on the density of drilling mud (i.e. mud weights) used during drilling.

Elevated pore pressure also influences maximum hydrocarbon column height in some reservoirs as well as the leakage potential of reservoir-bounding faults.

Reductions in reservoir pore pressure with production (depletion) can cause significant deformation in a reservoir including compaction and permeability loss (especially in poorly consolidated and weak formations) and, perhaps counter-intuitively, induce faulting in some reservoirs in normal faulting regimes or the surrounding region (.

Pore pressure is defined as a scalar hydraulic potential acting within an interconnected pore space at depth. The.

Pore pressure is defined as a scalar hydraulic potential acting within an interconnected pore space at depth. The value of pore pressure at depth is usually described in relation to hydrostatic (or normal) pressure, the pressure associated with a column of water from the surface to the depth of interest.

Lithostatic pore pressure means that the pressure in the pores of the rock is equivalent to the weight of the overburden stress Sv. Because of the negligibly small tensile strength of rock (Chapter 4), pore pressure will always be less than the least principal stress, S3.

At relatively shallow depths (in this case to about 8000 ft), pore pressures are essentially hydrostatic, implying that a continuous, interconnected column of pore fluid extends from the surface to that depth.

Between 8000 ft and 11,000 ft pore pressure increases with depth very rapidly indicating that these formations are hydraulically isolated from shallower depths.

By 11,000 ft, pore pressures reach values close to that of the overburden stress, a condition sometimes referred to as hard overpressures.

Thus, it is always important to consider pore pressure (especially overpressure) in the context of the mechanisms responsible for it (see below) and local geologic conditions.

The easiest way to think about separate reservoir compartments is in the context of a series of permeable sands separated by impermeable shales.

The observation that a given reservoir can sometimes be compartmentalized and hydraulically isolated from surrounding formations has received a lot of attention over the past decades. The.

The observation that a given reservoir can sometimes be compartmentalized and hydraulically isolated from surrounding formations has received a lot of attention over the past decades.

Note that the individual sand reservoirs (shaded in the figure) are (i) separated by thick sequences of shale (not shaded), (ii) laterally discontinuous and (iii) frequently truncated by growth faults that provide up-dip closure (Alexander.

At a given depth, ongoing sedimentation increases the overburden stress which, in turn, will tend to cause compaction and porosity loss.

In a hydraulically open system, that is, in sufficiently permeable formations to be hydrologically connected to earth’s surface, the compaction and porosity loss associated with burial can be accommodated by fluid flow without excess pressure build up. This is apparently the case with the formations at depths less than 8000 ft.

However, in a low permeability formation (such as a shale), in confined sands isolated from other sands (such as with the formations deeper than 9000 ft in Figure 2.2), or in regions of such rapid sedimentation and compaction fluid expulsion cannot keep pace with the porosity loss. In this case, the increasing overburden stress driving compaction will cause increases in pore pressure as the overburden stress is carried by the pore fluid pressure.

Large accumulations (many km) of sediment over the past several million years. This sedimentation has caused compaction-induced pore pressures, which can reach extremely high values at great depth where extremely thick sequences of impermeable shales prevent drainage (Gordon and Flemings 1998). It should be noted that under conditions of severe undercompaction, porosity is quite high and the lithostatic gradient can be significantly below 23 MPa/km (1 psi/ft).

Centroid effects refer to the fact that relatively high pore pressure occurs at the top of a tilted sand body encased in shale.

Hydrocarbon column heights can result in substantial overpressure at the top of reservoir compartments, especially when appreciable amounts of buoyant gas.

Hydrocarbon column heights can result in substantial overpressure at the top of reservoir compartments, especially when appreciable amounts of buoyant gas are present.

Pressure in very weak shales is presumed to increase with a lithostatic gradient (as below 11,000 ft in Figure 2.2).

Aquathermal pressurizationrefers to a mechanism of overpressure generation stemming from the fact that as sediments are buried, they are heated. Temperature increases with depth in the earth due to heat produced by radioactive decay of crystalline basement rocks and heat flowing upward through the crust from the mantle. Because heating causes expansion of pore fluid at depth, in a confined and relatively incompressible rock matrix, expanding pore fluid pore would lead in theory to pressure increases.

Dehydration reactions associated with mineral diagenesis have been proposed as another mechanism that could lead to overpressure development.

Dehydration reactions associated with mineral diagenesis have been proposed as another mechanism that could lead to overpressure development. Smectite dehydration is a complex process (Hall 1993) but can lead to overall volume increases of both the rock matrix and the pore water system. One component of this process is the phase transition from montmorillonite to illite, which involves the expulsion of water from the crystal lattice of montmorillonite. The transition occurs at a temperature of about 100°C in the Gulf of Mexico, which is often correlative with the depth at which overpressures are observed to develop (Bruce 1984). The transition of anhydrite to gypsum is another dehydration reaction that can lead to overpressure development, but only at relatively shallow depths as the temperature at which this dehydration occurs is only about half that of the smectite–illite transition.

Hydrocarbon generation from the thermal maturation of kerogen in hydrocarbon source rocks is associated with marked increases in the volume of pore fluid and thus can also lead to overpressure generation. This.

Hydrocarbon generation from the thermal maturation of kerogen in hydrocarbon source rocks is associated with marked increases in the volume of pore fluid and thus can also lead to overpressure generation. This is true of the generation of both oil and gas from kerogen, although the latter process is obviously more important in terms of changes in the volume of pore fluids.

Direct measurement of pore pressure in relatively permeable formations is straightforward using a variety of commercially available technologies conveyed either by wireline (samplers that isolate formation pressure from annular pressure in a small area at the wellbore wall) or pipe (packers and drill-stem testing tools that isolate sections intervals of a formation). Similarly, mud weights are sometimes used to estimate pore pressure in permeable formations as they tend to take drilling mud if the mud pressure is significantly in excess of the pore pressure and produce fluids into the well if the converse is true.

Hydrostatic compression tests in which the applied stress is a uniform confining pressure and an impermeable membrane separates the pore volume of the rock from the confining pressure medium; and confined compaction tests in which the sample is subjected to an axial load while enclosed in a rigid steel cylinder that prevents lateral expansion of the sample. The data shown in Figure 2.13 were collected with the latter type of apparatus because it was thought to be more analogous to vertical loading in situ.

The onset of overpressure at depths greater than C is associated with a decrease in effective stress (the difference between the overburden and pore pressure) as well as a reversal of the increase in effective stress with depth.

The onset of overpressure at depths greater than C is associated with a decrease in effective stress (the difference between the overburden and pore pressure) as well as a reversal of the increase in effective stress with depth. This corresponds to anomalously high porosity at depth due to the anomalously high pressure.

The existence of anomalously high pore pressure at depth E can be inferred from the marked deviation from the normal compaction trend.

Assuming that the deviations from the normal compaction trends is evidence of overpressure.

A somewhat more direct approach to estimation of pore pressure from seismic interval velocity data is based on empirical correlations between P-wave velocity, Vp, S-wave velocity, Vs, both in units of km/s, mean effective stress, σ, in units of kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa), porosity, φ, and clay content, C, based on point counts of thin sections (0  C  1).

It is important to note that these methodologies apply best to shales because in sands and carbonates variations in cementation and diagenesis affect how they compact with depth such that relations such as equation (2.4) are not applicable (Burrus 1998). Second, because the method assumes that all shales in a given section follow the same compaction trend, variations of shale lithology with depth represent a decrease in effective stress, whereas they could result from a change of lithology. Third, there are a variety of opinions about how pressure, or stress, in the lab should be related to depth in the earth. Does hydrostatic confining pressure correspond to the overburden stress, Sv; or does a laterally confined uniaxial compression test correspond to Sv; or does hydrostatic confining pressure (or mean stress in a uniaxial compression test) correspond to mean stress in the earth, thus requiring knowledge (or estimates) of Shmin and SHmax?.

Compaction-based methods assume a prograde burial path in which effective stress monotonically increases with burial and time. Hence, in such regions, the deviation from the expected porosity at a given depth is evidence of anomalously high pore pressure. In.

Compaction-based methods assume a prograde burial path in which effective stress monotonically increases with burial and time. Hence, in such regions, the deviation from the expected porosity at a given depth is evidence of anomalously high pore pressure. In regions with a complex burial history and/or a history of pore pressure generation, the fundamental assumption of a monotonic increase of effective stress with depth and time is incorrect.

For example, induced micro-fracturing would tend to affect measurements of sonic velocity or formation resistivity logs but not bulk measurements such as density or neutron porosity.

A linearly elastic material (Figure 3.1a) is one in which stress and strain are linearly proportional and deformation is reversible.

Presence of water or oil in the pores of a rock will result in time-dependent deformation of any porous elastic (poroelastic) solid.

A porous rock saturated with fluid will exhibit poroelastic behavior. One manifestation of poreoelasticity is that the stiffness of a fluid-saturated rock will depend on the rate at which external force is applied. When force is applied quickly, the pore pressure in the rock’s pores increases because the pore fluid is carrying some of the applied stress and the rock behaves in an undrained manner. In other words, if stress is applied faster than fluid pressure can drain away, the fluid carries some of the applied stress and the rock is relatively stiff. However, when an external force is applied slowly, any increase in fluid pressure associated with compression of the pores has time to drain away such that the rock’s stiffness is the same as if no fluid was present. It is obvious that there is a trade-off between the loading rate, permeability of the rock and viscosity of the pore fluid, which is discussed further below.

Show how the shear strength of pre-existing faults constrains in situ stress magnitudes in the crust. These constraints will be further refined by combining with direct measurements of the least principal stress through some form of hydraulic fracturing in Chapter 6 and.

Intentionally induce micro-seismicity to enhance permeability in low-permeability formations. Hence, knowing that relatively small perturbations of stress may induce fault slip is important in field development in many regions.

Slip on faults can be a source of wellbore instability (Chapters 10 and 12) and third, active faults provide efficient conduits for fluid flow in fractured reservoirs and influence the seal capacity of reservoir bounding faults (Chapter 11).

Hydrostatic compression tests (S1 = S2 = S3 = S0) are those in which a sample is subjected to a uniform confining pressure, S0. Such tests yield information about rock compressibility and the pressure at which pore collapse (irreversible porosity loss) occurs.

Uniaxial compressive tests (S1 > 0, S2 = S3 = 0) are those in which one simply compresses a sample axially (with no radial stress) until it fails at a value defined as the unconfined compressive strength (usually termed either the UCS or C0).

Uniaxial tension tests (S1 < 0, S2 = S3 = 0).

This type of test procedure tends to promote failure along pre-existing fractures or flaws that might be present in a sample.

Triaxial compression tests (S1 > S2 = S3 = S0) are the most common way of measuring rock strength under conditions that presumably simulate those at depth. Such tests are unfortunately named triaxial as there are only two different stresses of interest, the confining pressure S0 and the differential stress S1 − S0. The strength of the sample at a given confining pressure is the differential stress at which it fails. The confining pressure is held constant as the sample is loaded. As in the case of hydrostatic compression tests, it is relatively straightforward to include the effects of pore pressure in such tests.

Triaxial extension tests (S1 = S2 > S3 where S3 acts in an axial direction) can also be used to measure the compressive rock strength but are typically carried out only as part of specialized rock mechanical testing programs. One advantage of such tests is that they are useful for studying strength at low effective stress. A combination of triaxial compression and triaxial extension tests can be used to determine the importance of the intermediate principal stress, S2, on failure. As discussed below, the importance of S2 is often ignored.

Polyaxial, or true triaxial, tests (S1 > S2 > S3) are the only tests in which the three principal stresses are different. While these tests can most accurately replicate in situ conditions, such tests are extremely hard to conduct for several.

Thick-walled cylinder tests. In these tests a small axial hole is drilled along the axis of a cylindrical sample. These tests are done to determine the approximate strain around the axial hole at which failure is first noted. Such tests are done to support sand production studies such.

The failure of rock in compression is a complex process that involves microscopic failures manifest as the creation of small tensile cracks and frictional sliding on grain boundaries.

There is a coalescence of these microscopic failures into a through-going shear.

With the material essentially losing all of its strength when a through-going shear fault forms.

By rock strength we typically mean the value of the maximum principal stress at which a sample loses its ability to support applied stress.

Series of triaxial strength tests at different effective confining pressures defines the Mohr failure envelope which typically flattens as confining pressure increases.

Linear simplification of the Mohr failure envelope is usually referred to as Mohr–Coulomb failure.

It is universally observed in such tests that sample strength is seen to increase monotonically with effective confining pressure.

Because of this, it is common to present strength test results using Mohr circles and Mohr failure envelopes.

The basis for the Mohr circle construction is that it is possible to evaluate graphically the shear stress, τf, and effective normal stress (σn = Sn − Pp) on the fault that forms during the failure process in terms of the applied effective principal stresses σ1 and σ3,.

Conducting a series of triaxial tests defines an empirical Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope that describes failure of the rock at different confining pressures (Figure 4.2b.

Allowable stress states (as described by Mohr circles) are those that do not intersect the Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope.

Stress states corresponding to Mohr circles which exceed the failure line are not allowed because failure of the rock would have occurred prior to the rock having achieved such a stress state.

The slope of the Mohr failure envelopes for most rocks decreases as confining pressure increases,.

The unconfined compressive strength (termed the UCS or C0). One could also describe the linear Mohr failure line in terms of its intercept when σ3 = 0 which is called the cohesive strength (or cohesion), S0, as is common in soil mechanics. In.

While uniaxial tests are obviously the easiest way to measure C0, it is preferable to determine C0 by conducting a series of triaxial tests to avoid the axial splitting of the samples that frequently occurs during uniaxial tests and the test results are sensitive to the presence of pre-existing flaws in the samples.

Once a Mohr envelope has been obtained through a series of tests, one can find C0 by either fitting the envelope with a linear Mohr failure line and determining the uniaxial compressive strength graphically, or simply by measuring strength at many pressures and plotting the data.

Important concept to keep in mind when considering.

An important concept to keep in mind when considering rock strength is that while strong rocks have high cohesion and weak rocks have low cohesion, nearly all rocks have relatively high coefficients of internal friction.

In other words, the rocks with low cohesion (or low compressive strength) are weak at low mean stresses but increase in strength as the mean stress increases.

One exception to this is shales, which tend to have a somewhat lower value of μi. This is discussed below in the section.

The Mohr circle is drawn for a point around the wellbore. For weak rocks (low cohesion), when mud weight and pore pressure are equal, the wellbore wall fails in compression as the radial stress, σrr is equal to 0. Raising mud weight increases σrr and decreases σθθ, the hoop stress acting around the wellbore. This stabilizes the wellbore by reducing the size of the Mohr circle all around the circumference of the well. Figure 6.1.

Schematic illustration of how raising mud weight helps stabilize a wellbore. The Mohr circle is drawn for a point around the wellbore. For weak rocks (low cohesion), when mud weight and pore pressure are equal, the wellbore wall fails in compression as the radial stress, σrr is equal to 0. Raising mud weight increases σrr and decreases σθθ, the hoop stress acting around the wellbore. This stabilizes the wellbore by reducing the size of the Mohr circle all around the circumference of the well.

Linearized Mohr envelopes are shown schematically for a strong rock (high cohesive strength) and weak rock (low cohesive strength) with the same μi. As.

Linearized Mohr envelopes are shown schematically for a strong rock (high cohesive strength) and weak rock (low cohesive strength) with the same μi.

When one considers the stresses at the wall of a vertical wellbore that might cause compressive rock failure, the least principal stress, σ3, is usually the radial stress, σrr, which is equal to the difference between the mud weight, Pm, and the pore pressure, P0. The maximum principal stress driving failure of the wellbore wall is σθθ, the hoop stress acting parallel to the wellbore wall in a circumferential manner (Figure 6.1).

The cohesive strength of the rock is quite low, when the mud weight is exactly equal to the pore pressure (i.e. the mud weight is exactly balanced with the pore pressure), σθθ does not have to be very large to exceed the strength of the rock at the wellbore wall and cause wellbore failure because σrr = 0. However, if the mud weight exceeds the pore pressure, σrr increases and σθθ decreases, thus resulting in a more stable wellbore. This is discussed more thoroughly in Chapter 6. Of course, drillers learned this lesson empirically a century ago as the use of mud weight to stabilize wellbores is one of a number of considerations.

The presence of weak bedding planes in shaley rocks (or finely laminated sandstones or foliation planes in metamorphic rocks) can sometimes have a marked effect on rock strength.

The influence of weak bedding planes on rock strength is referred to as strength anisotropy.

The intact rock would have its normal strength which would control failure when slip on bedding planes did not occur and a lower strength, defined by the cohesion, Sw, and internal friction, μw, of the weak bedding planes which would apply.

The importance of weak bedding planes in shale is quite important in two case studies presented in Chapter 10. In northern South America, shales which have a UCS of about 10,000 psi (when measured normal to bedding) have very weak bedding planes with Sw = 300 psi and μw = 0.5 which greatly affects wellbore stability for wells at some trajectories to the steeply dipping bedding planes.

Core samples of overburden formations (where many wellbore instability problems are encountered) are almost never available for testing.

Numerous relations have been proposed that relate rock strength to parameters measurable with geophysical well logs.

The basis for these relations is the fact that many of the same factors that affect rock strength also affect elastic moduli and other parameters, such as porosity.

Unlike compressional strength, tensile strength does not seem to be dependent on simple effective stress, especially in low-porosity/low-permeability rocks.

Slip on faults is important in a number of geomechanical contexts. Slip on faults can shear well casings and it is well known that fluid injection associated with water flooding operations can induce earthquakes, for reasons explained below.

Some stress paths associated with reservoir depletion can induce normal faulting.

The role of pore pressure of frictional sliding is introduced via σn, the effective normal stress, defined as (Sn − Pp), where Sn is the normal stress resolved onto the sliding plane.

There are only two things you need to know about friction. It is always 0.6, and it will always make a monkey out of you.

There are two things you need to know about life. It is shorter than you think and it will always make a monkey out of you.

In other words, as pore pressure gets higher and higher, faulting occurs with smaller and smaller differences between the maximum and minimum effective principal stress.

When stress magnitudes are controlled by the frictional strength of faults, as pore pressure increases, the maximum size of the Mohr circle decreases.

Hence, the Mohr circle gets smaller as pore pressures increases.

As pore pressure increases (and effective stress decreases), the difference between the maximum and minimum effective principal stress.

The first point worth emphasizing is that when the state of stress at depth is limited by the frictional strength of pre-existing faults, the ratio of effective stresses remains the same.

The first point worth emphasizing is that when the state of stress at depth is limited by the frictional strength of pre-existing faults, the ratio of effective stresses remains the same (in accord with equations 4.45, 4.46 and 4.47) as pore pressure changes (as.

Is convenient to be able to simply estimate the range of possible stress states at any given depth and pore pressure given that stress in the crust is limited by the frictional strength of faults.

Allowable values for horizontal principal stresses in the earth’s crust for normal, strike-slip and reverse faulting environments using equations.

Allowable stress states are shown for hydrostatic pore pressure (Figure 4.31a) and significant overpressure (Figure 4.31b). The.

The fact that SHmax  Shmin requires all possible stress states to be above a diagonal line of unit slope.

The vertical and horizontal lines intersecting at SHmax = Shmin = Sv separate the stress fields associated with normal (N), strike-slip (SS) and reverse (RF) faulting stress environments as defined by Anderson.

The vertical line in the lower left of the polygon indicates the lowest value of Shmin possible in a normal faulting environment as predicted using equation (4.45). In other words, for the value of Shmin shown by this line, a Mohr circle would exactly touch a frictional failure envelope with a slope of 0.6. Similarly, the horizontal line defining the top of the polygon corresponds the value of SHmax at which reverse faulting would occur (equation 4.47). The diagonal line bounding the polygon on the upper left corresponds to the value of SHmax at which strike-slip faulting would occur for a given value of Shmin (equation 4.46). Thus, in every case, the stress at depth must be somewhere within the stress polygon.

The fact that elevated pore pressure reduces the difference between principal stresses at depth as.

When pore pressure is elevated, all three principal stresses are close in magnitude to the vertical stress and relatively small changes in the stress field can cause a transition from one style of faulting to another. Moos and Zoback (1993) hypothesize that because of elevated pore pressure at depth in the vicinity of Long Valley caldera, the style of faulting goes from NF/SS faulting on one side of the caldera to RF/SS faulting on the other side as the direction of the horizontal principal stresses change.

The stress polygon shown in Figure 4.31a permits a very wide range of stress values at depth and would not seem to be of much practical use in limiting stress magnitudes. However, as extended leak-off tests.

The stress polygon shown in Figure 4.31a permits a very wide range of stress values at depth and would not seem to be of much practical use in limiting stress magnitudes. However, as extended leak-off tests or hydraulic fracturing tests are often available to provide a good estimate of the least principal stress (Chapter 6), the polygon is useful for estimating the possible range of values of SHmax.

One also has information about the existence of either compressive or tensile wellbore failures, one can often put relatively narrow (and hence, useful) bounds on possible stress states at depth.

The flow rate through a fracture in response to a pressure gradient will be proportional to the cube of the product of the length times the difference between the fluid pressure inside the fracture (acting to open it) and the least principal stress normal to it (acting to close it). This.

Following initiation, the pressure is expected to drop and the fractures to close.

Hence, only extremely small fracture apertures would be expected, having little effect on flow.

Wellbore imaging devices make it possible to obtain direct information on the distribution and orientation of fractures and faults encountered at depth. One family of wellbore image tools is collectively known as the ultrasonic borehole televiewer (BHTV). Such tools scan the wellbore wall with a centralized rotating ultrasonic.

Position around the well (with respect to north in this case) is shown on the abscissa and depth is shown on the ordinate. The amplitude of the reflected pulse is displayed as brightness.

Position around the well (with respect to north in this case) is shown on the abscissa and depth is shown on the ordinate. The amplitude of the reflected pulse is displayed as brightness. In such a display, planar fractures (or bedding planes) cutting the wellbore (Figure 5.3c) have a sinusoidal appearance (Figure 5.3d) resulting from the low amplitude of the reflected acoustic pulse along the intersection of the fault plane and wellbore wall.

Although wellbore image data only provide information on the apparent aperture of faults where they are intersected by a wellbore, empirical relations have been proposed that attempt to relate fault length to aperture (e.g. Gudmundsson 2000) and enable one to develop ideas about fracture networks from wellbore image data.

Thus, the apparent aperture is always going to be larger than the actual aperture.

One obvious limitation of imaging tools is that they will undersample fractures and faults whose planes are nearly parallel to the wellbore axis.

One obvious limitation of imaging tools is that they will undersample fractures and faults whose planes are nearly parallel to the wellbore axis. This is most easily visualized for a vertical well – the probability of intersecting horizontal fractures in the formation is one, but the probability of intersecting vertical fractures is essentially zero.

Dip is measured from a horizontal plane and is positive to the right, when looking in the strike direction.

Dip direction is often used instead of strike to define fracture orientation.

Measured from north, dip direction is the azimuth of the projection of a vector in the plane of the fault that is normal to the strike direction and points down dip. Slip on the fault is also defined by a vector, which can be thought of as the scratch on the footwall, resulting from relative motion of the hanging wall.

The concentration of stress around wellbores can lead to compressive failures known as stress-induced breakouts and/or tensile failure of the wellbore wall that we will refer to as drilling-induced tensile.

The concentration of stress around wellbores can lead to compressive failures known as stress-induced breakouts and/or tensile failure of the wellbore wall that we will refer to as drilling-induced tensile wall fractures.

Breakouts are quite common in many wells and yield important information about both stress orientation and magnitude.

The processes that control the initiation of tensile wall fractures are important for understanding the initiation of hydraulic fractures.

Hydrofracs are distinguished from tensile wall fractures in that they propagate from the wellbore into the far field, away from the wellbore stress concentration.

The concept of stress concentrations around a vertical well, how this stress concentration can lead to compressive and tensile wall failures and how such failures are used to determine the orientation of the horizontal principal stresses that exist in situ.

The determination of the least principal stress, S3, from hydrofracs in reservoirs or extended leak-off tests at casing set points. As S3  Shmin in normal and strike-slip faulting areas.

When one principal stress is vertical, Sv is obtained by integration of density logs as discussed in Chapter.

With knowledge of the orientation of the horizontal principal stresses obtained from wellbore failures and the magnitude Shmin, determination of the complete stress tensor requires only the magnitude of SHmax to be determined.

These include the way in which the presence of weak bedding planes can induce anisotropic rock strength.

Causes the stress trajectories to bend in such a way as to be parallel and perpendicular to the wellbore wall because it is a free surface which cannot sustain shear traction.

This is illustrated by the bunching up of stress trajectories at the azimuth of Shmin, which indicates strongly amplified compressive stress. In contrast, the spreading out of stress trajectories at the azimuth of SHmax indicates a decrease in compressive stress.

The most reliable way to observe wellbore breakouts is through the use of ultrasonic image logs that were described in Chapter 5.

This is because as ΔP increases, σθθ decreases and σrr increases such that the size of the Mohr circle (Figure 6.3b) decreases markedly in the area of the wellbore wall subjected to most compressive stress. This demonstrates why increasing mud weight can be used to stabilize wellbores, a subject to be considered at length in Chapter 10.

Drilling induced tensile fractures are not expected to propagate more than a cm from the wellbore wall.

Thus, the formation of drilling-induced tensile fractures will not lead to a hydraulic fracture propagating away from the wellbore (which could cause lost circulation) unless the mud weight exceeds the least principal stress. In the case of deviated wells,.

Breakouts are wellbore enlargements caused by stress-induced failure of a well occurring 180° apart. In vertical wells breakouts occur at the azimuth of minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) and generally (when analyzed properly) show a remarkably consistent orientation within a given well or field. One exception to this is localized perturbations of the stress field due to slip on active faults discussed in Chapter 11.

First, drilling-induced tensile fractures occur in vertical wells only when there is a significant difference between the two horizontal stresses. In fact, it is straightforward to show that the conditions for the occurrence of drilling-induced tensile fractures around a vertical wellbore in the absence of excess mud weight or wellbore cooling are essentially identical to the values of Shmin and SHmax associated with a strike-slip faulting regime in frictional equilibrium.

Breakouts form in the area around a wellbore where the stress concentration exceeds the rock strength.

There are other complexities affecting the formation of breakouts that will arise when we consider wellbore stability in Chapter 10: the effect of rock strength anisotropy that results from the presence of weak bedding planes in shale; the possibility that the strength of materials approach utilized here oversimplifies the breakout formation process; the relation between mud chemistry, rock strength and wellbore stability; other modes of breakout formation; and penetration of mud into fractured rock surrounding a wellbore.

Arriving at practical solutions to many problems in geomechanics requires knowledge of the magnitude and orientation of all three principal stresses.

In normal and strike-slip faulting environments,S3 is equivalent to Shmin. In reverse faulting environments, S3 is equivalent to Sv. Methods for determination of Shmin from Poisson’s ratio (obtained from P- and S-wave sonic logs) are based on questionable physical and geologic assumptions.

Suffice it to say at this point that direct measurement of the least principal stress through some form of hydraulic fracturing is the only reliable method known that is practical to use in wells and boreholes at any appreciable depth. One can determine the magnitude of the least principal stress from a micro-frac, a very small-scale hydraulic fracture induced only to measure stress at a particular depth, usually at a specific depth through perforations in cemented casing.

Production. One can also determine the least principal stress from a leak-off test: after the casing has been cemented in place at a given depth and the well is drilled a short distance (usually 10–20 ft) the open section of the well is pressurized to the point that a hydraulic fracture is created, and the magnitude of the least principal stress can be determined.

Presented a compelling physical argument that hydraulic fractures in the earth will always propagate perpendicular to the orientation of the least principal stress, S3. Because the work done to open a Mode I fracture a given amount is proportional to the product of the stress acting perpendicular to the fracture plane times the amount of opening (i.e. work is equal to force times distance), hydraulic fractures will always propagate perpendicular to the least principal stress because it is the least energy configuration.

In strike-slip and normal faulting environments where S3  Shmin, hydraulic fracture (and dike) propagation will be in a vertical plane perpendicular to Shmin (and parallel to SHmax). In reverse faulting environments where S3  Sv, hydraulic fracture propagation will be in a horizontal plane.

The wellbore pressure required to initiate a tensile fracture is greater than the least principal stress so that the pressure drops after fracture initiation.

The LOP is not reached, a limit test, or formation integrity test (LT, or FIT), is said to have been conducted. Such tests merely indicate that at the maximum pressure achieved, the fluid pressure did not propagate away from the wellbore wall, either because the maximum wellbore pressure did not exceed the least principal stress or was not sufficient to initiate a fracture of the wellbore wall in the case of an open-hole test.

An even better measure of the least principal stress is obtained from the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) which is measured after abruptly stopping flow into the well, because any pressure associated with friction due to viscous pressure losses disappears.

Influence of weak bedding planes on wellbore stability as they introduce anisotropic rock strength which can affect the stability of wells drilled at particular angles to the bedding planes.

By reactive shales we mean those that chemically react with drilling mud in such a way as to weaken a formation leading to wellbore instability.

We illustrate the importance of this in two very different cases: one where near-vertical wells were being drilled in steeply dipping strata and the other where highly deviated wells were being drilled through relatively flat-laying shales.

The first is how reservoir depletion and drawdown (related to the rate of production) affect open-hole completions in wells of different orientations.

An unstable well is one in which excess breakout formation produces so much failed material from around the wellbore that the total volume of cuttings and failed material in the hole cannot be circulated out by mud circulation.

Hence, a breakout with limited breakout width, 60° in the example shown in Figure 10.1a, produces a failed zone of limited size. Literally thousands of near-vertical wells have been.

.

The most unstable orientations (horizontal wells drilled parallel to either SHmax or Shmin) require a mud weight that balances the pore pressure.

For the case of strike-slip faulting (SHmax = 105 MPa, Sv = 70 MPa, Shmin = 45 MPa) shown in Figure 10.4b, it is clear that for all orientations except highly deviated wells parallel to SHmax, mud weights of 40–42 MPa (corresponding to 1.28 sg or 10.7 ppg) are required to achieve the desired degree of stability. As the stresses are both larger in magnitude and more anisotropic than for the normal faulting case, the well trajectory has a more important effect on wellbore stability. For the case of reverse faulting (SHmax = 145 MPa, Shmin = 125 MPa, Sv = 70 MPa) shown in Figure 10.4c, still higher mud weights are needed at all wellbore orientations because of the very high stress magnitudes. The most unstable wells (i.e. those requiring the highest mud weights) are near vertical (deviations <30°) and require 52 MPa (1.62 sg or 13.7 ppg) to achieve the desired degree of wellbore stability. Lower mud weights can be used to achieve the desired degree of stability whenever the well trajectories are more highly deviated. The most stable wells are those that are highly deviated and drilled in the direction of SHmax.

At a certain depth, the well could not be drilled any further (and did not reach its intended target reservoir) because mud weights sufficient to stabilize the well exceeded the least principal stress. In other words, as the operator increased the mud weight in an attempt to stabilize failure of the wellbore wall, circulation was lost because the mud weight exceeded the least principal stress.

The reason drilling direction is so important in this case study is that at the depth of interest there is a significant difference between the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stresses. While Shmin is well below Sv, as expected in this area of active normal faulting, SHmax was found to be approximately equal to Sv.

In this case study for an offshore Gulf of Mexico well, near vertical wells and those deviated to the northwest or southeast require unrealistically high mud weights (i.e. in excess of the frac gradient) to achieve an acceptable degree of wellbore stability. In contrast, wells that are highly deviated to the southwest or northeast are relatively stable.

The most stable drilling direction is parallel to SHmax (100°/280°) with a high deviation (near-horizontal). The horizontal well drilled at an azimuth.

# India's  Ancient Past (Sharma, R.S.)

The author discusses the rise of Jainism and Buddhism, Magadha and the beginning of territorial states, and the period of Mauryas, Central Asian countries, Satvahanas, Guptas, and Harshavardhana.

Withdrew the book because of extreme conservatism.

Iranian inscriptions are important for the origin of the term Hindu. The term Hindu occurs in the inscriptions of fifth–sixth centuries BC. It is derived from the Sanskrit term Sindhu. Linguistically s becomes h in Iranian. The Iranian inscriptions first mention Hindu as a district on the Indus. Therefore, in the earliest stage, the term Hindu means a territorial unit. It neither indicates a religion nor a community.

The pre-Aryans, the Indo-Aryans, the Greeks, the Scythians, the Hunas, the Turks, and others made India their home.

Peninsular and non-Vedic India.

Tamil texts called the Sangam literature.

Ancient India saw the birth of Brahmanism or Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, but all these cultures and religions intermingled and interacted.

Thus, though Indians speak different languages, practise different religions, and observe different social customs, they follow certain common styles of life. Our country shows a deep underlying unity despite great diversity.

The country as a whole came to be named Aryavarta after the dominant cultural community called the Aryans.

The other name by which India was better known was Bharatavarsha or the land of the Bharatas. Bharata, in the sense of tribe or family, figures in the Rig Veda and Mahabharata, but the name Bharatavarsha occurs in the Mahabharata and post-Gupta Sanskrit texts.

The term Bharati or an inhabitant of India occurs in post-Gupta texts.

This form of political unity was attained at least twice in ancient times. In the third century BC Ashoka extended his empire over the whole of India barring the extreme south.

They first came into contact with the people living on the Sindhu or the Indus, and so they named the entire country after this river.

They first came into contact with the people living on the Sindhu or the Indus, and so they named the entire country after this river. The word Hind or Hindu is derived from the Sanskrit term Sindhu, and on the same basis, the country became known as ‘India’ which is very close to the Greek term for it.

Efforts to establish linguistic and cultural unity in India. In the third century BC Prakrit served as the lingua franca across the major part of India. Ashoka’s inscriptions were inscribed in the Prakrit language mainly in Brahmi script.

Some people clamour for the restoration of ancient culture and civilization, and a substantial number are sentimentally swayed by what they consider to be the past glories of India.

There is no doubt that Indians of old made remarkable progress in a variety of fields, but these advances alone cannot enable us to compete with the achievements of modern science and technology.

There is no doubt that Indians of old made remarkable progress in a variety of fields, but these advances alone cannot enable us to compete with the achievements of modern science and technology. We cannot ignore the fact that ancient Indian society was marked by gross social injustice. The lower orders, particularly the shudras and untouchables, were encumbered with disabilities which are shocking to the modern mind. Similarly, law and custom discriminate against women in favour of men. The restoration of the old way of life will naturally revive and strengthen all these inequities. The success of the ancients in surmounting the difficulties presented by nature and human factors can build our hope and confidence in the future but any attempt to bring back the past will mean a perpetuation of the social inequity that afflicted India. All this makes it essential for us to understand what the past means.

Reason we don't want old way of life.

Modern research in the history of ancient India began only in the second half of the eighteenth century to serve the needs of the British colonial administration. When Bengal and Bihar fell under the rule of the East India Company in 1765, they found it difficult to administer the Hindu law of inheritance. Therefore, in 1776, the Manu Smriti, (the law-book of Manu), which was considered authoritative, was translated into English as A Code of Gentoo Laws.

Bhagvadgita, the most popular Hindu religious text was translated into English by Wilkins in 1785. The Bombay Asiatic Society was set up in 1804, and the Asiatic Society of Great Britain was set up in London in 1823.

The initial efforts to understand ancient laws and customs, which continued largely until the eighteenth century, culminated in the establishment in Calcutta in 1784 of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It was set up by a civil servant of the East India Company, Sir William Jones (1746–94). He was the first to suggest that Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek belonged to the same family of languages.

The Revolt of 1857 caused Britain to realize that it badly needed a deeper knowledge of the manners and social systems of an alien people over whom it ruled.

British interpretations of Indian history served to denigrate the Indian character and achievements, and justify colonial rule.

Generalizations made by colonialist historians were by and large either false or grossly exaggerated, but served as good propaganda material for the perpetuation of the despotic British rule.

Rajendra Lal Mitra (1822–91), who published some Vedic texts and wrote a book entitled Indo-Aryans. A great lover of ancient heritage, he took a rational view of ancient society and produced a forceful tract to show that in ancient times people ate beef. Others sought to prove that in spite of its peculiarities, the caste system was not basically different from the class system based on division of labour found in Europe’s pre-industrial and ancient societies.

R.G. Bhandarkar reconstructed the political history of the Satavahanas of the Deccan and the history of Vaishnavism and other sects.

The Indian scholars diligently studied polity and political history to demonstrate that India did have a political history and that the Indians possessed expertise in administration.

Those who wrote history at a pan-India level were inspired by the ideas of nationalism.

On the other hand, they stressed the importance of the dialogue of Porus with Alexander and Chandragupta Maurya’s liberation of north-western India from Seleucus.

Over the past forty years there has been a sea change in the methods and orientation of those who work on ancient India. They lay greater stress on social, economic, and cultural processes, and try to relate them to political developments.

The methods of archaeology help us to recover the material remains of the past, relating to ancient, medieval, and modern periods of our history.

Archaeology is used to study prehistory and ancient history.

Prehistory is concerned with the period for which there are no written sources, and history is basically based on written material.

They show the layout of the settlements in which people lived, the types of pottery they used, the form of house in which they dwelt, the kind of cereals they ate, and the type of tools and implements they used. Some people in south India buried in graves, along with the dead, their tools, weapons, pottery, and other belongings, and these were encircled by large pieces of stone. These structures are called megaliths, although some megaliths do not fall in this category.

When an object is living, the process of decay of C14 is neutralized by absorption of C14 through air and food. However, when an object ceases to be alive, its C14 content continues to decay.

Radiocarbon or Carbon 14 (C14) is a radioactive carbon (isotope) which is present in all living objects. It decays, like all radioactive substances, at a uniform rate. When an object is living, the process of decay of C14 is neutralized by absorption of C14 through air and food. However, when an object ceases to be alive, its C14 content continues to decay at a uniform rate but ceases to absorb C14 from air and food. By measuring the loss of C14 content in an ancient object, its age can be determined.

But no antiquity older than 70,000 years can be dated by this method.

The history of climate and vegetation is known through an examination of plant residues, and especially through pollen analysis.

The study of coins is called numismatics.

Far more important than coins are inscriptions. Their study is called epigraphy, and the study of the old writing used in inscriptions and other old records is called palaeography.

Like coins, inscriptions are preserved in various museums of the country, but the largest number may be found in the office of the chief epigraphist at Mysore.

The earliest inscriptions were written in Prakrit in the third century.

Most Ashokan inscriptions were engraved in the Brahmi script, which was written from left to right, but some were also incised in the Kharoshthi script which was written from right to left.

Although the ancient Indians knew how to write as early as 2500 BC, our most ancient manuscripts are not older than the AD fourth century and are found in Central Asia.

In India, they were written on birch bark and palm leaves, but in Central Asia, where the Prakrit language had spread from India, manuscripts were also written on sheep leather and wooden tablets.

Inscriptions are largely preserved in museums, and manuscripts in libraries.

Originally, it consisted of 8800 verses and was called Jaya or a collection dealing with victory. These were increased to 24,000 and came to be known as Bharata because it contains the stories of the descendants of one of the earliest Vedic tribes called Bharata. The final compilation increased the verses to 100,000 which came to be known as the Mahabharata or the Shatasahasri Samhita.

As a whole, the text seems to have been composed later than the Mahabharata.

The earliest Buddhist texts were written in Pali, which was spoken in Magadha or south Bihar, and was basically a form of Prakrit.

The most important and interesting portion of the non-canonical literature is provided by the stories of the previous births of Gautama Buddha. It was believed that before he was actually born as Gautama, the Buddha passed through over 550 births, in many cases in the form of animals. Each birth story is called a Jataka, which is a folk tale.

This literature was produced over a period of three to four centuries by poets who assembled in colleges patronized by chiefs and kings. Such colleges were called Sangam, and the literature produced in these assemblies was known as Sangam literature.

The Sangam texts are different from the Vedic texts, particularly the Rig Veda. They do not constitute religious literature. The short and long poems were composed by numerous poets in praise of various heroes and heroines and are thus secular in nature. They are not primitive songs, but literature of high quality. Many poems mention a warrior or a chief or a king by name and describe in detail his military exploits. The gifts made by him to bards and warriors are celebrated. These poems may have been recited in the courts. They are compared with the heroic poetry of the Homeric age, for they represent a heroic age of warriors and battles. It is difficult to use these texts for historical purposes. Perhaps the proper names, titles, dynasties, territories, wars, and the like mentioned in the poems are partly real.

It is remarkable that Alexander’s invasion finds no mention in Indian sources, and it is entirely on the basis of the Greek sources that we have to reconstruct the history of his Indian exploits.

Relics of communal sharing in feasts, festivals, and pujas throw light on the egalitarian character of ancient tribal society.

The Puranas speak of four ages called krita, treta, dvapara, and kali. Each succeeding age is depicted as worse than the preceding one, and as one age slides into the other, moral values and social institutions degenerate.

Ashoka ruled for thirty-seven years.

On chronological and rational grounds, archaeology, inscriptions, and coins are more important than texts.

The term hundreds of thousands seems to be a cliché in Ashokan inscriptions.

The term hundreds of thousands seems to be a cliché in Ashokan inscriptions. It is applied to people and animals, and raises doubts about the number of the people killed in the Kalinga war and those brought to Pataliputra.

Earlier, Gondwanaland, together with the northern super-continent Laurisia, comprising North America, Greenland, Europe, and most of Asia north of the Himalayas, formed a single land mass called Pangaea.

This process began around 225 million years ago, and 40 million years ago India became a separate unit.

The last and the final uplift took place in the Pleistocene epoch, that is, in c. 2 million–12000 BC.

The subcontinent is divided into five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan. India has nearly 1000,000,000 people. It comprises twenty-eight states and seven union territories, including the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Some of its states are larger than many European countries.

What is known today as the kharif crop in north India depended primarily in ancient times on the south-west monsoon.

A part of the peninsular India, particularly the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, gets its major rainfall from the north-east monsoon from mid-October to mid-December.

The Himalayas protect the country against the cold arctic winds blowing from Siberia through Central Asia.

Sulaiman ranges are joined southward in Baluchistan by the Kiarthar ranges which could be crossed through the Bolan pass. Through these passes, two-way traffic between India and Central Asia has continued from prehistoric times onwards. Various peoples from Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia came to India as invaders and immigrants, and vice versa. Even the Hindu Kush, the westward extension of the Himalayan system, did not form an insuperable barrier between the Indus and the Oxus systems. The passes facilitated trade and cultural contacts between India, on the one hand, and Central Asia and West Asia, on the other.

The Sarasvati, coterminous with the Ghagar–Hakara, was joined by the Yamuna and the Sutlej, and the three together contributed to the growth of the Harappan culture. However, in 1700 BC, the Sutlej, and possibly the Yamuna, moved eastward, adversely affecting post-urban Harappan settlements.

Nevertheless, an almost complete hominid skull was discovered in 1982 in the middle valley of the Narmada at Hathnora in MP. This fossilized skull was called Homo erectus or upright human, but is now anatomically recognized as archaic Homo sapiens.

Modern humans are considered 34,000 years old. In any case it seems that the earliest modern humans arrived in India from the South because of an early coastal migration around 50,000 years ago from Africa. They did not come from the North.

In the introductions to these volumes and the books based on them, Max Mueller and other Western scholars made certain generalizations about the nature of ancient Indian history and society. They stated that the ancient Indians lacked a sense of history, especially of the element of time and chronology. They added that Indians were accustomed to despotic rule, and also natives were so engrossed in the problems of spiritualism or of the next world that they felt no concern about the problems of this world. The Western scholars stressed that Indians had experienced neither a sense of nationhood nor any form of self-government.

Early History of India by Vincent Arthur Smith (1843–1920), who wrote in 1904 the first systematic history of ancient India.

Similarly, if Indians were obsessed with the problems of the next world, the British colonial masters had no option but to look after their life in this world.

At the heart of all such generalizations lay the need to demonstrate that Indians were incapable of governing themselves. Nationalist.

In the context of religion, neither Hindu nor Hindu dharma is known to any ancient Sanskrit text nor to any other ancient source. The communal writers go on harping on Hindu and Hindutva. Under the circumstances, historians wedded to objective and scientific criteria have to be alert and adhere to reason and long established historical standards.

This can be supplemented by the account of the Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang, who visited India in the seventh century and stayed in the country for about fifteen years. Harsha’s inscriptions speak of various types of taxes and officials.

The Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang informs us that Harsha’s revenues were divided into four parts. One part was earmarked for the expenditure of the king, a second for scholars, a third for the endowment of officials and public servants, and a fourth for religious purposes.

He also tells us that ministers and high officers of the state were endowed with land. The feudal practice of rewarding and paying officers with grants of land seems to have begun under Harsha. This explains why we do not have very many coins issued by this king. In Harsha’s empire, law and order was not well maintained. Hsuan Tsang, about whose welfare, special care may have been taken by the government, was robbed of his belongings, although he reports that according to the laws of the land, severe punishments were inflicted for crime. Robbery was considered to be a second treason for which the right hand of the robber was amputated. It however appears that, under the influence of Buddhism, the severity of punishment was mitigated and criminals were imprisoned for life.

It however appears that, under the influence of Buddhism, the severity of punishment was mitigated and criminals were imprisoned for life. The reign of Harsha is historically important because of the visit of the Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang, who left China in AD 629 and travelled all the way to India. After a long stay in India, he returned to China in AD 645. He had come to study at the Buddhist university of Nalanda situated in the district of the same name in Bihar and to collect Buddhist texts from India. The pilgrim spent many years in Harsha’s court and travelled widely in India. Under his influence Harsha became a great supporter of Buddhism and made generous endowments to it. The pilgrim vividly describes Harsha’s court and life in those days, and this account is richer and more reliable than that of Fa-hsien, shedding light on the social and economic life as well as the religious sects of the period.

The Chinese account shows that Pataliputra was in a state of decline, as was Vaishali. On the other hand, Prayag and Kanauj in the doab had become important. The brahmanas and kshatriyas are reported to have led a simple life, but the nobles and priests led a luxurious life. This indicates differentiation in the ranks of each of the two higher varnas. The majority in each of them may have taken to agriculture. Hsuan Tsang calls the shudras agriculturists, which is significant. The earlier texts represent them as serving the three higher varnas. The Chinese pilgrim notes the living conditions of the untouchables such as scavengers, and executioners. The untouchables lived outside the villages, and ate garlic and onion, and when they entered the town, they announced their entry by shouting loudly so that people might keep away from them.

The Buddhists were divided into eighteen sects when the Chinese pilgrim was in India. The old centres of Buddhism had fallen on bad days. The most famous centre was Nalanda, which maintained a great Buddhist university meant for Buddhist monks. It is said to have had as many as 10,000 students, all monks. They were taught Buddhist philosophy of the Mahayana school. Although all the mounds of Nalanda have not been dug, excavations have exposed a very impressive complex of buildings. These were raised and renovated over a period of 700 years from the fifth century onwards. The buildings exposed by excavations do not have the capacity to accommodate 10,000 monks. In AD 670, another Chinese pilgrim, I-tsing, visited Nalanda, and he mentions that only 3000 monks lived there. This is reasonable because, even if the remaining mounds are excavated, the buildings cannot have been sufficiently spacious to have accommodated 10,000 monks. According to Hsuan Tsang, the monastery at Nalanda was supported from the revenues of 100 villages. I-tsing raises this number to 200. Nalanda thus had a huge monastic establishment during the reign of Harshavardhana.

The Indian numerals are called Arabic in English, but the Arabs themselves called their numerals hinds, and before they were adopted in the West they had been used in India for centuries.

Vardhamana Mahavira, who really founded Jainism, and Gautama Buddha, who founded Buddhism, belonged to the kshatriya clan, and both disputed the authority of the brahmanas.

Given the moist nature of the soil in this area, not many iron tools of the earliest times have survived, but a fair number of axes have been found from the layers of c. 600–500 BC. The use of iron tools made possible clearance, agriculture, and large settlements. The agricultural economy based on the iron ploughshare required the use of bullocks, and could not flourish without animal husbandry.

First, Jainism and Buddhism at the initial stage did not attach any importance to the existing varna system.

Second, they preached the gospel of non-violence, which would put an end to wars between different kingdoms and consequently promote trade and commerce.

Third, the brahmanical law-books, called the Dharmasutras, decried lending money at an interest, and condemned those who lived on interest. Therefore, the vaishyas, who lent money because of the growing trade and commerce, were held in low esteem and looked for better social status.

Against various forms of private property. Old-fashioned people did not like the use and accumulation of coins made certainly of silver and copper and possibly of gold. They disliked the new dwellings and clothes, new luxurious systems of transport, and disliked war and violence. The new forms of property created social inequalities, and caused misery and suffering to the mass of ordinary people. Therefore, the common people yearned to return to a primitive lifestyle, to the ascetic ideal which dispensed with the new forms of property and the new style of life. Both Jainism and Buddhism propounded simple, puritan, ascetic living.

The Jainas believed that their most important religious teacher Mahavira had twenty-three predecessors who were called tirthankaras.

If Mahavira is taken as the last or the twenty-fourth tirthankara, the origin of Jainism would go back to the ninth century BC.

His father Siddhartha was the head of a famous kshatriya clan, and his mother, Trishala, was the sister of the Lichchhavi chief Chetaka, whose daughter was married to Bimbisara. Thus, Mahavira’s family was connected with the royal family of Magadh, and such high connections made it easy for him to approach princes and nobles in the course of his mission.

He propagated his religion for thirty years, and his mission took him to Koshala, Magadha, Mithila, Champa, and elsewhere.

He propagated his religion for thirty years, and his mission took him to Koshala, Magadha, Mithila, Champa, and elsewhere. He passed away at the age of 72 in 468 BC at a place called Pavapuri near modern Rajgir.

Jainism taught five doctrines: (i) do not commit violence, (ii) do not tell a lie, (iii) do not steal, (iv) do not hoard, and (v) observe continence (brahmacharya). It is said that only the fifth doctrine was added by Mahavira: the other four were taken over by him from previous teachers. Jainism attached the utmost importance to ahimsa or non-injury to living beings.

Jainism recognized the existence of the gods but placed them lower than the jina, and did not condemn the varna system as Buddhism did.

Difference from Buddhism.

Jainism recognized the existence of the gods but placed them lower than the jina, and did not condemn the varna system as Buddhism did. According to Mahavira, a person is born in a high or in a lower varna as a consequence of his sins committed or virtues acquired by him in his previous birth.

It can be obtained through right knowledge, right faith, and right action. These three are considered to be the three jewels or triratna of Jainism.

Jainism prohibited the practice of war and even agriculture for its followers because both involve the killing of living beings. Eventually the Jainas principally confined themselves to trade and mercantile activities.

In order to spread the teachings of Jainism, Mahavira organized an order of his followers that admitted both men and women. He preached his teachings in Prakrit, the language of the common people.

According to a late tradition, the spread of Jainism in Karnataka is attributed to Chandragupta Maurya (322– 298 BC). The emperor became a Jaina, gave up his throne, and spent the last years of his life in Karnataka as a Jaina ascetic, but this tradition is not corroborated by any other source.

The second cause of the spread of Jainism in south India is said to have been the great famine that took place in Magadha 200 years after Mahavira’s death. The famine lasted for twelve years, and in order to protect themselves, many Jainas migrated to the south under the leadership of Bhadrabahu, though the rest of them stayed back in Magadha under the leadership of Sthalabahu. The emigrant Jainas spread Jainism in south India. At the end of the famine, they returned to Magadha, where they developed differences with the local Jainas. Those who returned from the south claimed that even during the famine they had strictly observed the religious rules. They alleged too that the Jaina ascetics living in Magadha had violated those rules and had become lax. In order to sort out these differences and to compile the principal teachings of Jainism, a council was convened in Pataliputra, modern Patna, but the Jainas who had returned from the south boycotted it and refused to accept its decisions. From now onwards, the southerns began to be called digambaras and the Magadhans shvetambaras. The tradition that refers to drought as the cause relates to a later period and is considered doubtful. It is, however, beyond doubt that the Jainas were divided into two sects, but epigraphic evidence of the spread of Jainism in Karnataka is not earlier than the third century AD.

Jainism spread to Kalinga in Orissa in the fourth century BC, and in the first century BC it enjoyed the patronage of the Kalinga king Kharavela who had defeated the princes of Andhra and Magadha. In the second and first centuries BC, it also seems to have reached the southern districts of Tamil Nadu. In later centuries Jainism penetrated Malwa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, and even now these areas have a substantial number of Jainas who are principally engaged in trade and commerce.

Jainism made the first serious attempt to mitigate the evils of the varna order and the ritualistic Vedic religion.

Their religious literature was written in Ardhamagadhi, and the texts were eventually compiled in the sixth century AD in Gujarat at a place called Valabhi, a geat centre of education.

Initially, like the Buddhists, the Jainas were not image worshippers. Later they began to worship Mahavira and also the twenty-three tirthankaras.

Gautama Buddha, or Siddhartha, was a contemporary of Mahavira. According to tradition he was born in 567 BC in a Shakya kshatriya family in Lumbini in Nepal near Kapilavastu, which is identified with Piprahwa in Basti district and is close to the foothills of Nepal.

His mother was a princess from the Koshalan dynasty.

At the age of 29, like Mahavira, he left home. He wandered from place to place for about seven years and then attained enlightenment at the age of 35 at Bodh-Gaya under a pipal tree.

Gautama Buddha delivered his first sermon at Sarnath in Banaras.

He did not involve himself in fruitless controversies regarding the soul (atman) and Brahma which raged in his time, but addressed himself to worldly problems.

He said that the world was full of sorrows and that people suffered on account of desires. If desires are conquered, nirvana is attained, that is, man is free from the cycle of birth and death.

Gautama Buddha recommended an eightfold path (ashtangika marga) for the elimination of human misery. This path is attributed to him in a text of about the third century BC. It comprised right observation, right determination, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right awareness, and right concern. If a person follows this eightfold path, he would free himself from the machinations of priests, and would reach his destination. Gautama taught that a person should avoid an excess of both luxury and austerity, and prescribed the middle path.

The principal tenets are: (i) do not commit violence, (ii) do not covet the property of others, (iii) do not use intoxicants, (iv) do not tell a lie, and (v) do not indulge in sexual misconduct and adultery. These teachings are common to the social conduct ordained by virtually all religions. Features.

The people of Magadha responded readily to Buddhism because they were looked down upon by the orthodox brahmanas.

The old tradition persists, and the people of north Bihar prefer not to be cremated south of the Ganges in Magadha.

He maintained his poise and calm under difficult circumstances and tackled his opponents with wit and presence of mind. It is said that on one occasion an ignorant person abused him. The Buddha listened on silently, and when the person had ended his abuse, the Buddha asked: ‘My friend, if a person does not accept a present what will happen to it?’ His adversary replied: ‘It remains with the person who has offered it.’ The Buddha then said: ‘My friend, I do not accept your abuse.’.

Gautama Buddha also organized the sangha or the religious order, whose doors were open to all irrespective of caste, creed, and sex. However, slaves, soldiers, and debtors could not be admitted.

There are thus three principal elements in Buddhism: Buddha, dhamma, and sangha.

Two hundred years after the death of the Buddha, Ashoka, the famous Maurya king, embraced Buddhism. This was an epoch-making event. Through his missionaries Ashoka spread Buddhism into Central Asia, West Asia, and Sri Lanka, and thus transformed it into a world religion. Even today Sri Lanka, Burma (Myanmar), Tibet, and parts of China and Japan profess Buddhism. Although Buddhism disappeared from the land of its birth, it continues to hold ground in the countries of South Asia, South east Asia, and East Asia.

We find that at the outset every religion is inspired by the spirit of reform, but eventually it succumbs to the rituals and ceremonies it originally denounces.

The Buddha is reported to have said to his favourite disciple Ananda: ‘If women were not admitted into the monasteries Buddhism would have continued for one thousand years, but because this admission has been granted it will last only five hundred years.’.

The brahmana ruler Pashyamitra Shunga is said to have persecuted the Buddhists. Several instances of persecution occur in the sixth–seventh centuries. The Huna king Mihirakula, who was a worshipper of Shiva, killed hundreds of Buddhists. The Shaivite Shashanka of Gauda felled the Bodhi tree at Bodh-Gaya where the Buddha had attained enlightenment. Hsuan Tsang states that 1600 stupas and monasteries were destroyed, and thousands of monks and lay followers killed; this may not be without some truth. The Buddhist reaction can be seen in some pantheons in which Buddhist deities trample brahmanical deities. In south India both the Shaivites and Vaishnavites bitterly opposed the Jainas and Buddhists in early medieval times. Such conflicts may have weakened Buddhism.

The earliest Buddhist text, Suttanipata, declares cattle to be givers of food, beauty, strength, and happiness (annada, vannada, balada, sukhada), and thus pleads for their protection.

Mention may be made of Nalanda and Vikramashila in Bihar, and Valabhi in Gujarat.

The term for family (kula) is rarely mentioned in the Rig Veda. It comprised not only mother, father, sons, slaves, etc., but many other people too. It seems that family in the early Vedic phase was denoted by the term griha, which frequently occurs in this text.


# Astrophysics for People in a Hurry (Neil DeGrasse Tyson)

At one time or another every one of us has looked up at the night sky and wondered: What does it all mean? How does it all work? And, what is my place in the universe?.

In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence.

With the weak force controlling radioactive decay, the strong force binding the atomic nucleus, the electromagnetic force binding molecules, and gravity binding bulk matter.

That small difference in population would hardly get noticed by anybody amid the continuous creation, annihilation, and re-creation of quarks and antiquarks, electrons and antielectrons (better known as positrons), and neutrinos and antineutrinos. The.

This tepid universe was no longer hot enough or dense enough to cook quarks, and so they all grabbed dance partners, creating a permanent new family of heavy particles called hadrons (from the Greek hadros, meaning “thick”). That quark-to-hadron transition soon resulted in the emergence of protons and neutrons as well as other, less familiar heavy particles, all composed of various combinations of quark species. In Switzerland (back on Earth) the European particle physics collaboration† uses a large accelerator to collide beams of hadrons in an attempt to re-create these very conditions. This largest machine in the world is sensibly called the Large Hadron Collider.

Or what if everything we know and love were just a computer simulation rendered for entertainment by a superintelligent alien species?.

It happens that we cannot see, touch, or taste the source of eighty-five percent of the gravity we measure in the universe.

Dwarf galaxies have three things working against their detection: They are small, and so are easily passed over when seductive spiral galaxies vie for your attention. They are dim, and so are missed in many surveys of galaxies that cut off below a prespecified brightness level. And they have a low density of stars within them, so they offer poor contrast above the glow of surrounding light from Earth’s nighttime atmosphere and from other sources.

We don’t know who’s next in the genius sequence, but we’ve now been waiting nearly a century for somebody to tell us why the bulk of all the gravitational force that we’ve measured in the universe—about eighty-five percent of it—arises from substances that do not otherwise interact with “our” matter or energy. Or maybe the excess gravity doesn’t come from matter and energy at all, but emanates from some other conceptual thing. In any case, we are essentially clueless.

Cosmic dark matter has about six times the total gravity of all the visible matter.

Most of the dark matter—hence, most of the mass in the universe—does not participate in nuclear fusion, which disqualifies it as “ordinary” matter, whose essence lies in a willingness to participate in the atomic and nuclear forces that shape matter as we know it.

If all mass has gravity, does all gravity have mass?.

Gravity wants to make stuff coagulate, but the expansion wants to dilute it.

Ultimately, one of its twentieth-century scientists would invent relativity out of his head, and predict the existence of gravitational waves. A century later, technology capable of seeing these waves would finally catch up with the prediction, just days before that gravity wave, which had been traveling for 1.3 billion years, washed over Earth and was detected. Yes, Einstein was a badass.

“Matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to move.”††††.

Yes, we’re clueless. But it’s not abject cluelessness. Dark energy is not adrift, with nary a theory to anchor it. Dark energy inhabits one of the safest harbors we can imagine: Einstein’s equations of general relativity. It’s the cosmological constant. It’s lambda. Whatever dark energy turns out to be, we already know how to measure it and how to calculate its effects on the past, present, and future of the cosmos. Without a doubt, Einstein’s greatest blunder was having declared that lambda was his greatest blunder.

In a trillion or so years, anyone alive in our own galaxy may know nothing of other galaxies. Our observable universe will merely comprise a system of nearby, long-lived stars within the Milky Way. And beyond this starry night will lie an endless void—darkness in the face of the deep.

How else could we believe that sodium is a poisonous, reactive metal that you can cut with a butter knife, while pure chlorine is a smelly, deadly gas, yet when added together they make sodium chloride, a harmless, biologically essential compound better known as table salt? Or how about hydrogen and oxygen? One is an explosive gas, and the other promotes violent combustion, yet the two combined make liquid water, which puts out fires.

Another prediction of big bang cosmology is that we can expect no more than one percent of the atoms in any region of the universe to be lithium. No one has yet found a galaxy with more lithium than this upper limit supplied by the big bang. The combination of helium’s upper limit and lithium’s lower limit gives a potent dual-constraint on tests for big bang cosmology.

Any element. This means something quite simple: if you split iron atoms via fission, they will absorb energy. And if you combine iron atoms via fusion, they will also absorb energy. Stars, however, are in the business of making energy. As high-mass stars manufacture and accumulate iron in their cores, they are nearing death.

Every form of the element technetium is radioactive. Not surprisingly, it’s found nowhere on Earth except in particle accelerators, where we make it on demand. Technetium carries this distinction in its name, which derives from the Greek technetos, meaning “artificial.” For reasons not yet fully understood, technetium lives in the atmospheres of a select subset of red stars. This alone would not be cause for alarm except that technetium has a half-life of a mere two million years, which is much, much shorter than the age and life expectancy of the stars in which it is found. In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were, there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star’s core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community.

Alas, Saturn, my favorite planet,†† has no element named for it, but Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are famously represented.

# The Dating Playbook For Men: A Proven 7 Step System To Go From Single To The Woman Of Your Dreams (Ferebee, Andrew)

Women do not like it when they feel like a man is trying to “get” something from them.

The more you value yourself, the more women will value you. If you respect yourself, then others will respect you — it’s that simple.

It is very attractive to a woman when a man is unaffected by a woman’s actions and emotions. Be a mountain, not a leaf in the wind, as they say.

If you are overly needy or clingy, you will lose the girl. You must have something more important going on in your life than the woman — your purpose, your goals, your ambition.

The goal of having complete self-reliance in your life is to remove the need for validation from others and to be less invested in others than you are in yourself.

Let me tell you, and emphasize it, if you are unhappy in this moment, no one did it to you. You are doing it to yourself, even in this moment. Something unfortunate may have happened to you in the past, but you are the one who continuously punishes yourself and suffers as a result.

The ultimate goal of The Grounded Man is to become self-reliant; to become your true self, to love all of your flaws and imperfections, and be one hundred percent happy with who you are in this moment.

And further, I want to make this crystal clear: no woman will ever make you happy if you are first not happy with yourself. Not being true to yourself will only create pain in your life, for most you will have sacrificed what makes you happy in order to please society, friends, or family.

Happy. And further, I want to make this crystal clear: no woman will ever make you happy if you are first not happy with yourself.

“A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”.

Become a more interesting person. Make your opinions known. Try things most people haven’t done. Go places where others haven’t been. Try new things, do things differently, read more books. Life is meant to be lived, not watched through a 55-inch LCD screen.

Read the classics of philosophy by Aristotle, Seneca, and Epictetus. Listen to different styles of music and learn to appreciate art.

Travel more. You need to experience the world to be fully grounded. Traveling is, in fact, the fastest way to become a more grounded man. All of the interesting men I’ve met have traveled the world extensively.

Adopt the mindset of ABL, which stands for: always be learning. Wherever you are there can be something to learn. Whether you’re in traffic, walking to your car, or in the gym working out. I’m not just talking about listening to a podcast or an audio program, but I’m talking about viewing the world through the lens of a student. Someone with fresh, innocent eyes. This one trick will make the world a much more interesting place, and boring locations suddenly become areas of pleasure.

Although a woman wants to be the only important thing in a man’s life, at her core, she doesn’t really want to be. She’ll never tell you this, but she doesn’t want to be the main reason why you get up in the morning. Rather, she wants you to live your purpose, your values, and have your own life outside of hers. She wants to come along for the adventure that you bring to her.

Start with one to three friends (or even acquaintances) and decide on a fun social activity like football night, a BBQ, game night, sushi night, a cocktail party, a pool party, or just something fun.

When you step into your masculine, you open the doors for women to fall into their feminine. This is where the deepest levels of attraction can grow.

You are neither inferior nor superior to those around you, and you make others feel at ease around you, which in turn allows women to feel safe and fall into their feminine in your presence. You are not trying to “get” something from them and you are not seeking validation from anyone. You are being authentic and acting from your core.

Masculine polarity is freedom. First achieve freedom from the external, where you need nothing outside of yourself. Then, you’ll come to realize that you are freedom. It is your true self as a man to be free.

You lose dominance when you are stuck in your logical mind and fall into paralysis by switching into analysis mode, asking: what’s the right way? How do you do this? Is it the right time? No, don’t do this, as it leads to inaction and indecisiveness.

Everything you do should be moving toward the life you want (better health, wealth, relationships, personal growth). Anything other than your values should be removed from your life. Eliminate what is unnecessary and do more of what is necessary in your life, and you will see a significant spike in your development as a man.

“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi.

Too often, we pass up on life’s opportunities because we feel like we’re not ready for them. Life is presenting you with opportunities every day, but we prefer to stay in our comfort zone instead of taking action and stepping into the unknown.

Anything you want that’s going to get you closer toward your goals, you must believe you’re enough for it. If you see a girl, then go talk to her. If you want to ask for her phone number, then do it. If you want to kiss a girl then do it. If you want to ask a girl to be your girlfriend, then do it.

These questions and thoughts are lies you tell yourself to avoid the pain of rejection. You are enough and it doesn’t take anything more than a Grounded Man to create attraction with a woman.

Always remember you are of value to women. Not high or low value — no, you are of value. You need to express yourself and share who you are with others because this is what you offer to the world … you. Girls will wonder, “Why isn’t he trying to get me?” They’ll ask, “What’s this guy about?” You should trust that that attraction is building up inside of the girl.

When you love yourself, you take care of yourself, respect yourself, and do not allow second-class behavior from others. Also,.

When you love yourself, you take care of yourself, respect yourself, and do not allow second-class behavior from others. Also, you start believing in yourself, forgive those who have wronged you, and take full responsibility for your life. If you don’t love yourself, you’re never going to find the healthy, incredible, trusting relationship you deserve.

Imagine someone you love being disrespected and how fast you would stand up for them. Why is it we don’t have the same instinct for ourselves?.

Life is what happens when you’re planning for the future,.

Life is what happens when you’re planning for the future, so love yourself in this moment right now.

The ridiculous thing is that while you’re wasting your time wishing you were someone else, there’s someone else wishing he were you.

You are the golden prize. You are enough. You love yourself. You will not accept second-class behavior from anyone or you will simply walk away.

Every time you open your mouth, you are giving a woman the opportunity to experience your value system and a unique set of life experiences. You offer things unique only to you, so let your light shine onto others like it’s a best picture movie.

This goes back to having fun. If you’re having fun, she’s having fun. If you’re feeling insecure about the interaction, she’s feeling insecure and can’t trust you. Without trust, there’s simply no attraction.

When you’re free of outcome, you’re dictating the rhythm of the interaction and others are reacting to you. Be happy doing what you want to say and do. Enjoy talking, hearing yourself, become less attached to the outcome, and attach yourself to your own actions.

Embrace the feeling of not knowing what to do next and of not knowing how this is going to end. Just let go and enjoy the process. There is nothing for you to lose. Be present.

Women will say they want one thing, but do something completely different or irrational. So watch what women act on, not what they say they want.

She wants a man who can protect her, lead her and help her get through life easier, because life is hard.

Such as being unclean, overweight, dressing unfashionably, or not grooming.

This is why it’s very important to befriend her friends and be a trustworthy Grounded Man.

Don’t aim to make every woman like you, instead focus on liking yourself for taking action.

If you’re worried about what other people think about you when you take action in public, then this points out to another, and bigger problem in your life — that you really need to stop caring about what other people think about you. The opinions of others will mean less and less to you the more you go out and meet people. Especially as you start to get more results and you become the rare breed of man who is taking action and moving toward what he wants in life.

When you see a girl you like, go plant your feet right in front of her and talk to her.

When you see a girl you like, go plant your feet right in front of her and talk to her. You will not let any opportunities go right past you because of fear.

You can’t rationalize that you’re working on other areas of your life before you can start interacting with girls and taking action.

Have you ever been out with your friends and you’re firing on all cylinders where everything you say is funny, on point, your rhythm and timing is perfect. Basically, you’re on cloud nine and guess what, you’re sober too.

You have to take responsibility for your state because no one else is going to do it for you. Don’t wait for the DJ to make it better, don’t wait for the alcohol to kick in and don’t wait for your friends to do anything because it’s not coming. You have to get yourself into state on your own. Enter Nero Linguistic Programming which is the relationship between brain, language and the body. You can use this NLP technique: anchor a move like clapping, squeeze your fist, bump your head,.

You have to take responsibility for your state because no one else is going to do it for you.

And, remember, the internal mindset should be: you’re enough, you’re self-amused, freedom from outcome, love yourself, you have massive value; just have a blast and care less about others’ reactions.

“Understand: people judge you by appearances, the image you project through your actions, words, and style. If you do not take control of this process, then people will see and define you the way they want to, often to your detriment. You might think that being consistent with this image will make others respect and trust you, but in fact it is the opposite — over time you seem predictable and weak. Consistency is an illusion anyway — each passing day brings changes within you. You must not be afraid to express these evolutions.  The powerful learn early in life that they have the freedom to mold their image, fitting the needs and moods of the moment. In this way, they keep others off balance and maintain an air of mystery. You must follow this path and find great pleasure in reinventing yourself, as if you were the author writing your own drama” ~ 50 Cent.

You want to interact with a woman you’re interested in, in a man to woman type of way as early as possible to be clear in your intentions. Don’t be afraid to show or tell her that you like her — the girl knows what’s going on. Saying things like, “Do you know what time it is?” or “I’m looking for this place … do you know where it is?” doesn’t help at all. It’s like when someone is lying to you, and you know it. At first, it isn’t a big deal, but because they keep lying, it irritates you even more.

Never approach from behind a girl because this will scare her and when a girl is scared she’s not feeling attraction she’s in a defensive state. It’s either side to side or stand in front of her.

“I actually don’t know what to say right now, but I know I want to talk to you,”.

A lot of guys talk very low and boring, or they’re speaking from their nose which comes across as being weak or timid. You want to project from the chest and stomach and develop a deep, resonating voice. Add a bit of charisma, and this will hold people’s attention longer and create attraction. You can really separate yourself from the masses with a deeper voice, some charisma, and strong, confident eye contact.

Listen, women want you to succeed. They want a confident, fun, Grounded Man to introduce themselves to her. Be the man she so badly wants to meet.

There are too many variables to consider: her upbringing, personality, sense of humor, culture, age, how she’s feeling that day, which go into whether or not she likes you.

You cannot take responsibility for what you can’t control. As long as you have good intentions, you win. There is nothing more of what you could do anyways, so let go of the outcome. You should feel good because you are taking action with your own intentions and living in alignment to what you value — personal growth.

Your opener should get her attention to focus on you.

Women feel a lot safer with you when they know you don’t have an agenda. So, engage her emotions.

If you don’t take a risk and make her invest into the interaction, then you will be overly invested, which may come off as trying too hard.

Whatever she says, it can’t affect you. What I mean, is don’t get butt-hurt or take anything personal because some girls might say mean stuff.

They talk so much that they aren’t even listening to the girl, they’re thinking of what to say next, believing the longer they talk to this girl, the better off they’ll be.

Each line they think, “Oh, that just bought me at least ten to twenty more seconds with her. Now I’ll think of what to say next.”.

80/20 first 2 minutes (you talking the majority of the time) 50/50 after 2 minutes (the conversation balances out) 20/80 after 5 minutes (she’s talking the majority of the time).

When she talks to you, she is investing into the conversation and the more she invests, the more she will comply with you in the future when you ask for her phone number or to move to another venue.

That’s really all there is to it. It is not about you having the perfect thing to say the entire time. It’s really what you do after the opener, that matters.

If you ever feel like you’re doing all the work and not getting much back from a woman, that’s because you are doing all the work, and you’re not allowing her to participate in the conversation.

If you ever feel like you’re doing all the work and not getting much back from a woman, that’s because you are doing all the work, and you’re not allowing her to participate in the conversation. You’re trying to be the masculine and the feminine at the same time, and it just doesn’t work and never will.

A lot of younger women actually aren’t socially good at talking to strangers.

You kick the ball to her and she needs to kick it back.

Since they think they need to impress the girl with some witty lines to win her over.

You can look at her like, “Well, I just did the hard part, what have you got?” kind of look.

Don’t look anywhere else outside of the material she’s giving you.

Stop looking for something you like or have in common.

As more guys approach to talk to her, she’ll wonder what she did wrong for you to leave early, and be happy if she sees you again, and will likely be a completely different person the second time around.

“Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.”.

If she’s from San Diego, “Oooh, really? I hate San Diego… I’m out of here …” turn around and your arm is slightly pushing her away in a fun way.

Have a strong vocal tonality too: talk down, not up. Talk as if you were a king or if you owned the venue you are at.

“Star Wars, because it’s about the hero’s journey of a common man who rises to the call to adventure, overcomes extreme challenges, and transforms into a hero who saves the world from evil. I can relate to this story because I’m in a similar place in my life where the odds are stacked up against me, but I’m working really hard to get to where I want to be in life …”.

Meanwhile, as she’s making you wait, she could meet a lover type of guy who takes her from you. A lover is more exciting, spontaneous, and the “it-just-happened” type of guy.

“Hey, let’s exchange phone numbers real quick.”.

Sometimes girls will test you while exchanging phone numbers with, “What’s my name?” If you don’t know, you screwed up, and some girls can get really pissed off and leave.

Some guys want to text and chat with a girl forever and ever. This does nothing except reduce your value over time.

Download GIF keyboard on your phone.

“Whoa, I just saw your twin at the mall!”.

“So, you fainted from the excitement of getting my texts? Totally understandable. Text me when you wake up : )”.

“Your responses are too fast for me. Slow down, speedy!”.

Stop making a woman a priority in your life when you are just her option.

Just because she may be an attractive woman doesn’t mean you need to chase her around the world! Let her go.

You have to be willing to respect yourself enough to walk away from a woman that isn’t interested in you.

You have to be willing to respect yourself enough to walk away from a woman that isn’t interested in you. She loses respect for you more and more when you put up with her second class behavior to you.

The second you show any signs of weakness, like being too needy, clingy, available, or jealous is the second she starts second guessing you as a potential boyfriend.

When you meet a girl who makes it completely un-motivating to meet other women, then you may have found a girl worth investing more time and energy into.

Enrich your own life yourself. People are so focused on external validation it makes me sick!.

Don’t get why in this day and age there are still people eating fast food, drinking soda, and smoking cigarettes. It’s proven that this stuff will kill you faster, and while you are alive, it makes your life miserable with less physical, emotional, and creative energy which are all things needed to build an amazing life.

Someone spent their entire life learning some great skills or lessons, and they wrote it into a formatted book so you can easily read it for ten dollars or less. It’s a steal. Why aren’t you taking more advantage of this?.

Get a mentor. You can’t do life alone. A mentor is someone who has the result you want in life. Get a mentor for different aspects of your life such as your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth. It will save you money and time, two valuable things in the world.

The grass isn’t greener on the other side, it’s greener where you water it.

I hope you can tell so far in this book that so much of becoming good with women is really about becoming good with yourself.

You can’t beg her to stay when she wants to leave and be somewhere else. Don’t ever change just to impress someone.

There is nothing more attractive than a grounded man who knows what he wants, knows how to get it and is working towards that every day.

“a Grounded Man equals a happy life”.

True happiness comes from within, not from someone else.

Without trust there is no respect, and without respect there is no empathy, and without empathy there is no relationship.

“Listen, I think we need to be more loving to each other. We would really benefit from creating that environment together, because we both deserve this and need it in order to be happy and grow together.”.

The root of failure in relationships is usually a fear of honesty.

“The greatest regret in life is being what others would want you to be, rather than being yourself.”.

We cannot connect with someone who has no flaws and is perfect.

Vulnerability builds self-esteem because you realize the more you share, the more you connect with those who matter. Relationships become easier. Dating becomes easier. Friendships become easier. Life becomes easier.

“You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.”.

When someone gives you their time, they are giving you a portion of their life they will never get back. It’s one of the most precious gifts you can receive: your attention.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest, and the first to move forward is the happiest. Always choose love. Relationships are.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest,.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest, and the first to move forward is the happiest.

You have to understand rejection isn’t always about you. You have no idea what’s going on in a woman’s life, so don’t take things personally.

Don’t get significance from self-pity and attention from others.

To simulate the exploitation of a real reservoir without the costs of real life trial and error, e.g. to test different productions scenarios to find an optimal one before the reservoir is actually put on production.

Generality of all eight corners being handled individually is actually required (.

Some corners to be coinciding, in which case we say that the cell is degenerate. A degenerate cell has fewer actual corners than the eight corners it is defined by.Typically, a degenerate cell will have one or more edge thicknesses equal to zero, e.g. a wedge-shaped cell used to define a pinchout zone.

RESV is a special target. In principle it refers to a fluid rate measured at reservoir conditions. If we e.g. want injection to balance production such that liquid out = liquid in, we cannot do this by setting injected water equal to produced liquid, since the equality ceases to be valid when the fluids are moved to reservoir conditions. But the flag RESV tries to come around this problem.Unfortunately, the calculation of equivalent reservoir fluid volumes are based on average reservoir pressure, not the pressure of the actually produced fluid. So the RESV fluid volumes are only approximately correct. When the fluid flows from the reservoir to the surface in the well, the fluid pressure will decrease as the fluid moves upwards. The pressure drop is proportional to the completion depth, and more or less equal to hydrostatic pressure.Obviously, if the fluid leaves the reservoir at a pressure which is lower than the pressure drop it experiences on the way to the surface, it has too low energy to reach the surface at all.Therefore, if fluids are to be produced without additional means of lifting, it is required that the fluid pressure is above some minimum level when they enter the well. This is the minimum required bottom hole pressure BHP. From Equation (21) we see that the BHP will be lower when the rate is increased. A BHP violation can therefore often be met by reducing rate. Constraints on THP (tubing head pressure) act just as the BHP constraints, but are more realistic. The reason for this is that THP is the pressure measured at the tubing head, i.e. at the surface end of the well. THP is hence an accessible measure, while BHP, measured in the reservoir is only available when such measurements are done, which will be relatively infrequent if at all. To use THP data in the simulation we need to be able to compute THP values from BHP and vice versa. This is done by VFP curves (Vertical Flow Performance), which are curves which do the desired conversions. The VFP relations are complex, involving depths, tubing lengths and fluid saturations, and are beyond the scope of these notes. We will therefore stick to the BHP constraints48.

In reservoir simulators the objective is much the same – to simulate the exploitation of a real reservoir without the costs of real life trial and error, e.g. to test different productions scenarios to find an optimal one before the reservoir is actually put on production.

The description of the reservoir and the boundary conditions for the equations for flow in a porous rock are known only with a great deal of uncertainty.

Primarily, the pore system itself and the flow in this system happens on a detail level that is impossible to describe or model – and if it were possible the resulting problem would be too large to solve on present-day computers anyway. In addition to that, the detail structure of the pore system will obviously be unknown. So the problems we look at are a result of.

This is, because even if there may be uncertainties tied to simulated results, the simulations reveal invaluable information about the reservoir flow, and not the least, can point to areas which need closer investigation or can represent elements of risk to the production scenarios.

Evaluate the quality of the input data.

Transform the input data to a form suitable for simulation.

Identify which parts of the data are most sensitive to uncertainty.

Identify necessary additional data acquisition.

Identify key data which may directly influence choice of operations plans, and uncertainty tied to these.

Perform a suite of reservoir simulations.

Evaluate quality of results from the simulations, uncertainties, areas of robustness.

Utilize available field production data to tune simulations.

Point to potential future problems / solutions, suggest production plans.

Eclipse, by Geoquest / Schlumberger,.

The objective of these lecture notes is thus to enable the user to understand the required input data to a reservoir simulator, convert the input issues to Eclipse format and run simulations with Eclipse, for not-too-complex problems.

Decisions based on the simulations are the goal, not the simulations.

It is the use of the simulator that is important, not the technicalities.

One of the important tasks for a user of a reservoir simulator is to evaluate the quality of simulated results. Are the results “as expected”? – Do the results appear trustworthy?.

It is the author’s opinion and experience that input data will generally be of higher quality, potential simulation errors will be quicker identified, and result evaluation will be more robust if the user has some knowledge of how the input data is handled by the simulator.

It is therefore necessary to subdivide the continuous reservoir into a finite number of discrete elements, and also to define time development in a discrete sense.

The subdivision of the reservoir into finite volume elements or cells is denoted a discretisation of the reservoir, and the set of elements is called the reservoir grid.

The grid is then uniquely defined by the size of each cube, and the number of cubes in each of the major directions, X, Y, Z.

I, J, K are used for indices in X, Y, Z – directions, and the ordering is defined as in “normal reading order”, i.e. I runs from left to right, J runs from top of a page to bottom, and K runs from page to page. In a grid oriented along standard geographical axes, I would increase from west to east, J would increase from north to south, and K downwards.

Is to allow for DX to be dependent on the I-index, and DY to be dependent on the J-index.

We generally try to honour the depth variation of the units in the grid.

Although permeability is a tensor variable, Eclipse only allows for the diagonal elements Kxx, Kyy, and Kzz, called PERMX, PERMY, and PERMZ.

The simplest and most used assumption is constant compressibility.

The initial reservoir state is defined by the pressure and saturations in each grid cell at the start of the simulation.

Assumption that the reservoir fluids are in equilibrium at no-flow conditions.

We then only need supply the depths of the oil-water and gas-oil contacts, and the fluid pressures at a reference depth. The simulator can then calculate the necessary state from fluid weight versus depth gradients.

Describe the well positions, at which depths they are open to the reservoir, and the production or injection rates.

During the field’s life time, wells will be added or closed, well rates will be changed, and operating constraints may be added or removed. All such events are handled by defining a series of milestones, dates at which operating conditions may change.

All data needed by Eclipse is collected in an input data file, which is an ordinary text file.

The keyword data is always terminated by a slash (‘/’).

An Eclipse data file is comprised of eight sections headed by a section header.

RUNSPEC (required) Run specifications. Includes a description of the run, such as grid size, table sizes, number of wells, which phases to include an so forth. GRID (required) Defines the grid dimensions and shape, including petrophysics (porosity, permeability, net-togross). EDIT (optional) User-defined changes to the grid data which are applied after Eclipse has processed them, can be defined in this section. The EDIT section will not be covered in these notes. PROPS (required) Fluid and rock properties (relative permeabilities, PVT tables, ...) REGIONS (optional) User defined report regions, or e.g. regions where different rel.-perm. curves apply can be defined in this section. SOLUTION (required) Equilibration data (description of how the model is to be initialised). SUMMARY (optional) Results output is primarily of two types: 1) Scalar data as a function of time (e.g. average field pressure) 2) Data with one value pr. grid cell (e.g. oil saturation). These are only output at chosen times. This section is used to define output of the first kind, by specifying which data items to write to report files. SCHEDULE (required) Well definitions, description of operating schedule, convergence control, control of output of the second kind described above.

Any line in an Eclipse input file that starts with two dashes (--) is treated as a comment.

(Note that the two dashes must be in column 1 and 2, no leading blanks.).

Note that it is allowed to put a comment after the terminating slash.

It is typically generated by an external program, like e.g. IRAP RMS or FloGrid, not input manually.

We assume that porosity is constant in each layer.

PORO 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.25 0.25 / is equivalent to PORO 8*0.23 0.24 3*0.25 / Note that there must not be any blanks on any side of the asterisk (star).

Eclipse has defined default values for many values, and if we on input set these items to default, Eclipse will use the defined default values instead.

A default value is specified by “1*”, and can be repeated as above, with n* (e.g. to specify that the next three items shall be defaulted use 3*).

(The main reason for using relative addressing is that we then can move an entire project to a new parent folder without having to change all the INCLUDEs in the data files.).

What are they?.

Unified files.

Eclipse is written in FORTRAN,.

Eclipse is written in FORTRAN, and does not use dynamic memory allocation.

Eclipse must know how many wells to allocate memory for, and how much memory is needed for each well.

Firstly the grid is a set of finite volume cells which approximates the reservoir volume including internal characteristics. Secondly the grid is a device for solving the reservoir flow equations in a numerical fashion.

Compromise between actual reservoir shape, numeric accuracy and affordable computing time is a science in itself, which cannot be covered in this context.

DX and DY are of comparable magnitude, and DZ much smaller.

The major reason that XY-cartesian grids are not more or less exclusively used is the existence of faults in the reservoir.

One alternative solution which is growing in popularity, is to use unstructured grids. By allowing for cells with any number of faces, any geometry can be modelled, and at the same time keeping the total number of cells at a manageable level.

A structured grid obeying the coordinate line restriction was originally called a corner point grid by the Eclipse development team. The Eclipse grid format is now a de facto industry standard, and corner point grids are used in a much wider context.

The constraint defined by Eclipse is then that cell corners N1A, N1B,..., N4A, N4B lie on the coordinate line for all layers K.

The constraint defined by Eclipse is then that cell corners N1A, N1B,..., N4A, N4B lie on the coordinate line for all layers K. A way of looking at this is to envisage the coordinate line as a straw, and the corner nodes as beads on this straw. The beads can move up and down on the straw, but are restricted to stay on the straw, which by definition cannot be bended – coordinate lines must be straight lines.

Most or all complex grids for real field simulations are constructed with dedicated software like FloGrid or IRAP RMS.

Then flow in the x-direction will be completely stopped by the slab, such that the effective permeability across the cube in the x-direction is zero, which is also what we would get if we compute the harmonic average.

Another source for inactive cells is the minimum pore volume option. Cells with very small pore volume will contribute insignificantly to flow or production, but exactly because they have a pore volume which is very different from typical values they can have a negative effect on the numerical solution, and total computing time can become (unacceptable) large. For this reason it is possible and advisable to define a minimum pore volume value such that cells with smaller pore volume than this value will be flagged as inactive. For Eclipse, see keywords MINPV or MINPVV.

An inactive cell is a cell that does not contribute to fluid volumes or flow in the reservoir. By default, the simulator will flag any cell with vanishing pore volume as inactive. In addition, the user may define active cells explicitly, by the keyword ACTNUM, where all cells are listed, the active ones as “1”, inactive as “0”.

Important Section.

Permeability is a measure for conductance, and its inverse is a measure for resistance. If we draw the comparison to electrical resistance or conductance, it is evident that we never speak of “resistance in a point”. Resistance or conductance is a property that only has meaning if referred to as “between two points”, i.e. conductance and resistance is a flow property. In the same manner, it is meaningless to speak of “permeability in a point”. If we regard the grid cell as a volume, we could interpret permeability as the flow property across the cell. However, viewing the cell as a volume is solely a convenient visualisation means. By the manner the simulator solves the flow equations the grid is a set of points, and all property values are to be understood as the values in the points. And obviously nothing can vary “in a point”. (By this way of looking at the grid we are less tempted to think that it is possible to model variations within a grid cell volume. If the point of interest is really a point it is evident that no variation can be possible.) The bottom line is that the permeabilities of interest should really be measures for conductivity between different grid points.

Transmissibility.

Also, this course does not specifically address the methodology of reservoir simulation, engineering data preparation and analysis or conduct of simulation studies.

Batch program.

Initialisation refers to defining the initial conditions of the simulation i.e. the pressures and phase saturation at the start date of the simulation. The run can start after the onset of production and injection because ECLIPSE has facilities for continuing a simulation from any reporting step of a previous simulation. This is known as a restart run. The initial conditions can be defined in one of three.

Equilibration is the procedure of defining the initial saturation of each phase and initial hydrostatic pressure gradients everywhere based on contact depths and the pressure at a known depth.

A restart run is a means of initialising a simulation based on the intermediate or final results of a previous simulation.

Interpretative technique of Havlena and Odeh, to gain an understanding of reservoir drive mechanisms under primary recovery conditions.

The equation is derived as a volume balance which equates the cumulative observed production, expressed as an underground withdrawal, to the expansion of the fluids in the reservoir resulting from a finite pressure drop.

Since the initial oil is in equilibrium with a gascap, the oil must be at saturation or bubble point pressure. Reducing the pressure below pi will result in the liberation of solution gas. The total amount of solution gas in the oil is NRsi scf. The amount still dissolved in the N stb of oil at the reduced pressure is NRs scf.Therefore, the gas volume liberated during the pressure drop ∆p, expressed in reservoir barrels at the lower pressure, is N(R − si R s ) B g (rb) (3.2) b) Expansion of the gascap gas The total volume of gascap gas is mNBoi rb, which in scf may be expressed as G mNB = oi B (scf ) gi This amount of gas, at the reduced pressure p, will occupy a reservoir volume mNB B g oi B (rb) gi Therefore, the expansion of the gascap is  B g  mNB − oi 1  B (rb) gi  (3.3) c) Change in the HCPV due to the connate water expansion and pore volume reduction.

Since the initial oil is in equilibrium with a gascap, the oil must be at saturation or bubble point pressure.

All that is known about the total gas production is that, at the lower pressure, Np Rs scf will be dissolved in the Np stb of oil. The remaining produced gas, Np (Rp − Rs) scf is therefore, the total amount of liberated and gascap gas produced during the pressure drop ∆p and will occupy a volume N(Rp − Rs)Bg rb at the lower pressure. The total underground withdrawal term is therefore.

In which the final term (We − Wp)Bw is the net water influx into the reservoir. This has been intuitively added to the right hand side of the balance since any such influx must expel an equivalent amount of production from the reservoir thus increasing the left hand side of the equation by the same amount. In this influx term We = Cumulative water influx from the aquifer into the reservoir, stb. Wp = Cumulative amount of aquifer water produced, stb. and Bw = Water formation volume factor rb/stb. Bw is generally.

Bw is generally close to unity since the solubility of gas in water is rather small and this condition will be assumed throughout this text.

The equation is always evaluated, in the way it was derived, by comparing the current volumes at pressure p to the original volumes at pi . It is not evaluated in a step-wise or differential fashion. Although the equation appears a little intimidating, at first sight, it should be thought of as nothing more than a sophisticated version of the compressibility definition dV = c × V × ∆p Production = Expansion of reservoir fluids.and, under certain circumstances, can in fact be reduced to this simple form. In using the material balance equation, one of the main difficulties lies in the determination of the representative average reservoir pressure at which the pressure dependent parameters in the equation should be evaluated. This follows from the zero dimensional nature of the equation which implies that there should be some point in the reservoir at which a volume averaged pressure can be uniquely determined. In applying the more simple gas material balance, equ.(1.35), such a point could be defined with reasonable accuracy as the centroid point, at which pressures could be evaluated throughout the producing life of the.

Effective, saturation-weighted compressibility of the reservoir.

Since the saturations are conventionally expressed as fractions of the pore volume, dividing by 1 − Swc expresses them as fractions of the hydrocarbon pore volume.

Once the free gas saturation in the reservoir exceeds the critical saturation for flow, then as noted already in Chapter 2, sec.2, the gas will start to be produced in disproportionate quantities compared to the oil and, in the majority of cases, there is little that can be done to avert this situation during the primary production phase. Under very favourable conditions the oil and gas will separate with the latter moving structurally updip in the reservoir. This process of gravity segregation relies upon a high degree of structural relief and a favourable permeability to flow in the updip direction. Under more normal circumstances, the gas is prevented from moving towards the top of the structure by inhomogeneities in the reservoir and capillary trapping forces.

To maintain pressure at 2700 psia the total underground withdrawal at the producing end of a reservoir block must equal the water injection rate at the injection end of the block.

The most remarkable being the Brent field in the North Sea 6 in which at the gas oil contact the oil has a saturation pressure of 5750 psi and a solution gas oil ratio of 2000 scf/stb, while at the oil water contact, some 500 feet deeper, the saturation pressure and solution gas oil ratio are 4000 psi and 1200 scf/stb, respectively. Such extremes are rarely encountered and in the case of the Brent field the anomaly is attributed to gravity segregation of the lighter hydrocarbon components.

The value of N, however, is fairly well defined from information obtained from the producing wells. Under these circumstances the best way to interpret equ.(3.24) is to plot F as a function of (Eo + mEg) for an assumed value of m. If the correct value has been chosen then the resulting plot should be a straight line passing through the origin with slope N, as shown in fig.3.7. If the value of m selected is too small or too large, the plot will deviate above or below the line, respectively.

One advantage of this particular interpretation is that the straight line must pass through the origin which therefore acts as a control point.

Only if there is no water influx.

Description of well testing and well inflow, which have considerable practical application in reservoir engineering. This is considered of greater importance than deriving the basic equation in cartesian coordinates since analytical solutions of the latter are seldom used in practice by field engineers. In numerical reservoir simulation, however, cartesian geometry is more commonly used but even in this case the flow into or out of a well is controlled by equations expressed in radial form such as those presented in the next four chapters.

# A Thousand Splendid Suns (Khaled Hosseini)

Nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice, to see that it is the creators of the harami who are culpable, not the harami, whose only sin is being born.

“You couldn’t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,” he laughed.

“Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man’s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.”.

A man’s heart is a wretched, wretched thing, Mariam.

A man’s heart is a wretched, wretched thing, Mariam. It isn’t like a mother’s womb. It won’t bleed, it won’t stretch to make room for you.

You’re afraid, Nana, she might have said. You’re afraid that I might find the happiness you never had. And you don’t want me to be happy. You don’t want a good life for me. You’re the one with the wretched heart.

‘Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may try you.’.

“That’s one thing I can’t stand,” he said, scowling, “the sound of a woman crying. I’m sorry. I have no patience for it.” “I want to go home,”.

“That’s one thing I can’t stand,” he said, scowling, “the sound of a woman crying. I’m sorry. I have no patience for it.”.

Rasheed himself believed none of this. In his opinion, superstitions were largely a female preoccupation.

And Allah is the East and the West, therefore wherever you turn there is Allah’s purpose.

She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how women like us suffer, she’d said. How quietly we endure all that falls upon us.

Treacherous daughters did not deserve to be mothers, and this was just punishment.

Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may try you.

“You make the night to pass into the day and You make the day to pass into the night, and You bring forth the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living, and You give sustenance to whom You please without measure.”.

“I am not going to cry! Not over you. Not in a thousand years.”.

Like the accordion on which Tariq’s father sometimes played old Pashto songs, time stretched and contracted depending on Tariq’s absence or presence.

I know you’re still young, but I want you to understand and learn this now, he said. Marriage can wait, education cannot. You’re a very, very bright girl. Truly, you are. You can be anything you want, Laila. I know this about you. And I also know that when this war is over, Afghanistan is going to need you as much as its men, maybe even more. Because a society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated, Laila. No chance.

All the hardships a person had to face none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.

Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.

Babi had wiped his eyeglasses clean with the hem of his shirt. To me, it’s nonsense—and very dangerous nonsense at that—all this talk of I’m Tajik and you’re Pashtun and he’s Hazara and she’s Uzbek. We’re all Afghans, and that’s all that should matter. But when one group rules over the others for so long . . . There’s contempt. Rivalry. There is. There always has been.

Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.

“I thought about it the night we got the news,” Mammy said. “I won’t lie to you, I’ve thought about it since too. But, no. Don’t worry, Laila. I want to see my sons’ dream come true. I want to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the day the Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free,.

I want to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the day the Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys see it too. They’ll see it through my eyes.”.

If you’re not careful, people will talk.” Laila opened her mouth to say something. It.

If you’re not careful, people will talk.”.

Smile, and this thick, thick black hair!” Giti had told Laila. No one.

You?” Laila tapped her foot. “Tell your secret to the wind, but don’t blame it for telling the trees.”.

“Tell your secret to the wind, but don’t blame it for telling the trees.”.

Tariq knew this. He knew she could not wipe away the obligations of her life any more than he could his, but it went on, his pleadings and her rebuttals, his proposals and her apologies, his tears and hers. In the end, Laila had to make him leave.

“You’re on a deserted island. You can have five books. Which do you choose? I never thought I’d actually have to.” “We’ll have to start you a new collection, Babi.”.

Like an art lover running out of a burning museum, she would grab whatever she could—a look, a whisper, a moan—to salvage from perishing, to preserve. But time is the most unforgiving of fires, and she couldn’t, in the end, save it all.

“This is why the Holy Koran forbids sharab. Because it always falls on the sober to pay for the sins of the drunk. So it does.”.

“The Chinese say it’s better to be deprived of food for three days than tea for one.”.

Now—Laila could still remember Babi saying of those years of communist rule, It’s a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan, Laila. Since the Mujahideen takeover in April 1992, Afghanistan’s name had been changed to the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court under Rabbani was filled now with hardliner mullahs who did away with the communist-era decrees that empowered women and instead passed rulings based on Shari’a, strict Islamic laws that ordered women to cover, forbade their travel without a male relative, punished adultery with stoning. Even if the actual enforcement of these laws was sporadic at best. But they’d enforce them on us more, Laila had said to Mariam, if they weren’t so busy killing each other. And.

Even the snakebitten man finds sleep, but not the hungry.

One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.

Marveling at how every Afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief.

A woman who will be like a rock in a riverbed, enduring without complaint, her grace not sullied but shaped by the turbulence that washes over her.

Not long ago, women in Afghanistan were professors at universities, they were doctors and lawyers, worked in hospitals, taught at schools and played an important role in society. They were women like my mother, who was university educated and a teacher of Farsi and history, eventually becoming the vice principal of a very large high school for girls. But that was in Kabul, and Afghanistan is not a nation of urbanized middle-class people. There has always been an ideological gap between liberal reformist Kabul and rural Afghanistan.

There was a king named Amanullah in the 1920s who actually banned the wearing of the burqa in public.

On August 2, 1990, yet another of the century’s dictators, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, invaded the neighboring country of Kuwait. His goal was not only conquest of a sovereign state, but also the capture of its riches. The prize was enormous. If successful, Iraq would have become the world’s leading oil power, and it would have dominated both the Arab world and the Persian Gulf, where the bulk of the planet’s oil reserves is concentrated. Its new strength and wealth and control of oil would have forced the rest of the world to pay court to the ambitions of Saddam Hussein. The result would have been a dramatic shift in the international balance of power. In short, mastery itself was once more the prize.

Gasoline was then only an almost useless by-product, which sometimes managed to be sold for as much as two cents a gallon, and, when it could not be sold at all, was run out into rivers at night. But just as the invention of the incandescent light bulb seemed to signal the obsolescence of the oil industry, a new era opened with the development of the internal combustion engine powered by gasoline. The oil industry had a new market, and a new civilization was born.

It is oil that makes possible where we live, how we live, how we commute to work, how we travel—even where we conduct our courtships. It is the lifeblood of suburban communities. Oil (and natural gas) are the essential components in the fertilizer on which world agriculture depends; oil makes it possible to transport food to the totally non-self-sufficient megacities of the world. Oil also provides the plastics and chemicals that are the bricks and mortar of contemporary civilization, a civilization that would collapse if the world’s oil wells suddenly went dry.

George Bissell, who, more than anybody else, was responsible for the creation of the oil industry.

The Healthful balm, from Nature’s secret spring, The bloom of health, and life, to man will bring; As from her depths the magic liquid flows, To calm our sufferings, and assuage our woes.

Silliman banished any doubts about the potential new uses for rock oil. He reported to his clients that it could be brought to various levels of boiling and thus distilled into several fractions, all composed of carbon and hydrogen. One of these fractions was a very high-quality illuminating oil. “Gentlemen,” Silliman wrote to his clients, “it appears to me that there is much ground for encouragement in the belief that your Company have in their possession a raw material from which, by simple and not expensive processes, they may manufacture very valuable products.” And, satisfied with the business relationship as it had finally been resolved, he held himself fully available to take on further projects.

They got hold of every whiskey barrel they could scrounge in the area, and when all the barrels were filled, they built and filled several wooden vats. Unfortunately, one night the flame from a lantern ignited the petroleum gases, causing the entire storage area to explode and go up in fierce flames. Meanwhile, other wells were drilled in the neighborhood, and more rock oil became available. Supply far outran demand, and the price plummeted. With the advent of drilling, there was no shortage of rock oil. The only shortage now was of whiskey barrels, and they soon cost almost twice as much as the oil inside them.7.

The drive for “flush production” often damaged the reservoirs, leading to premature exhaustion of gas pressure, and thus far less recovery than would otherwise have been the case.

Between 1863 and 1865, de-spite much scoffing and public ridicule, wooden pipelines proved that they could carry oil much more efficiently and cheaply. The teamsters, seeing their position challenged, responded with threats, armed attacks, arson, and sabotage. But it was too late. By 1866, pipelines were hooked up to most of the wells in the Oil Regions, feeding into a larger pipeline gathering system that connected with the railroads.

Oil was bought and sold on three bases. “Spot” sales called for immediate delivery and payment. A “regular” sale required the transaction to be completed within ten days. And the sale of “futures” established that a certain quantity would be sold at a certain price within a specified time in the future. The futures prices were the focus for speculation, and oil became “the favorite speculative commodity of the time.” The buyer was bound either to take the oil and pay the contracted price—or to pay or receive the difference between the contracted price and the “regular” price at the time of settlement. Thus, buyers could make a handsome profit—or suffer a devastating loss—without even taking possession of the oil.

The son’s character was already set at a young age—pious, single-minded, persistent, thorough, attentive to detail, with both a gift and a fascination for numbers, especially numbers that involved money. At the age of seven, he launched his first successful venture—selling turkeys. His father sought to teach him and his brothers mercantile skills early. “I trade with the boys,” the father was reported to have boasted, “and skin ’em and I just beat ’em every time I can. I want to make ’em sharp.” Mathematics was the young Rockefeller’s best subject in high school. The school stressed mental arithmetic—the ability to do calculations quickly in one’s head—and he excelled at it.

In 1867, Rockefeller was joined by a young man, Henry Flagler, whose influence in the creation of Standard Oil was almost as great as Rockefeller’s.

“Keep your head above water and bet on the growth of your country.”.

At the end of the 1880s, he committed himself to the creation of a great Baptist university, and, in that cause, he provided the endowment, as well as the organizational focus, for the establishment of the University of Chicago. He continued to be by far its largest donor. Though he paid keen attention to its development, he did not interfere in its academic workings, save to insist that it stay within its budget. He refused to allow any buildings to be named after him so long as he was alive, and visited the university only twice in its first ten years. The initial visit was in 1896, on its fifth anniversary. “I believe in the work,” he told a university convocation. “It is the best investment I ever made in my life.

By 1910, the “spare change” that Rockefeller had given to the university added up to $35 million, compared to $7 million from all other sources. And, altogether, to all his causes, he was to give away some $550 million. He carried over his habits of business.

Stockholders—Rockefeller built his fortune by taking on a youthful, wild, unpredictable, and unreliable industry, and relentlessly transforming it according to his own logic into a highly organized, far-flung business that satisfied the basic hunger for light around the world.20.

Finally, in 1861, a Philadelphia shipper obtained a crew by getting the potential recruits drunk and virtually shanghaiing them aboard the sailing ship.

The prolific Baku fields continued to throw up new petroleum fountains and ever more oil. But there had been one dramatic change in the Russian oil industry. While Ludwig Nobel’s patience and determination did not abate in the face of the never-ending obstacles, physically he was worn out. In 1888 at the age of fifty-seven, the Oil King of Baku died of a heart attack while vacationing on the French Riviera. Some of the European newspapers confused the Nobel brothers and instead reported the death of Alfred. Reading his own premature obituaries, Alfred was distressed to find himself condemned as a munitions maker, the “dynamite king,” a merchant of death who had made a huge fortune by finding new ways to maim and kill. He brooded over these obituaries and their condemnations, and eventually rewrote his will, leaving his money for the establishment of the prizes that would perpetuate his name in a way that would seem to honor the best in human endeavor.6.

Marcus Samuel was always the trader, the idea man, and Samuel Samuel, two years younger, always the loyal adherent and sidekick.

Marcus was the more complicated, and as the years went by, his considerable charm gave way to a remoteness that almost seemed to be a mask. Short and stout, with heavy eyebrows, he was totally unprepossessing in appearance. But he was capable of bold vision, and he was adventurous, ingenious, quick to act, and single-minded when he chose to be. He talked in a very soft voice, sometimes hardly audible, making people strain to hear him and perhaps making himself all the more persuasive. He also instilled trust in people, so much so that for two decades, he depended for his credit not on bankers but on those Scottish merchants in the Far East. Marcus had more on his agenda than simply accumulating wealth for its own sake. He had a craving for position. As an outsider, as a Jew born in the East End of London, he would put his considerable energies into seeking and winning acceptance for the name Samuel at the highest levels of British society.

The construction workers were forced to brave armed attacks from railway men, as well as steam, hot water, and hot coals poured over them from locomotives. Such may have been the “gloved hand” of Standard Oil at work. Nevertheless, the pipeline got built.

Lucas and Higgins made a deal, and the captain commenced drilling in 1899. His first efforts failed. More professional geologists ridiculed the concept. They told him that he was wasting his time and money. There was no chance that a salt dome could mean oil. Captain Lucas could not convince them otherwise. He was discouraged by the professionals’ rejection of what he called his “visions,” and his confidence was shaken. He ran out of money, and he needed new funds if he was to continue. He won a hearing from Standard Oil, but was turned away empty-handed.

Lucas 1 on Spindletop, as the well became known, was flowing not at fifty barrels per day, but at as much as seventy-five thousand barrels per day. The roar could be heard clearly in Beaumont; some people thought it was the end of the world. It was something never seen before anywhere—except in the “oil fountains” of Baku. The.

In 1892, in response to a court decision in Ohio, the trust was dissolved and the shares were transferred to twenty companies. But control remained with the same owners. The companies were grouped together as the “Standard Oil Interests.” Under this new arrangement, the Executive Committee at 26 Broadway gave way to an informal meeting of presidents of the various constituent firms that constituted the Standard Oil Interests. Letters were no longer addressed to the Executive Committee, but rather simply to the “gentlemen upstairs.”.

“First, he avoids all worry. Second, he takes plenty of exercise in the open air. Third, he gets up from the table a little hungry.”.

To a commission investigating Standard Oil, “We are not in business for our health, but are out for the dollars.”.

Was at Twain’s urging that Rogers took over the financing of the education of the blind and deaf Helen Keller, enabling her to go to Radcliffe.

The company transported more than four-fifths of all oil produced in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. It refined more than three-fourths of all United States crude oil; it owned more than half of all tank cars; it marketed more than four-fifths of all domestic kerosene and was responsible for more than four-fifths of all kerosene exported; it sold to the railroads more than nine-tenths of all their lubricating oils. It also sold a vast array of by-products—including 300 million candles of seven hundred different types. It even deployed its own navy—seventy-eight steamers and nineteen sailing vessels. How was all this to be dismembered?.

Royal Dutch desperately tried to find new production. No fewer than 110 times did it drill for oil in Sumatra, and no fewer than 110 times did it fail to find new oil.

“I am at present in a generous mood. I have made you this offer, but if you leave this room without accepting it, the offer is off.”.

Samuel treated himself to a 650-ton yacht to assuage his hurt and took himself to sea.

John Arbuthnot Fisher, who would be memorialized by Marcus Samuel as “the God-father of oil,” became First Sea Lord in 1904. For the next six years,.

‘He’s a good teapot though he may be a bad pourer’!”.

“mastery itself was the prize of the venture.”.

“we should be able to raise the whole power and efficiency of the Navy to a definitely higher level; better ships, better crews, higher economies, more intense forms of war power”—in.

At last, Marcus Samuel’s dream of an oil-fueled British Navy looked to become a reality. But one question remained: who would reap the profits? The likely choices were only two: the powerful and entrenched Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and the much smaller and still-struggling Anglo-Persian Oil Company.10.

Fidgety and aggravated as Churchill spoke.15 “This afternoon we have to deal, not with the policy of building oil-driven ships or of using oil as an ancillary fuel in coal-driven ships,”.

“This afternoon we have to deal, not with the policy of building oil-driven ships or of using oil as an ancillary fuel in coal-driven ships,” Churchill began, “but with the consequence of that policy.”.

“Look out upon the wide expanse of the oil regions of the world. Two gigantic corporations—one in either hemisphere—stand out predominantly. In the New World there is the Standard Oil. … In the Old World the great combination of the Shell and the Royal Dutch, with all their subsidiary and ancillary branches, has practically covered the whole ground, even reached out into the New World.”.

“a long steady squeeze by the oil trusts all over the world.”.

“He had better hear the case for the prosecution,” Churchill acidly said after the third interruption, “before he offers an argument for the defense.”.

Samuel resumed his seat but not his composure.

“For many years,” Churchill went on, “it has been the policy of the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Indian Government to preserve the independent British oil interests of the Persian oil-field, to help that field to develop as well as we could and, above all, to prevent it being swallowed up by the Shell or by any foreign or cosmopolitan companies.”.

“over the whole of these enormous regions we obtain the power to regulate developments according to naval and national interest.” Declaring that “all the criticisms” of such a plan “so far, have flowed from one fountain,” Churchill then launched an attack on that fountain—Royal Dutch/Shell and Marcus Samuel—though adding, “I do not wish to make any attack upon the Shell or the Royal Dutch Company.” “Not the least!” Samuel Samuel called out from the back bench. Churchill’s oratory was full of sarcasm. Were the bill to fail, he said, Anglo-Persian would become part of Shell. “We have no quarrel with the ‘Shell.’ We have always found them courteous, considerate, ready to oblige, anxious to serve the Admiralty, and to promote the interests of the British Navy and the British Empire—at a price. The only difficulty has been price.” With the leverage of Persian oil “at our disposal, we do not think we shall be treated with less courtesy, or less consideration, or shall we find these gentlemen less obliging, less public spirited, or less patriotic than before. On the contrary, if that slight difference of opinion which has hitherto existed about prices—I am obliged to return to that vicious and sordid matter of prices—were removed, our relations would be better; they would become … the sweeter, because no longer leavened with the sense of injustice.”.

Churchill’s proposal for government ownership of a private company was indeed unprecedented,.

“How did you manage to carry the House with you so successfully?” “It was,” Churchill replied, the “attack on monopolies and trusts that did it.”16.

Here, in the matter of Deterding, Churchill was following Admiral Fisher’s lead. Fisher wrote to Churchill that Deterding, “is Napoleon and Cromwell rolled into one. He is the greatest man I ever met … Napoleonic in his audacity: Cromwellian in his thoroughness! … Placate him, don’t threaten him! Make a contract with him for his fleet of 64 oil tankers in case of war. Don’t abuse the Shell Company. … [Deterding] has a son at Rugby or Eton and has bought a big property in Norfolk and [is] building a castle! Bind him to the land of his adoption!”.

The critics had a point. Why the troubles of Scotch whisky when one produced a fine wine?.

Many reasons were proffered—from blunder, arrogance, and stupidity to the accumulated tensions of international rivalries and industrial society. The reasons also encompassed the secular religion of nationalism; the sclerosis of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Turkish empires; the collapse of the traditional balance of power; and the ambitions.

The reliance on horses greatly complicated the problems of supply, for each horse required ten times as much food as each man.

By.

Yet what was needed was not necessarily wanted.

Taken up and championed by Winston Churchill.

And, in the face of the Army’s resistance, Churchill doled out Navy funds for the continuing research needed to develop the new vehicle.

Reflecting the Navy’s temporary sponsorship, the new machine was known as the “land cruiser” or the “landship.” Churchill called it the “caterpillar.” To maintain secrecy, it needed a code name while it was being tested and transported, and various names—among others, the “cistern” and the “reservoir”—were considered. But finally it became known by another of its code names—the “tank.”.

Samuel and his colleagues conceived a daring plan, which was swiftly put into effect. In the middle of the night at the end of January 1915, the plant in Rotterdam was disassembled, part by part, each piece numbered and camouflaged, and then carried to the docks and loaded onto a Dutch freighter, which slipped out into the darkness to rendezvous at sea with British destroyers. A cover story was leaked to German agents that such an evacuation was to take place—but that it would occur a day later than the actual event. That following night, whether by coincidence or not, a similar Dutch freighter was torpedoed by the Germans at the mouth of Rotterdam’s harbor. The parts of the toluol plant, meanwhile, were transported to Britain, and were re-erected in Somerset within weeks. That plant, along with a second one that Shell subsequently built, provided 80 percent of the British military’s TNT. It was for this achievement, in large part, that Samuel was awarded a peerage after the war.

“You may have men, munitions, and money, but if you do not have oil, which is today the greatest motive power that you use, all your other advantages would be of comparatively little value.”.

Britain wanted to assert its influence over what was loosely known as Mesopotamia, the provinces of the now defunct Turkish Ottoman Empire that would later be known as Iraq.

“The hand you dare not bite, kiss it.”.

The issue became more urgent in 1917 when British forces captured Baghdad.

“The world,” he would soon write to the president of Standard Oil, was “suffering from over-production, over-refining, over-transporting, and—last but not least—over-retailing.”.

The fear of shortage was such that one Senator called on the U.S. Navy to reconvert from oil back to coal.

In Britain, where similar shortfalls were anticipated, Anglo-Persian was doing research on extracting liquid fuels from coal, and the British government had given over two acres in Dorset to the cultivation of Jerusalem artichokes in the hope that this plant could produce alcohol in commercial quantities to be used as automobile fuel.

At Cornell University, Teagle seemed to be manager or organizer of almost every student activity. He wrote his undergraduate thesis on the desulfurization of crude oil and scored an unheard-of perfect one hundred in industrial chemistry. Like Gulbenkian, he was encouraged by his professor to study for an advanced degree, and his father responded as sharply as Gulbenkian’s had—in Teagle’s case, with a terse telegram, “Come home at once.”.

“He’d trade and trade and trade. If it was company money, he’d think he was paying too much for a five cent cigar and try to get it for four.”.

It was certainly a great victory for Gulbenkian—the culmination of thirty-seven years of concentration, and a testament to his perseverance and tenacity.

As for kerosene, its production and consumption were negligible by comparison. The “new light” had given way to the “new fuel.”2.

“My friends, it is the juice of the fountain of eternal youth that you are selling. It is health. It is comfort. It is success.

They were searching for a solution to the dilemmas of overproduction and over-capacity in their troubled industry.

At the juncture of these various interests stood Sir John Cadman, the successor to Charles Greenway as chairman of Anglo-Persian. By 1928, Cadman was arriving at the peak of his influence, operating on the same plane as Deterding and Teagle, but also with unparalleled credibility in the eyes of the British government. Growing up in a family of mining engineers, Cadman had begun his own career as a coal mine manager. (He won awards for saving miners during underground disasters.) In time, he became professor of mining at Birmingham University, where he had shocked the academic establishment by introducing a new course in “petroleum engineering,” so novel that an academic opponent denounced it as “flagrantly advertised” and “a blind alley” with “a freak title.” By the outbreak of World War I, Cadman was one of the outstanding experts on oil technology. During the war, as head of the Petroleum Executive, he demonstrated considerable skills both at politics and in managing people. In 1921, he became technical adviser to Anglo-Persian; six years later, the government’s candidate, he became its chairman.

Governments imposed import quotas, set prices, and placed restrictions on foreign exchange.

Governments imposed import quotas, set prices, and placed restrictions on foreign exchange. They forced companies to blend alcohol made from surplus crops into motor fuel, and to use other petroleum substitutes. They levied a multitude of new taxes and intervened to control the direction of the export and import trade in oil to match bilateral trade agreements and larger political links. They blocked profit remittances, forcing investment in domestic facilities that lacked economic justification, and insisted that companies maintain extra inventories.

“We are now confronted with nationalistic policies in almost all foreign countries, as well as decidedly socialistic tendencies in many,”.

Operations in the oil business in Europe, he said, “are 90 percent political and 10 percent oil.” The same seemed to be true in the rest of the world.

The company, to be sure, was convinced that there was no oil to be found in Arabia.

And since the population there was mainly Shia Moslems—whereas the Saudis were Sunni, and not merely Sunni but of the strict Wahabi sect—he paid special attention to the administration and schools of al-Hasa, regularizing the Shias’ status and preventing their harassment.

To be sure, his early practical experience as a mining engineer had taught him that theoretical advice, however expert or august, could be quite wrong.

“we shall be guilty of an unpardonable crime against our race.”.

The fishing fleet, which was one of the main sources of Japan’s food, was ordered to give up oil and instead to depend exclusively upon wind power!.

At a fundamental level, each side had underestimated the other. Just as the Japanese did not think the Americans were technically capable of cracking their most secret codes, so the Americans could not conceive that the Japanese would be able to mount so technically complex an operation.

All of the oil world is divided into three. The “upstream” comprises exploration and production. The “midstream” are the tankers and pipelines that carry crude oil to refineries. The “downstream” includes refining, marketing, and distribution, right down to the corner gasoline station or convenience store. A company that includes together significant upstream and downstream activities is said to be “integrated.”.

By 1940, synthetic fuel output had increased drastically—72,000 barrels per day, accounting for 46 percent of total oil supply.

“The bravest men can do nothing without guns, the guns nothing without plenty of ammunition, and neither guns nor ammunition are of much use in mobile warfare unless there are vehicles with sufficient petrol to haul them around.”.

“The synthetic fuel industry in Japan, in terms of its absorption of materials and manpower and its meager product, was more of a liability than an asset during the war.”.

But the Americans had put together a devastating package—amphibious warfare, carrier air power, and industrial might. The Japanese could not match this enormous expenditure of resources.

It was out of desperation in this battle that the Japanese explicitly introduced a new weapon—the suicide pilots called kamikazes. The word meant “divine wind,” after a typhoon in the thirteenth century that had shattered the great invasion fleet of Kublai Khan before it could land in Japan. These suicide pilots, who were ordered to crash their planes (including specially designed manned rocket bombs) onto the decks of the American ships, were meant to be the ultimate embodiment of the Japanese spirit, inspiring all their compatriots to total sacrifice.

If he crashed his plane, not only would his commitment and willingness to die unnerve an enemy who could not comprehend the mentality of such an act, but—since he was not going to return—his fuel requirement was cut in half.8 The End of the Imperial.

Stalin had promised Roosevelt and Churchill to bring the Soviet Union into the war against Japan some ninety days after the end of the war in Europe.

Russia had suffered at the hands of the Japanese in 1905.

The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and sent its troops pouring into Manchuria, a week earlier than had been planned, in order to ensure that the war did not end before it could get in. On August 9, the second atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki. Yet even as late as the Nagasaki explosion, the Army Chief of Staff insisted on reminding senior officials that Japanese soldiers and sailors were not permitted to surrender under any circumstances; suicide was the only acceptable way out.

One of the biggest technical disappointments of the war was PLUTO—the acronym for “Pipeline Under the Ocean.” This underwater pipeline system was designed to link the British side of the English Channel to the French.

Everlasting reputation. That was only the beginning. DeGolyer was more responsible than any other single person for the introduction of geophysics into oil exploration. He pioneered the development of the seismograph, one of the most important innovations in the.

DeGolyer was more responsible than any other single person for the introduction of geophysics into oil exploration.

He was a founder of what became Texas Instruments.

When he came back to Washington in early 1944, DeGolyer reported that the proven and probable reserves of the region—Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar—amounted to about 25 billion barrels. Of that, Saudi Arabia accounted for about 20 percent—perhaps 5 billion barrels. He was a conservative man, and he applied the same standards for “proven” and “probable” reserves on behalf of the United States government as he would have in appraising the reserves for a bank. In fact, he suspected that the reserves would be much, much larger. And, indeed, estimates that sounded like lunacy—up to 300 billion barrels for the region and 100 billion barrels for Saudi Arabia alone—resulted from his trip. One of the members of his mission told officials in the State Department, “The oil in this region is the greatest single prize in all history.”.

“The immense oil deposits in Saudi Arabia alone make that country more important to American diplomacy than almost any other smaller nation.”.

Its imperial role had become an insupportable burden. During those few bleak, freezing, and pivotal weeks of February 1947, the Labour government of Clement Attlee referred its intractable Palestine problem to the United Nations and announced that it would grant independence to India. And on February 21 it told the United States that it could no longer afford to prop up the Greek economy. It asked that the United States take over that responsibility and, by implication, broader responsibilities throughout the Near and Middle East.

Another obstacle was the stubbornness of the countries the pipeline had to cross, particularly Syria, all of which were demanding what seemed to be exorbitant transit fees. It was also the time when the partition of Palestine and the establishment of the state of Israel were aggravating American relations with the Arab countries. But the emergence of a Jewish state, along with the American recognition that followed, threatened more than transit rights for the pipeline.

They both sell their grain at the same price. But the costs of the one with the more fertile fields are much less than those of the one with the less fertile fields.

Generation to Adam Smith. Ricardo developed the concept that was to provide the framework for the battle between nation-states and oil companies. It was the notion of “rents” as something different from normal profits. His case study involved grain, but it could also apply to oil. Let there be two landlords, said Ricardo, one with fields much more fertile than the other. They both sell their grain at the same price. But the costs of the one with the more fertile fields are much less than those of the one with the less fertile fields.

The Organization for European Economic Cooperation (subsequently the OECD) created a Petroleum Emergency Group, which actually made the allocations, based on a formula that reflected pre-Suez oil use, stock levels, and local energy supplies.

“He was the last prime minister to believe Britain was a great power and the first to confront a crisis which proved she was not.”.

The Suez crisis gave the international oil industry considerable food for thought. Despite the return to operation of the canal, the oil companies were no longer confident that they could rely on it. A great deal of discussion followed among companies and governments about building more pipelines.

He offered a special prayer for the British people—that they might discover “a lake of oil” under the North Sea. That was exactly what they were just beginning to do in 1970, though they would not be able to benefit from it in time to prevent Edward Heath from being toppled by another energy crisis.

The leading petroleum engineers of the day, was just finishing a secret study for the Saudi Arabian government of its reserves.

Proven world oil reserves in the noncommunist world increased from 62 billion barrels in 1948 to 534 billion barrels in 1972, almost a ninefold rise.

American reserves had grown from 21 billion barrels in 1948 to 38 billion barrels by 1972. But their statistical significance had shrunk, from 34 percent of total world reserves to a mere 7 percent.

What these enormous numbers meant was that, as fast as the world was using oil, it was even more quickly adding new reserves.

In 1950, the industry estimated that, with current proven reserves at current rates of production, the world had enough oil to last nineteen years.

By 1972, after all the years of rapid growth, of the intoxicating increase in consumption and the pell-mell pace of production, the estimated reserve life was thirty-five years.

The postwar petroleum order rested on two foundations. One was composed of the great oil deals of the 1940s, which had established the basic relationships among companies operating in the Middle East. These arrangements mobilized the resources required for the rapid development of the petroleum reserves, tied production to the refining and marketing systems required by the scale of reserves, and developed and secured the much larger demand that was required. The second foundation was composed of the concessional and contractual relationships between the companies and the governments of the oil-producing countries, at the heart of which was the hard-won fifty-fifty profit-sharing arrangement. On those two bases, it was hoped, relative stability would be built.

In the changing dynamics of the petroleum industry. It marked the first real steps toward creating a common front against the oil companies. As for Wanda Jablonski, she was as usual near the center of the action; she had just been the matchmaker for an alliance that would develop into the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries—OPEC.19.

At one point, Russian oil could be picked up in Black Sea ports at about half the posted price of Middle Eastern oil.

The meeting was contentious. The company had a new chairman, the no-nonsense Monroe Rathbone, known as “Jack.” Rathbone’s life was practically a textbook of the American oil industry.

By September 10, representatives of the major exporting countries—Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran—had arrived in Baghdad. Qatar attended as an observer.

Yet, by September 14, the group had completed its work. A new entity had been established with which to confront the international oil companies. It was called the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and it made its intention clear: to defend the price of oil—more precisely, to restore it to its precut level. From.

They also called for a system of “regulation of production,”.

And they committed themselves to solidarity in case the companies sought to impose “sanctions” on one of them.

And they would not dare cut the posted price again.

But by the middle 1950s, there was growing suspicion among geologists that the country might produce oil. To encourage exploration and development, the Libyan Petroleum Law of 1955 provided for a host of much smaller concessions, instead of the very large concession areas characteristic of the Persian Gulf countries. “I did not want Libya to begin as Iraq or as Saudi Arabia or as Kuwait,” explained the Libyan petroleum minister who oversaw the law. “I didn’t want my country to be in the hands of one oil company.” Libya would give many of the concessions to independent companies, which did not have oil production and concessions to protect in other countries in the Eastern Hemisphere, and thus would have no reason to hold back from exploring and producing as much, and as rapidly, as they could in Libya. The law offered another incentive. The government’s take would be pegged to the actual market price for its oil, which was lower than the increasingly fictional posted price. This meant that Libyan oil would be more profitable than oil from other countries, which was an excellent reason for any company to maximize its Libyan output.

Between 1960 and 1969, the market price for oil fell by 36 cents a barrel, a drop of 22 percent.

The global battle of production intensified the long-standing rivalry between the two key oil countries of the Middle East—Iran and Saudi Arabia. The swell of output around the world put the major companies in a political quandary.

There were many points of conflict between the two nations: one was Arab and one was not; one was Sunni Moslem and the other Shia Moslem. Each wanted to be the leader, both in the region and among oil producers, and each had unfulfilled territorial ambitions. Their competition over levels of oil production underscored the fundamental jealousy and suspicion between the two countries. For output translated into wealth; and wealth in turn meant power, influence, and respect.

If it can be said, in the abstract, that the sun energized the planet, it was oil that now powered its human population, both in its familiar forms as fuel and in the proliferation of new petrochemical products.

If it can be said, in the abstract, that the sun energized the planet, it was oil that now powered its human population, both in its familiar forms as fuel and in the proliferation of new petrochemical products. Oil emerged triumphant, the undisputed King, a monarch garbed in a dazzling array of plastics. He was generous to his loyal subjects, sharing his wealth to, and even beyond, the point of waste. His reign was a time of confidence, of growth, of expansion, of astonishing economic performance. His largesse transformed his kingdom, ushering in a new drive-in civilization. It was the Age of Hydrocarbon Man.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the price of oil fell until it became very cheap, which also contributed mightily to the swelling of consumption. Many governments encouraged its use to power economic growth and industrial modernization, as well as to meet social and environmental objectives. There was one final reason that the market for oil grew so rapidly. Each oil-exporting country wanted higher volumes of its oil sold in order to gain higher revenues. Using various mixtures of incentives and threats, many of these countries put continuing pressure on their concessionaires to produce more, and that, in turn, gave the companies powerful impetus to push oil aggressively into whatever new markets they could find.

1955, coal provided 75 percent of total energy use in Western Europe, and petroleum just 23 percent. By 1972, coal’s share had shrunk to 22 percent, while oil’s had risen to 60 percent—almost a complete flip-flop.

In the spring of 1967, the ARCO-Humble venture began drilling what would certainly be the last wildcat if it failed. The well was dubbed Prudhoe Bay State Number 1. On December 26, 1967, a loud, vibrating sound drew a crowd of about forty men to the well. They were wrapped in heavy clothes—it was thirty degrees below zero—and they had to struggle to hold their places in the thirty-knot wind. The noise grew louder and louder—the roar of natural gas. To one geologist it sounded like four jumbo jets flying directly overhead. A natural gas flare from a pipe shot defiantly thirty feet straight up in the strong wind. They had struck oil. In mid-1968, a “step-out well,” drilled seven miles from the discovery well, confirmed that this was a great structure, a world-class oil field. A true elephant.

In a bizarre twist, the embargo also extended to United States military forces in the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Sixth Fleet, among whose de facto responsibilities was the protection of some of those states that were imposing the embargo.

With the timely publication of Small is Beautiful in 1973, he had found, after decades of anonymity, his metier as spokesman for those who challenged the tenets of unbridled growth and the “bigger is better” philosophy that had dominated the 1950s and 1960s.

But the Royal Dutch/Shell Group was 60 percent owned by the Dutch and only 40 percent by the British. So,.

The Iranians had a rationale for their price. It was based not on supply and demand but on what the Shah called a “new concept,” the cost of alternative energy sources—liquids and gas made from coal and shale oil.

“The alternative source existed, in the volume required, only in economic theory, not in reality.”.

Oil prices were at the heart of world commerce, and those who seemed to control oil prices were regarded as the new masters of the global economy.

“a combination of producers to regulate the prices and the output of a commodity.” OPEC was certainly trying to set price, but not output—not.

“a combination of producers to regulate the prices and the output of a commodity.” OPEC was certainly trying to set price, but not output—not yet.

In 1975, for instance, about 45 percent of what the Western European consumer paid for oil products went to his government, while about 35 percent was accounted for by the OPEC price. The other 20 percent went for shipping, refining, dealer’s margins, and so forth. The argument had less validity for the United States, where the tax component was only 18 percent, while the share going to the OPEC exporter was more on the order of 50 percent. In Japan, the government took 28 percent, with 45 percent going to OPEC. Whatever the split, the consumer governments responded to the OPEC claim by saying that what they did within their borders and how they taxed their citizens was their own business, and that the macro-economic consequences of their sales taxes were strikingly different from that of the “OPEC tax.”.

Though OPEC was commonly said to be split between “radicals” and “moderates,” this same question was also the focus of a running battle between the two largest producers in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran.

For the Shah, the December 1973 price increase had been his great victory, and very much a personal one. From then on, he saw his moment and opportunity—the prospect of seemingly endless revenues, provided as if by divine intervention, to fulfill his ambitions to create what he called Iran’s Great Civilization, and, by the way, solve Iran’s mounting domestic economic problems. “One of the only things my husband likes in life,” said the Empress in the mid-1970s, “is flying, driving, driving boats—speed!” The Shah applied his passion for speed to his entire country in an attempt to hurtle Iran into the twenty-first century. In so doing, he would ignore the agitation and disorientation that such rapidity caused, as well as the resentment and unhappiness among the many who did not share his obsession with modernity. Iran, the Shah proclaimed, would become the world’s fifth largest industrial power; it would be a new West Germany, a second Japan. “Iran will be one of the serious countries in the world,” he boasted. “Everything you can dream of can be achieved here.”.

The Saudis feared that higher prices, and the expectation thereof, could set off a move away from oil to conservation and to other fuel sources that would change and contract that long-term market for oil and thus diminish the value of their reserves.

Megalomaniac,.

Further oil price hikes would only provide Iran with still more money and power, enabling it to buy even more weapons, thus shifting the strategic balance and encouraging the Shah to claim hegemony over the Gulf.

When the other exporters were looking for justification to raise prices, the Saudis in opposition would push up their production to try to weaken the market. But in so doing, they made a disconcerting discovery. Their sustainable production capacity was not as high as had been assumed.2.

Yamani had already been oil minister for eleven years and had developed considerable experience and skill, and superb negotiating talents. His voice was soft, forcing adversaries to strain and to be silent to hear what he said. He almost never lost his temper; the angrier he got, the more quiet he became. Flamboyant rhetoric was not his style. He went logically from point to point, dwelling on each long enough to draw out the essence, the connections, the imperatives, and the consequences. It was all so simple and persuasive and so overwhelmingly obvious and irrefutable that only a maniac or a simpleton could disagree.

Yamani carefully crafted his mystique; he was the master of patience and of the unblinking stare.

“In my public life, in my personal life, in everything I do I think long term,”.

“Once you start thinking short term, you are in trouble because short-term thinking is only a tactic for immediate benefit.”.

Criticized higher prices, the Shah quickly shot back, “No one can dictate to us. No one can wave a finger at us, because we will wave a finger back.”.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Nixon and Kissinger had established a “blank check” policy, giving the Shah a free hand to buy as many American weapons systems as he wanted, even the most technologically advanced, so long as they were not nuclear. The policy was part of the “twin pillars strategy,” established for regional security in the wake of the British withdrawal from the Gulf.

The Defense Department was alarmed by this blank check; in its view, Iran needed a strong conventional army, but not ultramodern weapons systems that it would have trouble mastering and that might fall into the hands of the Russians. Defense Secretary James Schlesinger personally cautioned the Shah that Iran lacked the technical resources to assimilate so many new and complex weapons systems. “He fell in love with the F-15,” said Schlesinger. While the Shah normally brushed aside such warnings, in the case of the F-15, he heeded the advice and did not purchase that particular aircraft.

As the Shah saw it, he was being asked by Carter to make a trade: to join Saudi Arabia in moderation on oil prices in exchange for the continued flow of arms from the United States and relief from the pressure on human rights. Carter stressed “the punishing impact of increased oil prices on the industrial economies.” Contradicting much of what he had said since the end of 1973, the Shah agreed with Carter, and he promised to urge the other OPEC countries to “give Western nations a break.”.

France also developed the most aggressive government policy on energy conservation. Inspectors would swoop down on banks, department stores, and offices and do “le check up”—take the inside temperature with special thermometers. If the temperature exceeded the officially approved twenty-degree-centigrade level, fines would be levied on the building management. But perhaps the most striking aspect of France’s overall energy conservation program, and an altogether French initiative, was the ban on any advertising that “encouraged” energy consumption.

But perhaps the most striking aspect of France’s overall energy conservation program, and an altogether French initiative, was the ban on any advertising that “encouraged” energy consumption. A manufacturer could advertise that his portable electric heater was more efficient than comparable heaters, but he could not say that electric heating was the best form of heating, because that encouraged energy use.

Exxon’s tiger was tamed in France; no longer in the tank, he was judiciously advising motorists to check their tires and tune their engines to save gasoline.

One of the two French national oil companies, Total, searched desperately for some way to keep its name in front of the public. At last, it had a brilliant idea. It started putting up billboards, picturing a beautiful piece of green French countryside, with a simple legend announcing “This is France” and signed “Total.” The ad was banned. A stunned Total asked why. “It is easy,” said Jean Syrota, the director of the Energy Conservation Agency. “Consumers look at this ad and say, ‘Oil companies are wasting a great deal of money on such ads, therefore the companies must be rich, therefore there must not be any energy problem, therefore it is all right to waste energy.’”1.

“I understand now what Hell is. Hell is endless and eternal sessions of the natural gas conference.”.

The number-one commandment was to avoid, at all costs, nationalism in the Third World. In any event, exploration in most of the OPEC countries was fore-closed because of nationalization, and there was a rather strong presupposition that, if a company had success in other developing countries, the fruits would be seized before they could be ingested, leaving only small pieces and bits for the company. So the companies redirected their exploration spending, to the degree possible, to the industrial countries of the Western world: to the United States, despite a growing pessimism about its oil potential, to Canada, and to the British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.

“Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it.”.

It had become evident in the mid-1970s that Iran simply could not absorb the vast increase in oil revenues that was flooding into the country. The petrodollars, megalomaniacally misspent on extravagant modernization programs or lost to waste and corruption, were generating economic chaos and social and political tension throughout the nation. The rural populace was pouring from the villages into the already-overcrowded towns and cities; agricultural output was declining, while food imports were going up. Inflation had seized control of the country, breeding all the inevitable discontents. A middle manager or a civil servant in Tehran spent up to 70 percent of his salary on rent. Iran’s infrastructure could not cope with the pressure suddenly thrust upon it; the backward railway system was overwhelmed; Tehran’s streets were jammed with traffic. The national electricity grid could not meet demand, and it broke down. Parts of Tehran and other cities were regularly blacked out, sometimes for four or five hours a day, a disaster for industrial production and domestic life and a further source of anger and discontent.

“We are melting away daily like snow in water.”.

American policy had been based on the premise that Iran was a reliable ally and would be the Big Pillar in the region.

Neither BP nor Shell were members of Aramco, so they had no direct access to the increased Saudi production, which went to the four American Aramco companies.

He began by invoking as his text The World Crisis, Winston Churchill’s history of World War I. It was in the pages of that book that Churchill wrote of his efforts to convert the British Navy from coal to oil, despite the risk that would come from depending upon oil from Iran. Now, six decades later, eerily and uncannily, that risk had become reality.

Young graduates in geology were wined and dined and courted, and paid fifty thousand dollars a year for their first job out of school.

Geologists with twenty years of experience were quitting the majors to put together deals and keep a piece for themselves, dreaming that they might become a new H. L. Hunt or the next J. Paul Getty.

Had interests on both sides of the divide. It was the world’s largest importer and consumer of oil, and yet it was also the world’s second-largest producer of oil, and a good part of its financial system had cast its fate with high oil prices. If push came to shove, on which side would the United States line up?.

By the middle 1980s, OPEC was faced with a critical choice. It could cut price; but where would a falling price stop? Or it could continue to prop up the price. But if it did that, it would be holding up an umbrella under which non-OPEC oil, competing energy sources, and conservation would all flourish, guaranteeing itself a shrinking market share.

First, this would undercut the large and expensive commitment they had made to alternative energy sources, leading, they were sure, back to higher oil dependence and eventually to renewed vulnerability, and setting the stage for another crisis. Second,.

There did not seem to be any long-term problem of supply; after all, proven world oil reserves had been mightily increased—from 670 billion barrels in 1984 to 1.0 trillion barrels in 1990.

Iraq was a closed police state, but Saddam Hussein’s objectives seemed clear: to dominate the Arab world, to gain hegemony over the Persian Gulf, to make Iraq into the predominant oil power—and ultimately to turn Greater Iraq into a global military power. But.

Over its entire history as an industry, oil has brought out both the best and worst of our civilization. It has been both boon and burden. Energy is the basis of industrial society. And of all energy sources, oil has loomed the largest and the most problematic because of its central role, its strategic character, its geographic distribution, the recurrent pattern of crisis in its supply—and the inevitable and irresistible temptation to grasp for its rewards.

Creativity, dedication, entrepreneur-ship, ingenuity, and technical innovation have coexisted with avarice, corruption, blind political ambition, and brute force.

It has given us our daily life and, literally, through agricultural chemicals and transportation, our daily bread.

The focus of the international community shifted from security to economics and growth and to what was coming to be known as globalization.

Of the world’s twenty largest oil companies, sixteen are state-owned.

The Russian industry is led by state-controlled giants Gazprom and Rosneft and as well by privately held companies, such as Lukoil, that are majors in their own right.

As such, The Prize is not only a history of the last 150 years. It is also a starting point for understanding how energy will shape the world of tomorrow.

One type of trap is a natural arch in the reservoir rock (fig.I–2) called a dome or anticline.

Two common sedimentary rocks that can be caprocks are shale and salt.

Seismic exploration is commonly used today to locate subsurface traps. The seismic method uses a source and detectors (fig.I–4). The source, such as dynamite, is located on or near the surface and gives off an impulse of sound energy into the subsurface. The sound energy bounces off sedimentary rock layers and returns to the surface to be recorded by the detectors. Sound echoes are used to image the shape of subsurface rock layers and find traps.Fig.I–3. Rock outcrops on surface above a dome Fig.I–4. The seismic method showing sound impulse bouncing off subsurface rock layer • xvi •.

Horizontal wells typically produce oil and gas at a greater rate than vertical wells.Fig.I–6. Well cutting removal by circulating drilling mud on bottom of well • xviii •.

The production rate from wells can be increased by acid and frac jobs. Acid is pumped down a well to dissolve some of the reservoir rock adjacent to the wellbore during an acid job. During a frac job, the reservoir rock is hydraulically fractured with a liquid pumped under high pressure down the well. Propping agents such as sand grains are pumped down the well with the frac fluid to hold the fractures open and allow the oil and gas to readily flow into the well.Periodically, production from the well must be interrupted for repairs or to clean out the well during a workover. A service company drives out to the well with a production unit to do the workover.

Ultimate recovery of gas from a gas reservoir is often about 80% of the gas in the reservoir.

Enhanced oil recovery involves pumping fluids such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or steam down injection wells to obtain more production.

At the refinery, there are two types of crude oils. An asphalt-based crude oil contains little or no paraffin wax and is usually black. When refined, it yields a large percentage of high-grade gasoline and asphalt. A paraffin-based crude oil contains little or no asphalt and is usually greenish. When refined, it yields a large percentage of paraffin wax, high-quality lubricating oil, and kerosene. A mixed-base crude oil is a combination of both types.

Freshwater has an °API gravity of 10. The °API gravities of crude oils vary from 5 to 55. Average density (weight) crude oils are 25 to 35. Light oils are 35 to 45. They are very fluid, often transparent, rich in gasoline, and the most valuable. Heavy oils are below 25. They are very viscous and dark colored, contain considerable asphalt, and are less valuable.

Sweet crudes have less than 1% sulfur by weight, whereas sour crudes have more than 1% sulfur.

A benchmark crude oil is a standard for a country against which other crude oils are compared, and prices are set. In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is 38 to 40°API gravity and 0.3% S, and West Texas Sour, a secondary benchmark, is 33 °API gravity and 1.6% S.Brent, the benchmark crude oil for the North Sea is very similar to WTI and is 38°API gravity and 0.3%S. Dubai is the benchmark crude oil for the Middle East at 31°API gravity and 2%S. Pour point All crude oils contain some paraffin molecules. If the paraffin molecules are 18 carbon atoms or longer in length, they are waxes that are solid at surface temperature. A crude oil that contains a significant amount of wax is called a waxy crude oil. In the subsurface reservoir where it is very hot, waxy crude oil occurs as a liquid. As the oil comes up the well, it cools, and the waxes can solidify. This can clog the tubing in the well and flowlines on the surface. The well then has to be shut in for a workover to clean out the wax. The amount of wax in crude oil is indicated by the pour point of the oil. A sample of the oil is heated in the laboratory. It is then poured from a container as it is being cooled. The lowest temperature at which the oil will still pour before it solidifies is called the pour point. Crude oil pour points range from +125° to −75°F (+52° to −59°C). Higher pour points reflect higher wax content. Cloud point is related to pour point. It is the temperature at which the oil first appears cloudy as wax forms when the temperature is lowered. It is 2° to 5°F (1° to 3°C) above the pour point. Very waxy crude oils are yellow in color. Slightly waxy crude oils can have a greenish color.Low- or no-wax oils are black. Crude oil from the Altamont area in the Uinta basin of Utah are very waxy with pour points ranging from +65° to +125°F (+18° to +52°C) and are heavy (19°API gravity) to light (54°API gravity)• 5 •.

Oil well production is measured in barrels of oil per day (bopd or b/d). The metric units of oil measurement are metric tons and cubic meters. A metric ton of average weight crude oil (30°API gravity) is 7.19 barrels in volume. A metric ton of heavy oil (20°API gravity) occupies 6.75 barrels, whereas a metric ton of light oil (40°API gravity) occupies 7.64 barrels. A cubic meter (m3 ) of oil equals 6.29 barrels of oil. Refining First, during the refining process, various components of crude oil are separated by their boiling points. In general, the longer the hydrocarbon molecule, the higher its boiling temperature. At the refinery, crude oil is heated in a furnace until most of it is vaporized.

The formation, dissolved, or solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) is the number of cubic feet of natural gas dissolved in one barrel of oil in the subsurface reservoir. The measurements are reported under surface conditions of temperature and pressure (standard cubic foot per barrel, or scf/bbl). In general, as the pressure of the reservoir increases with depth, the amount of natural gas that can be dissolved in crude oil increases.

The producing GOR of a well is the number of cubic feet of gas the well produces per barrel of oil.

Nonassociated natural gas is gas that is not in contact with oil in the subsurface, and it is almost pure methane. Associated natural gas occurs in contact with crude oil in the subsurface. It occurs both as gas in the free gas cap above the oil and gas dissolved in the crude oil. It contains other hydrocarbon gases besides methane.

In some subsurface gas reservoirs, at high temperatures, shorter-chain liquid hydrocarbons, primarily those with five to seven carbon atoms in length, occur as a gas. When the gas is produced, the temperature decreases, and the liquid hydrocarbons condense out of the gas on the surface. This liquid, called condensate, is almost pure gasoline, is clear to yellowish to.

Bluish in color, and has 45 to 62°API gravities. Condensate is commonly called casinghead gasoline, drip gasoline, white gas, or natural gasoline. It is often added to crude oil in the field in a process called spiking to decrease the °API gravity and increase the volume and value of the oil. Condensate removed from natural gas in the field is classified as crude oil by regulatory agencies.

Because of the low octane, the posted price for condensate is usually slightly less than that for crude oil. Natural gas that contains condensate is called wet gas, whereas natural gas lacking condensate is called dry gas. The condensate along with butane, propane, and ethane that can be removed from natural gas are referred to as natural gas liquids (NGL.

It is usually 60°F and 14.65 psi (15°C and 101.325 kPa) and is called standard cubic feet (scf ). The abbreviation for 1,000 cubic feet is Mcf, a million cubic feet is MMcf, a billion cubic feet is Bcf, and a trillion cubic feet is Tcf. Condensate content is measured in barrels per million cubic feet (BCPMM) of gas. In the metric system, the volume of gas is measured in cubic meters (m3 ). A cubic meter is equal to 35.315 cf. The unit used to measure heat content of fuel such as gas in the English system is the British thermal unit (Btu). One Btu is about the amount of heat given off by burning one wooden match. Pipeline natural gas ranges from 900 to 1,200 Btus per cubic foot and is commonly 1,000 Btus. The heat content varies with the hydrocarbon composition and the amount of inerts in the natural gas. Heat content in the metric system is measured in kilojoules. A kilojoule of heat is equal to about 1 Btu. Natural gas is sold to a pipeline by volume in thousands of cubic feet, by the amount of heat when burned in Btus, or by a combination of both. If the pipeline contract has a Btu adjustment clause, the gas is bought at a certain price per Mcf, and the price is then adjusted for the Btu content of the gas. The amount of Btus in one average barrel of crude oil is equivalent to the Btus in 6,040 cubic feet of average natural gas and is called barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). Different companies often have a slightly different BOE numbers depending on the oil and gas composition of their production• 11 •.

Both black and volatile oils are liquid in the subsurface reservoir. Black oil or low-shrinkage oil has a relatively high percentage of long, heavy, nonvolatile molecules. It is usually black but can have a greenish or brownish color. Black oil has an initial producing GOR of 2,000 scf/bbl or less. The °API gravity is below 45.

Volatile oil or high-shrinkage oil has relatively more intermediate size molecules that are shorter than black oil molecules. The color is brown, orange, or green. Volatile oil has an initial producing GOR between 2,000 and 3,300 scf/bbl. The °API gravity is 40 or above. Retrograde gas is a gas in the reservoir under original pressure, but liquid condensate forms in the subsurface reservoir as the pressure decreases with production. The initial GOR is 3,300 scf/bbl or higher. Wet gas occurs entirely as a gas in the reservoir, even during production, but produces a liquid condensate on the surface.

They are called boulder, cobble, pebble, granule, sand, silt, and clay-sized particles.

In some areas of the earth, there are no, or very few, sedimentary rocks, and the basement rock is on or near the surface. These areas are called shields, and there is no gas or oil.

A shield, such as the Canadian shield in eastern Canada, tends to be a large, low-lying area.

Ore minerals such as iron, copper, lead, zinc, gold, and silver are mined from the basement rock in shield areas.

There are about 600 sedimentary rock basins in the world. Of the basins that have been explored and drilled, about 40% are productive. About 90% of the world’s oil occurs in only 30 of those basins.

First is the number of cleavage surfaces of different directions. The second is the quality of the surfaces, such as poor or excellent. The third is the angle between the surfaces. Fracture is the breakage of the mineral along an irregular surface. The hardness of a mineral is quantified by Moh’s scale, which ranges from 1 to 10. The mineral talc is the softest (1), and diamond is the hardest (10). A mineral that is higher on Moh’s scale can scratch a mineral that is lower on the scale. Some common objects that are used for hardness comparisons are a fingernail (2.5), a copper penny (3.5), a knife or steel key (6), and glass (7). Specific gravity is the relative weight of a mineral compared to the weight of an equal volume of water. A specific gravity of 2.5 means the mineral weighs 2.5 times an equal volume of water. The specific gravity of an average rock or mineral is about 2.5. Ore minerals mined for metals, such as iron, copper, or nickel, are heavy and have specific gravities of 3.5 and above. Certain minerals have unique characteristics that can be used to identify them. The mineral halite (common table salt) can be identified by its taste. A very important test is the application of cold, dilute acid to a sample, which causes only the mineral calcite to bubble. a b Fig.3–1.Cleavage: (a) one perfect cleavage and (b) three perfect cleavages, not at right angles • 26 •.

Quartz is the hardest of the common minerals (7 on the Moh’s scale).

A foliated metamorphic rock has parallel, platy crystals (fig.3–2a). Nonfoliated metamorphic rock has either uniform-sized crystals or a nonparallel orientation of platy crystals (fig.3–2b).

Granite is the most common plutonic igneous rock. It has the coarsegrained texture characteristic of all plutonic rocks. Granite is composed of the minerals quartz, feldspar, biotite, and hornblende. Quartz grains are the most common, giving granite a light color (plate 3–2a). The dark-colored mineral grains give it a speckled texture. Some granites are reddish or pinkish from iron impurities. Granite is commonly used for building stone. Basalt is the most common volcanic rock. It has the fine-grained texture characteristic of lava. Basalt is black to gray in color (plate 3–2b). In some instances, the basalt coming out of a volcano cooled so rapidly that gas bubbles were frozen in the basalt. Fragments of basalt with numerous gas bubbles are called scoria.

A conglomerate is commonly deposited in a river channel or on an alluvial fan formed where a mountain stream empties into the desert. If the particles are angular, the rock is called breccia.

The darker the shale, the higher the organic content.

Black shales are common source rocks for gas and oil. A gray shale can be a caprock on a reservoir rock in a petroleum trap. Mudstone is similar to shale but is composed of both silt- and clay-sized grains.

Colored varieties of chert include jasper, chalcedony, and agate.

Many sedimentary rocks are a combination of these three types and are described as sandy, shaly, and limey or calcareous.

Petrified wood is formed by the replacement of wood by silicon dioxide, which preserves the grain structure of the wood. Trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or trails, are indirect evidence of ancient life.Fig.4–5. Fossils Certain species of plants and animals lived during certain geologic times. They eventually became extinct (disappeared from the earth) and were replaced by newer plants and animals. This continuous succession of organisms throughout geologic time is known as evolution. Vertical sequences of sedimentary rock layers that have been relative age dated can be used to determine the relative ages of the fossils in those rock layers (fig.4–6). Geologists have collected and established the relative ages of most fossils. The evolutionary sequence of the fossils can be used to relative age date any sedimentary rocks that contain those fossils. In figure 4–7, the rocks labeled A are older than those labeled B• 37 •.

Guide or index fossil is a distinctive plant or animal that lived during a relatively short span of geologic time.

A fossil assemblage is a group of fossils found in the same sedimentary rocks.

Paleo picks can also be used to determine if the sedimentary rock layers in a well are higher or lower in elevation than those in a well that has already been drilled (fig.

Spores and pollens given off by plants to reproduce also are good microfossils. Scientists who study fossils are called paleontologists, and those who specialize in microfossils are micropaleontologists. Because they pick microfossils (bugs) from well cuttings to examine them under a microscope, they are often called bug pickers. Micropaleontologists specializing in spores and pollens are called palynologists or weed and seed people.

During the Jurassic period, the middle period of the Mesozoic, mammals appeared. They were small and were dominated by the reptiles throughout the remainder of the Mesozoic.

This extinction was caused when an asteroid made of rock hit the earth. It was at least 6 miles (10 km) in diameter and hit the earth head on with a speed of about 60,000 miles per hour (100,000 km/h).

Weathering, Erosion, and Unconformities.

A disconformity is an erosional channel in which the sedimentary rock layers above and below the erosional surface are parallel.

Angular unconformities can form gas and oil traps (fig.

Most anticlines and synclines are not level and are tilted with respect to the surface of the earth. These are called plunging anticlines (fig.5–8) and plunging synclines.

The formation of anticlines and synclines results in shortening of the earth’s crust (fig.5–10). Forces that shorten the earth’s crust are compressional.

Sedimentary rocks dipping uniformly in one direction are known as a homocline (fig.

Joint is a fracture in the rocks with no movement of one side relative to the other.

Any naturally fractured rock is a potential reservoir rock.

Faults are breaks in the rocks along which one side has moved relative to the other (plate.

Dip-slip faults move primarily up and down, whereas strike-slip faults move primarily horizontally.Oblique-slip faults have roughly equal dip-slip and strike-slip displacements.

If the hanging wall has moved down relative to the footwall, it is a normal dip-slip fault (fig.

Series of parallel, normal dip-slip faults forms a structure called horst and graben (fig.5–19). A graben is the down-dropped block between two normal faults. A horst is the ridge left standing between two grabens. These can range in size from inches to tens of miles across.Fig.5–19. Horst and graben If the hanging wall has moved up relative to the footwall, it is a reverse dip-slip fault. In a reverse dip-slip fault, some subsurface beds overlap. It is possible to drill through this fault and encounter the same rock layers twice in a double section (fig.5–20). A thrust fault is a reverse fault with a fault plane less than 45° from horizontal (fig.5–21). On a thrust fault, the upper • 62 •.

Reverse dip-slip fault is formed by shortening the rocks with compressional forces (fig.5–22). When the earth’s crust is pulled apart, normal dip-slip faults with horsts and grabens are formed. When the earth’s crust is squeezed, reverse dip-slip and thrust faults and folds, such as anticlines and synclines, are formed.Fig.5–22. Forces that form a normal dip-slip fault and a reverse dip-slip fault Faults can be both active and inactive. When a fault moves, it can produce shock waves called an earthquake. Many faults, however, moved a long time ago and are inactive today. Two very large faults occur in Oklahoma, the Seneca and Nemaha faults. Both were active hundreds of millions of years ago but are inactive today.Dip-slip faults form traps by displacing the reservoir rock (fig.5–23). The fault must be a sealing fault, which means it prevents fluid flow across or along the fault. Any gas and oil migrating up a reservoir rock will be trapped under the sealing fault. The largest oil field on land in England is the Wytch Farm field, located southwest of London on the South Dorset coast. There are natural oil seeps along the coast, and the field was discovered in 1973. The trap was formed by a fault cutting the Sherwood Sandstone reservoir rock (fig.5–24). It contains 286 million bbl (45 million m3 ) of recoverable oil• 64 •.

Seaward of the continental shelf and slope break is the continental slope that extends down to the bottom of the ocean. It has a slope of about 3˚ and is the geological edge of the continents.

Submarine canyons are eroded, and sediments are transported down submarine canyons by turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are masses of water with suspended sediments such as sand, silt, and clay. The turbidity current is denser than the surrounding seawater and is pulled by gravity down the submarine canyon similar to river water being pulled by gravity down a river channel on land. Turbidity currents can originate from rivers with a large sediment load flowing into the ocean. Like rivers on land, they erode submarine canyons offshore.

Turbidity current will continue to flow down a submarine canyon as long as a slope exists. When the turbidity current flows onto the relatively flat ocean bottom, it stops, and the sediments settle out of the water. The coarsest sediments (usually sand) settle out first and the finest sediments (silt and then clay) settle out last. This deposits a graded bed (fig.6–3) with the coarsest sediments on the bottom and the finest on the top. Accumulations of turbidity current sediments at the base of a submarine canyon form a large sedimentary deposit called a submarine fan (fig.6–2). A channel usually leads out of the submarine canyon and divides into smaller distributary channels on the submarine fan.

The sands in turbidity current deposits are called turbidites and can be reservoirs (fig.6–4) for gas and oil. Relatively thin sandstones separated by shales are characteristic of submarine fan reservoirs deposited as graded beds. Relatively.

Was formed by a stratigraphic trap, a type of petroleum trap formed by a reservoir rock completely encased in shale that is both the source rock for the gas and the caprock for the reservoir. Stratigraphic trap fields often take the shape of the reservoir rock. A map of the Frigg field • 70 •.

The deepest parts of the seafloor are ocean trenches that are long, narrow depressions usually located along the margins of the oceans. Adjacent to many deep ocean trenches are active volcanic islands.

The center of the ridge typically has a rift valley (graben.

Observations from submarines have shown that active basalt volcanoes occur all along the floor of the submerged graben on the crest of the mid-ocean ridge.

The average sediment thickness on the ocean bottom is about ½ mile (0.8 km). This is unevenly distributed. Sediments are very thick along the edge of the oceans in continental shelves and slopes and thin or absent on the mid-ocean ridge.

Because of lack of sedimentary rocks, no one will ever drill a well for gas or oil near the center of the ocean.

The crust of the earth under continents is granite in composition and is 20 to 45 miles (32 to 72 km) thick. The crust under oceans is basalt lava rock in composition and is only about 3 miles (5 km) thick.

The crust of the earth under continents is granite in composition and is 20 to 45 miles (32 to 72 km) thick. The crust under oceans is basalt lava rock in composition and is only about 3 miles (5 km) thick. Continents are high in elevation because they are composed primarily of granite that is relatively light in density compared.

The solid rock above the partially melted rocks is called the lithosphere (fig.6–9). It is about 90 miles (145 km) thick below continents and about 60 miles (97 km) thick below oceans.Fig.6–9. Cross section of the earth’s crust and lithosphere Continental Drift The theory of continental drift dates back to the early 1900s. It suggests that all the present-day continents were previously joined into one supercontinent, Pangaea (fig.6–10). During the early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago, Pangaea broke up. The fragments of the supercontinent drifted (moved) across the face of the earth into their present positions to form the modern continents. The theory was not widely accepted at first. It was not known what process would cause Pangaea to break up and the continents to move• 74 •.

The seafloor is spreading out from several mid-ocean ridges in different oceans. Areas where seafloors from two different mid-ocean ridges collide are called subduction zones. There are three types of subduction zones.First,.

Present, there are eight large plates and many smaller ones.

The modern day theory of plate tectonics, suggested in 1967, combines the ideas of seafloor spreading and continental drift. Plate tectonics postulates that the solid lithosphere of the earth is divided into large, moving plates (fig.6–16). Every location on the earth’s surface, whether a continent or a seafloor, is on a moving plate that is sliding across the partially molten rocks below it. Each plate originates at a mid-ocean ridge where new seafloor is being formed. The plate is moving at right angles away from the crest of the ridge at the spreading rate of that ridge. At the opposite side of the plate from the mid-ocean ridge is a subduction zone, an ocean trench, and/or a mountain range. Large strike-slip faults occur where different plates scrape against each other. Continents ride along on the moving plates.Fig.6–16. Cross section of plates At present, there are eight large plates and many smaller ones (fig.6–17). The North American Plate is moving to the west at 1 in/yr (2.5 cm/yr). Below California and off the west coast of the United States and Canada, the North American Plate is obliquely colliding with the Pacific Plate, • 79 •.

In the geologic past, the number and size of the plates have varied along with their rates and directions.

The initial breakup of a continent by plate tectonics can take the form of a triple junction. A triple junction has three rifts (arms) that join in the center (fig.6–19).Usually, two of the arms unite and continue rifting to form an ocean. The other arm stops spreading and is called a failed arm. A failed arm is a graben that can be filled with sediments.

Failed arms are oil and gas producers. During the Mesozoic breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, several triple-junctions with failed arms formed. As North America separated from Europe, a triple junction formed near the present-day North Sea. Two arms joined to become the.

Several failed arms are oil and gas producers.

The large petroleum traps of the Middle East (fig.6–22) were formed by plate tectonics. Almost all the Middle East oil field traps are anticlines and domes. The mid-ocean ridge in the Red Sea (fig.6–8) is causing Saudi Arabia on the Arabian Plate to move northeastward and collide with the Eurasian Plate. The Persian Gulf area is being compressed between the two plates, forming the Middle East Field traps. The deformation becomes more intense in a northeastward direction from Saudi Arabia toward Iran and Iraq and forms the Zargos Mountains. Saudi Arabia alone has 85 fields with 325 reservoirs containing 25% of the world’s oil reserves. The Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia is the largest conventional oil field on earth. The trap is an anticline 174 miles (280 km) long and up to 18.6 miles (30 km) wide (fig.6–23a). The reservoir rock is fractured and dissolved limestone, the Jurassic age Arab D Limestone with an average oil pay zone of 200 ft (60 m). The reservoir rock is not very deep (−1,500 ft or −457 m below sea level). Salt layers in the overlying Hith Formation are the seal (fig.6–23b). The source rock is a Jurassic age black limestone. The average production of a Ghawar well is 11,400 bbl (1,800 m3 ) of oil per day, • 83 •.

The city of Los Angeles is located on the Los Angeles basin.

The Los Angeles basin (fig.7–3) is the most prolific oil basin on earth. There are 61 oil fields that have produced over 9 billion bbl (1.4 billion m3 ) of oil.

Half-graben basins are formed by subsidence along one side of a normal fault (fig.7–4). These basins are common and are productive in the North Sea, offshore western Africa, and offshore Brazil• 88 •.

Most mountain ranges on land were formed by the compression of sedimentary rocks when plates collided (see figs.6–14 and 6–15 in chapter 6). They display large compressional features such as anticlines, synclines, reverse faults, and thrust faults. Mountain ranges, however, are relatively unproductive because most petroleum reservoirs have been breached by erosion, and the oil and gas have leaked out. In many areas, the sedimentary rocks have been eroded away, exposing the basement rock. Many of the remaining sedimentary rocks in the mountains have been metamorphosed by the high heat and pressure that occurred during the compression. Only intermontane basins, which form between mountain peaks, are good areas to explore for oil and gas. Intermontane basins form when mountain ranges are created. The basin is located between the mountain peaks and is often occupied by a lake. Algae growing in the lake contribute organic matter to the bottom sediments for source rocks.Streams, eroding the surrounding mountains, deposit numerous channel and beach sandstone reservoir rocks in the basin. When the Rocky Mountains were uplifted during the Cretaceous time, several intermontane basins were formed. Many of these basins, such as the Big Horn, Powder River, Green River, and Uinta basins, are good petroleum producers today (fig.7–5). Basins also form along the edges of mountains. As the mountains are eroded by streams, sediments fill in the areas adjacent to the mountains. The Alberta, Denver-Julesburg, and Raton basins formed in this manner• 90 •.

Coastal plains are formed by thick sediments deposited adjacent to an ocean (.

They originate when mountains are uplifted adjacent to a coast. As erosion lowers the mountains, streams deposit sands along the beaches, and waves carry the silts and clays offshore. The sandy beaches are deposited out into the ocean, forming the coastal plain. The Gulf of Mexico coastal plain was created by this process. Because the sediments on the surface are young and have never been buried, they are loose and uncemented (unconsolidated). The Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the United States were deposited by sediments eroded from the Appalachian and Ouachita mountains, which rose during the Pennsylvanian period. Underlying the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain is 40,000 to 60,000 ft (12,000 to 18,000 m) of sedimentary rocks. This area is one of the most prolific petroleum-producing areas of the world. The Atlantic coastal plain, however, is barren for gas and oil, possibly due to the lack of source rocks• 91 •.

All maps are oriented with north to the top, south to the bottom, east to the right, and west to the left.

If the contours are spaced relatively close together, the elevation is changing rapidly, and the slope is steep. If the contours are relatively far apart, the slope is gentle.

There are some important characteristics of contours on a topographic map. Contour lines never cross. Contour lines are single lines; they never branch. Contour lines are continuous; they always close or run off the map and never end on the map. Elevations can be accurately estimated from a topographic map. If a point is on the +300 ft contour, it must be, by definition, exactly 300 ft above sea level. If the point is about halfway between the +300 and +400 ft contour, an elevation of +350 ft is a good estimate. The shape of the contours is characteristic for many topographic features such as hills, ridges, and canyons. A topographic map (or any contoured map) cannot be drawn without some accurately surveyed points. After the elevations or values are located on a map (spotted), contours can be drawn between the points. Contouring • 100 •.

The basic sedimentary rock layer used for geologic mapping is called a formation.

Each formation has a two-part name. The first part is a town where the layer crops out on the surface. The second part is the dominant rock type, such as sandstone or limestone. San Andreas Limestone, Bartlesville Sandstone, and Barnett Shale are formation names.

The orientation of rock layers, the third dimension, is shown with a strike-and-dip symbol. Strike is the horizontal orientation of a plane (fig.8–6a), such as a sedimentary rock layer or a fault. It is measured with a compass orientation, such as north 30˚ east. Strike is shown as a short line on the geological map (fig.8–6b) that is oriented in the measured compass direction. Dip is the direction and vertical angle of the plane. It is measured perpendicular (90˚) to the strike (fig.8–6a). The dip symbol on the map is a small bar attached to the middle of the strike line (fig.8–6b). It points in the direction that the plane goes down into the earth. The angle in degrees is often on the dip symbol.

Base map is a map that shows the location of all the wells that have been drilled in an area.

Shale.

Shale is the most common sedimentary rock, and many are black. A black shale commonly has 1 to 3% organic matter by weight and can have up to 20%.

It occurs from about 7,000 to 18,000 ft (2,100 to 5,500 m) deep on land.

The most common trap is a saturated pool, which always has a free gas cap on top of the oil reservoir (fig.9–4a). The oil in the reservoir has dissolved all the natural gas it can hold and is saturated. An unsaturated pool lacks a free gas cap (fig.9–4b). The oil has some dissolved gas, but it can hold more and is unsaturated. Sometimes there is only a gas reservoir on water.

The boundary in the reservoir between the free gas cap and the oil is the gas-oil contact (fig.9–5). The boundary between the oil and water reservoir is the oil-water contact. The gas-oil and oil-water contacts are either relatively sharp or gradational and are usually level. The top of the trap is called the crest. The.

Leak onto the surface. Two common caprocks are shales and salt layers.Well-cemented or shaly rocks, very-fine-grained limestone (micrite or chalk), and permafrost can also be caprocks.

Giant oil field has at least 500 million bbl of recoverable oil, and a super giant has at least 5 billion bbl of recoverable oil. A giant gas field has at least 3 Tcf of recoverable gas, and a supergiant gas field has at least 20 Tcf of recoverable gas.

Natural gas compresses and needs less porosity than an oil reservoir. Very deep gas reservoirs need very little porosity because of the very high pressure.

Primary pores are formed on the surface when the sediments are deposited, for example, between the sediment grains. Secondary pores are formed in the subsurface by processes such as solution and fracturing.

The only way to make a quantitative permeability measurement is to drill a core of the reservoir rock and cut a plug. The plug is dried to remove any liquids. An instrument called a permeameter is used to measure the permeability of the dried plug by measuring the flow of air or nitrogen through it. Typical permeability values of an oil reservoir rock are given in table 9–2. Gas is about 50 times more fluid than oil and needs less permeability than an oil reservoir• 121 •.

A constructive delta (fig.10–12a) is shaped by river deposition. Wave erosion is relatively minor. A constructive delta has lobes of sediments that protrude into the ocean. The Mississippi River Delta is an example. A destructive delta (fig.10–12b) is shaped by wave erosion. It.

The Niger River Delta is one of the world’s greatest oil-producing areas, with more than 41 billion bbl (6.5 billion m3 ) of recoverable oil in ancient beach and river channel sandstones.Fig.10–19. Map of present-day and ancient shorelines and their ages on the Niger River Delta, Nigeria.(Modified from Burke, 1972. ) Granite Wash Granite wash is a potential reservoir rock formed by the weathering of granite. The rock granite is composed of large, well-sorted, sand-sized mineral grains and weathers to form well-sorted sandstone that can be very thick. After the granite and granite wash have been buried in the subsurface, oil and gas can form in source rocks at a lower elevation. The oil and gas can then migrate up and into the granite wash (fig.10–20). Granite wash reservoir rocks are common in the subsurface of southern and western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. The Elk City field of Oklahoma produces from granite wash where it has been uplifted by an anticline.

A limestone platform is a large area covered with shallow tropical seas where limestones are being deposited.

As it flows over the limestone platform, calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water forming sand- and silt-sized spheres called oolites. Limestones.

Composed of oolites are called oolitic limestones. They have excellent original porosity and can be good reservoir rock.

Dolomite is difficult to distinguish from limestone in the field. Dolomite and limestone have a similar crystal shape, color, and hardness. Limestone will bubble in cold, diluted acid.Dolomite, however, will bubble only in hot, concentrated acid.Rhomb-shaped crystals that will not bubble in cold, diluted acid are the best field indication of dolomite. In.

The faults can sometimes be barriers to fluid flow and are called sealing faults.

The contacts are at different elevations in the same reservoir rock on opposite.

Oil-water and gas-oil contacts in reservoirs are level. If the contacts are at different elevations in the same reservoir rock on opposite sides of the fault, the fault is a sealing fault. If there are different fluid pressures at the same elevation on opposite sides of the fault, the fault is a sealing fault.

In an area where large volumes of loose sediments are rapidly deposited, such as deltas and coastal plains, a unique type of fault, a growth or downto-the-basin fault, forms. The fault is always parallel to and located just inland from the shoreline (.

Is called a growth fault because it moves as the sediments are being deposited.

Growth faults are unique in that they have a curved fault plane that is concave toward the basin.

The fault is steep near the surface and becomes less steep with depth.

Faults in solid rocks tend to have straight fault planes. The growth fault, however, occurs in loose sediments.

Drag folds are formed by friction generated along a fault plane when a fault moves. Friction causes the beds on either side of the fault to be dragged up on one side and down on the other side of the fault.

Compressional features such as folds, reverse faults, and thrust faults. The thrust faults occur in zones called overthrust or disturbed belts that parallel the mountain ranges. The most drilled of these overthrust belts is the Rocky Mountain or Western overthrust or disturbed belt of the United States and Canada (fig.11–15). Thrust faulting occurred from the Cretaceous through Eocene time during the formation of the mountains. A west-to-east cross section shows the deformation of the earth’s crust (fig.11–16). Several of the thrust faults moved tens of miles horizontally. In Wyoming and Utah, the 1,000 ft (305 m) thick Jurassic age Nugget Sandstone has been deformed into large subsurface drag folds along the thrust faults. These are the targets for Rocky Mountain overthrust drilling. The Painter reservoir field, Wyoming, discovered in 1977, is a typical overthrust field. A more detailed, east-west cross section (fig.11–17) shows the numerous thrust faults and the drag fold trap in the Nugget Sandstone at 10,000 ft (3,050 m) below the surface. A larger-scale, east-west cross section of the field (fig.11–18) shows more faulting and the complex deformation in more detail. The oil and gas pay zone is more than 770 ft (235 m) thick• 167 •.

There are two areas for drilling on salt domes (fig.11–39). Above the salt dome, any shallow reservoir rocks such as sandstones are domed. Near the top of the salt dome, uplift has caused the overlying sedimentary rocks to be faulted with normal faults that sometimes form grabens. These form fault traps. Because the caprock is often fractured and porous, it can be productive reservoir rock. Deep along the flanks of the salt dome, reservoir rocks that were uplifted.

Drillers selected the drillsites while envisioning large, flowing underground rivers and subterranean crevasses filled with oil. Geologists were seldom used to select drillsites. Once an oil field was discovered, the “closeology” principle applied. The closer a proposed well was to a producing well, the better the proposed well was.

Two criteria must be met on a structural map to locate a drillsite. It must be a high area on the reservoir rock, and it must have four-sided closure. If the reservoir rock is filled with water, then any gas or oil, being lighter than water, will migrate to the high area in the reservoir rock.Four-sided closure means that the trap (high area) goes down on all four sides.

The trap can be filled down to a level, called the spill point, at which it cannot hold any more.

Is the highest point on the rim of an anticline or dome. The vertical distance from the crest of the reservoir rock down to the spill point is the closure of the trap.

Constructing a cross section, a vertical slice or panel of the subsurface rocks, by correlation is used to find gas and oil traps. Correlation is the matching of rock layers from one well to another.

Marker bed is a distinctive rock layer that is easy to identify. Volcanic ash layers; thin beds of coal, limestone, or sandstone; and fossil zones are good marker beds.

Fence diagram is used to show how wells correlate in three dimensions (fig.12–9). The diagram is arranged like a map. North is at the top, south at the bottom, east to the right, and west to the left. Each well is located (spotted) on the map. The well log for each well is drawn vertically under the well’s position. The rock layers are then correlated from one well log to another. Each set of correlations forms a panel. The entire diagram is called a fence diagram• 202 •.

With sequence stratigraphy, correlation between wells log is made using unconformities rather than rock layers.

It recognizes that unconformities, ancient erosional surfaces, represent an instant of geological time. These unconformities were formed when sea level was relatively low and the land was exposed to erosion during the cyclic rise and fall of sea level (see chap.2, fig.2–7). The rocks between two unconformities were deposited during a specific interval of time called a parasequence set. This corresponds to the fourth-order cycle of sea level rise and fall. Parasequence sets can be subdivided into smaller time interval units bounded by smaller unconformities called parasequences that correspond to the fifth-order cycles of sea level rise and fall. Geologists can better predict where source rocks and reservoir rocks are located in parasequence sets and parasequences (fig.12–10) than they can using traditional rock formations. A lot of subsurface information from wells, no matter who drilled them, eventually becomes public. A company drilling an exploratory well in a new area might want to keep as much information as secret as possible by running a tight hole. The information can then be used by the tight hole operator to locate other wellsites and leasing any land that is still open (loose acreage).However, state, provincial, and federal laws require that a specific suite of well logs be released to the government regulatory agency within a certain time. This time limit varies; it is one year in the states of Oklahoma and Texas. For US offshore federal land, it is 5 or 10 years. After being released to the government, these logs immediately become public information. In many countries, there is a national oil company that partners with any foreign oil company drilling in that country. Because the foreign oil companies have a common partner in the national oil company, well information can be obtained through that source• 204 •.

The rocks between two unconformities were deposited during a specific interval of time called a parasequence set.

The API assigns a 10- or 12-digit number called the API number to every well drilled in the United States. Digits 1 and 2 are state codes; digits 3 through 5 are for county, parish, or offshore; digits 6 through 10 identify the well; and digits 11 and 12 record a well property such as sidetracking.

Vitrinite reflectance is a method used to determine the maturity of a source rock. Vitrinite is a type of plant organic matter often found in black shale.

Play is a combination of trap, reservoir rock, and seal that has been shown by previously discovered fields to contain commercial petroleum deposits in an area.

Trend or fairway is the area along which the play has been proven and more fields could be found.

Prospect is the exact location where the geological and economic conditions are favorable for drilling an exploratory well. A prospect can be presented by using prospect maps that illustrate the reasoning for selecting that drilling location.

Location. The maps include at least a structure and isopach map of the drilling target and a map of test results and fluid recoveries from wells in the area. An economic analysis of the prospect should include reserves and risk calculations. There are four major geological factors (essential elements) in the success of a particular prospect.First, there must have been a source rock that generated petroleum.Second, there must be a reservoir rock to hold the petroleum.Third, there must be a trap. This includes a reservoir rock configuration that has four-sided closure, a seal on the reservoir rock, and no breach of the trap.Fourth, the timing must be right. The trap had to be in position before the petroleum migrated through the area. Geologists have put together petroleum systems for all petroleumproducing areas of the world. A petroleum system is a volume of sedimentary rocks that includes a source rock that is or has generated oil and gas and all the seeps and accumulations of that oil and gas. It can be an entire basin or part of a basin. The essential elements that include source rock, reservoir rock, seal, and overlying sediments in that petroleum system are identified. The timing of processes that include trap formation and petroleum generation, migration, and accumulation for that petroleum system are determined. The petroleum system is named after the source rock and reservoir rock such as the Mandal-Ekofisk petroleum system of the North Sea and the Akata-Agbada petroleum system of the Niger River Delta of Nigeria• 209 •.

The gravity meter does not work well in either an airplane or the ocean because of vibrations.

Amplitude versus offset (AVO) is an analysis of seismic data to locate gas reservoirs and help identify the composition of the rock layers. Offset is the distance between the seismic source and the receiver. The amplitude of a reflection usually decreases with increasing offset distance. Gas reservoirs and different sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, limestones, and shales have different reflection amplitudes versus offsets. Some increase, and others decrease with offset.

Investment (ROI) and payout (PO). Return on investment is the net revenue from oil and gas production sales.

Two common methods of evaluating a drilling prospect are return on investment (ROI) and payout (PO). Return on investment is the net revenue from oil and gas production sales divided by the maximum cash outlay for drilling and completion. Because money is spent immediately for drilling and completion and the revenue from oil and gas production sales is spread out over many years after that, the time value of money must be considered by discounting. Tables with an annual discount rate are used to determine what the present value of the money is when received at a later date. For example, $100 of net oil and gas production revenue 10 years from now at a discount rate of 15% is worth only $24.72 in present value today. Present value is used in the ROI calculation that is then multiplied.

The economic value of drilling a prospect can also be evaluated by the internal rate of return (IRR). It is the investment rate, such as 20%, that applied to the cost of drilling and completing a well will equal the net revenue interest from oil and gas production sales over the life of the well. Some companies set a minimum IRR before drilling is approved. If the drilling project does not meet that minimum IRR, the money can be better spend on another investment.

The start of drilling a well is called spudding in. Spudding in a medium or deep well usually begins with a small truck-mounted rig that drills a largediameter but shallow hole (20 to 100 ft or 7 to 30 m) called the conductor hole.

If the tower comes on a tractor-trailer and is jacked up as a unit, it is a mast.

The derrick or mast is the steel tower directly above the well that supports the crown block at the top and provides support.

For the drillpipe to be stacked vertically as it is pulled from the well.

If the tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick.

If the tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick. All offshore rigs use derricks. Derricks and masts are commonly 80 to 187 ft (24.4 to 57 m) tall to accommodate two, three, or four joints of vertical drillpipe in a stand. They have a square cross section with four vertical legs made of structural steel. The horizontal structural members between the legs are called girts (fig.15–4). The diagonal members are braces. An inverted, V-shaped opening in the front of the derrick or mast called the V-door allows drillpipe and casing to be pulled up the pipe ramp onto the drill floor. Derricks and masts are rated for maximum drillpipe load. They are also rated for wind load and can commonly withstand winds of 100 to 130 miles per hour (160 to 208 km/hr). The base of the mast or derrick is a flat, steel surface called the drill, derrick, or rig floor, where most of the drilling activity occurs. Two substructures made of a steel framework 10 to 30 ft (3 to 10 m) high can be used to raise the drill floor above the ground (plate 15–1). This is done to provide space for wellhead equipment below the drill floor such as the blowout preventers (BOPs) when drilling a deep well• 251 •.

The tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick. All offshore rigs use derricks.

The next joint of drillpipe used to make a connection (fig.15–9a) is kept in a hole in the drill floor called the mouse hole.

A stabilizer is a common sub (fig.15–11) that uses blades to contact the well walls. It is designed to keep the drillstring central in the well. A vibration dampener or shock sub uses rubber, springs, or compressed gas to absorb vibrations from the bit. It is usually run just above the bit. A bit sub is used to make the connection between a bit and the drill collar or sub above it. A crossover sub is used to make a connection between two different sizes of pipe or two different thread types. A hole opener (fig.15–12) uses roller cones to enlarge the wellbore. A reamer has three or six tungsten steel rollers along its sides and is often run above the bit to provide a gauge hole. A gauge hole is a hole with a specific minimum diameter. The.

This bit is designed to continuously shear away the rocks to produce cuttings.

A worn bit can be detected from the change in noise that the drillpipe makes from the drill floor and by a decrease in rate of penetration.

Derrick or mast (plate 14–2). The pipe is usually pulled.

The pipe is usually pulled and unscrewed three joints (a tribble) at a time, and is called a stand.

The rate of temperature increase is called the geothermal gradient. It averages 2°F/100 ft (3.6°C/100 m) for the earth but varies between 0.5° to 5°F/100 ft (1° to 9°C/100 m).

Jar is often used in the fishing string above the tool. The jar is a section of pipe that either mechanically or hydraulically imparts a sharp upward or downward jolt to the tool on command (fig.16–4). Explosives can be used to blow up the junk. The pieces are then retrieved with a magnet or junk basket.

Mechanical pipe sticking is often caused by a dogleg in the well. A dogleg is any deviation in the well greater than 3˚ per 100 ft.(30 m). Doglegs are caused by drilling through dipping hard rock layers or a change in the weight on the bit during drilling. A dogleg can result in keyseating, the formation of a wellbore cross section in the form of a key hole (fig.16–5). It is caused by the drillpipe abrading a groove in the side of the well that is smaller that the hole drilled by the bit. Larger diameter drill collars cannot pass through the keyseat. The well has to be enlarged by reamers. Ledges are hard rock layers that ring the wellbore and can cause pipe sticking. They are formed when drilling through alternating layers of hard and soft rocks. The soft rock washes out above and below the hard rock layers to form ledges. A stuck-point indicator tool or stuck-pipe log can be run to determine exactly where (stuck point) the pipe is stuck. A back-off operation is performed as a last resort. The stuck pipe can be cut with either a string shot or a chemical cutter. A string shot uses an explosive cord that is detonated one joint above the stuck point while the pipe is being unscrewed. A chemical cutter (fig.16–6) is run on a wireline and activated by an electrical signal. It uses a chemical propellant, a hot, corrosive fluid that jets out of the cutter under high pressure to slice through the pipe. After the pipe is cut, a washpipe (fig.16–3c) is then run on a fishing string to wash around the stuck pipe and detach it from the well wall. Wall sticking can be prevented by using spiral-grooved drill collars (fig.16–7). The three grooves, located 120˚ apart, decrease the area of pipe in contact with the well walls but have little effect on the weight and strength of the pipe• 283 •.

Horizontal wells are also used in low-permeability (tight) formations to increase ultimate recovery from the reservoir. They are also used to prevent coning, which produces excessive gas or water from above or below the oil reservoir (chapter 24.

Completing a well usually costs more money than drilling a well.

A core, a cylinder of rock drilled from the well, is the most accurate source of information about the reservoir. A full-diameter core ranges in diameter from 1¾ to 5¼ in.(4.4 to 13.3 cm) and can be up to 400 ft (122 m) long but is commonly 20 to 90 ft (6.1 to 27.4.m) long.

As a general rule, in an 8-in.(20-cm) hole, it takes about 10 minutes for mud to circulate each 1,000 ft (305 m.

You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon rises, Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest.

Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never wrong.

Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only people who can’t get into it do that.

To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.

Grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously,.

I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.

# The Power of Habit (Charles Duhigg)

Delicate folds of tissue where our thoughts, dreams—and according to some, souls—reside.

Deeper inside the brain and closer to the brain stem—where the brain meets the spinal column—are older, more primitive structures. They control our automatic behaviors, such as breathing and swallowing, or the startle response we feel when someone leaps out from behind a bush. Toward the center of the skull is a golf ball–sized lump of tissue that is similar to what you might find inside the head of a fish, reptile, or mammal.1.12 This is the basal ganglia, an oval of cells that, for years, scientists didn’t understand very well, except for suspicions that it played a role in diseases such as Parkinson’s.1.13, 1.14.

The basal ganglia was central to recalling patterns and acting on them. The basal ganglia, in other words, stored habits even while the rest of the brain went to sleep.

Take the act of backing your car out of the driveway. When you first learned to drive, the driveway required a major dose of concentration, and for good reason: It involves opening the garage, unlocking the car door, adjusting the seat, inserting the key in the ignition, turning it clockwise, moving the rearview and side mirrors and checking for obstacles, putting your foot on the brake, moving the gearshift into reverse, removing your foot from the brake, mentally estimating the distance between the garage and the street while keeping the wheels aligned and monitoring for oncoming traffic, calculating how reflected images in the mirrors translate into actual distances between the bumper, the garbage cans, and the hedges, all while applying slight pressure to the gas pedal and brake, and, most likely, telling your passenger to please stop fiddling with the radio. Nowadays, however, you do all of that every time you pull onto the street with hardly any thought. The routine occurs by habit.

Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.

Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.

This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future:.

Over time, this loop—cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward—becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges.

When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically.

And once someone creates a new pattern, studies have demonstrated, going for a jog or ignoring the doughnuts becomes as automatic as any other habit.

Habits are often as much a curse as a benefit.

Monkeys can memorize all the “correct” items after eight to ten days.

Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can emerge outside our consciousness, or can be deliberately designed. They often occur without our permission, but can be reshaped by fiddling with their parts. They shape our lives far more than we realize—they are so strong, in fact, that they cause our brains to cling to them at the exclusion of all else, including common sense.

Studies indicate that families usually don’t intend to eat fast food on a regular basis. What happens is that a once a month pattern slowly becomes once a week, and then twice a week—as the cues and rewards create a habit—until the kids are consuming an unhealthy amount of hamburgers and fries.

The brain has this amazing ability to find happiness even when the memories of it are gone.

Spent a long time talking to him,” she said. “I told him that I loved him, and about our kids and what a good life we had. I pointed to the pictures and talked about how much he was adored. We were married for fifty-seven years, and forty-two of those were a real, normal marriage. Sometimes it was hard, because I wanted my old husband back so much. But at least I knew he was happy.”.

“He told me once, pretty soon after we got married, that he wanted to do something important with his life, something that mattered. And he did. He just never remembered any of it.”.

Convinced Americans to buy Schlitz beer by boasting that the company cleaned their bottles “with live steam,” while neglecting to mention that every other company used the exact same method. He had seduced millions of women into purchasing Palmolive soap by proclaiming that Cleopatra had washed with it, despite the sputtering protests of outraged historians. He had made Puffed Wheat famous by saying that it was “shot from guns” until the grains puffed “to eight times normal size.” He had turned dozens of previously unknown products—Quaker Oats, Goodyear tires, the Bissell carpet sweeper, Van Camp’s pork and beans—into household names. And in the process, he had made himself so rich that his best-selling autobiography, My Life in Advertising, devoted long passages to the difficulties of spending so much money.

Within five years of that partnership, Hopkins turned Pepsodent into one of the best-known products on earth and, in the process, helped create a toothbrushing habit that moved across America with startling speed. Soon, everyone from Shirley Temple to Clark Gable was bragging about their “Pepsodent smile.”2.4.

A decade after the first Pepsodent campaign, pollsters found that toothbrushing had become a ritual for more than half the American population.2.6.

Hopkins had helped establish toothbrushing as a daily activity.

Claude C. Hopkins.

In focusing on tooth film, Hopkins was ignoring the fact that this same film has always covered people’s teeth and hadn’t seemed to bother anyone. The film is a naturally occurring membrane that builds up on teeth regardless of what you eat or how often you brush.2.7 People had never paid much attention to it, and there was little reason why they should: You can get rid of the film by eating an apple, running your finger over your teeth, brushing, or vigorously swirling liquid around your mouth. Toothpaste didn’t do anything to help remove the film. In fact, one of the leading dental researchers of the time said that all toothpastes—particularly Pepsodent—were worthless.2.8.

Before Pepsodent appeared, only 7 percent of Americans had a tube of toothpaste in their medicine chests.

Scents are strange; even the strongest fade with constant exposure.

This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually.

This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence.

When a smoker sees a cue—say, a pack of Marlboros—her brain starts anticipating a hit of nicotine. Just the sight of cigarettes is enough for the brain to crave a nicotine rush. If it doesn’t arrive, the craving grows until the smoker reaches, unthinkingly, for a Marlboro.

Or take email. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the momentary distraction that opening an email provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until a meeting is filled with antsy executives checking their buzzing BlackBerrys under the table, even if they know it’s probably only their latest fantasy football results. (On the other hand, if someone disables the buzzing—and, thus, removes the cue—people can work for hours without thinking to check their in-boxes.).

In one group, 92 percent of people said they habitually exercised because it made them “feel good”—they grew to expect and crave the endorphins and other neurochemicals a workout provided. In another group, 67 percent of people said that working out gave them a sense of “accomplishment”—they had come to crave a regular sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that self-reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit.

If you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last.

Reward—craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment—will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.2.29.

“I guess I should be thankful,” he said, “because the same process has let me create good habits. I work hard because I expect pride from a discovery. I exercise because I expect feeling good afterward. I just wish I could pick and choose better.”.

After Pepsodent started dominating the marketplace, researchers at competing companies scrambled to figure out why. What they found was that customers said that if they forgot to use Pepsodent, they realized their mistake because they missed that cool, tingling sensation in their mouths. They expected—they craved—that slight irritation. If it wasn’t there, their mouths didn’t feel clean.

Claude Hopkins wasn’t selling beautiful teeth. He was selling a sensation. Once people craved that cool tingling—once they equated it with cleanliness—brushing became a habit.

They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession.

Understanding the science of cravings is revolutionary.

“Foaming is a huge reward,” said Sinclair, the brand manager. “Shampoo doesn’t have to foam, but we add foaming chemicals because people expect it each time they wash their hair. Same thing with laundry detergent. And toothpaste—now every company adds sodium laureth sulfate to make toothpaste foam more. There’s no cleaning benefit, but people feel better when there’s a bunch of suds around their mouth. Once the customer starts.

“Champions don’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would explain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team.

“Champions don’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would explain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”.

Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.

You Can’t Extinguish a Bad Habit, You Can Only Change It.

“Realize you are licked, admit it, and get willing to turn your life over to God.”.

But to change an old habit, you must address an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine.

Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release.

Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts.

Hedonistic.

A pattern emerged. Alcoholics who practiced the techniques of habit replacement, the data indicated, could often stay sober until there was a stressful event in their lives—at which point, a certain number started drinking again, no matter how many new routines they had embraced. However, those alcoholics who believed, like John in Brooklyn, that some higher power had entered their lives were more likely to make it through the stressful periods with their sobriety intact. It wasn’t God that mattered, the researchers figured out. It was belief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. “I wouldn’t have said this a year ago—that’s how fast our understanding is changing,” said Tonigan, the University of New Mexico researcher, “but belief seems critical. You don’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get better.

“Some men like hugging each other,” another player told me. “I don’t. I haven’t hugged my sons in a decade. But after Coach came back, I walked over and I hugged him as long as I could, because I wanted him to know that I was there for him.”.

Group. If you want to quit smoking, figure out a different routine that will satisfy the cravings filled by cigarettes.

If you want to quit smoking, figure out a different routine that will satisfy the cravings filled by cigarettes.

If you want to lose weight, study your habits to determine why you really leave your desk for a snack each day, and then find someone else to take a walk with you, to gossip with at their desk rather than in the cafeteria, a group that tracks weight-loss goals together, or someone who also wants to keep a stock of apples, rather than chips, nearby.

If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.

Alcoholics can stop drinking. Smokers can quit puffing. Perennial losers can become champions.

By that definition, some researchers note, it is difficult to determine why spending fifty dollars a week on cocaine is bad, but fifty dollars a week on coffee is okay. Someone who craves a latte every afternoon may seem clinically addicted to an observer who thinks five dollars for coffee demonstrates an “impairment in behavioral control.” Is someone who would prefer running to having breakfast with his kids addicted to exercise?.

O’Neill believed that some habits have the power to start a chain reaction, changing other habits as they move through an organization. Some habits, in other words, matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives. These are “keystone habits,” and they can influence how people work, eat, play, live, spend, and communicate. Keystone habits start a process that, over time, transforms everything.

“Individuals have habits; groups have routines,”.

Rules that unions had spent decades opposing—such as measuring the productivity of individual workers—were suddenly embraced, because such measurements helped everyone figure out when part of the manufacturing process was getting out of whack, posing a safety risk.

Policies that managers had long resisted—such as giving workers autonomy to shut down a production line when the pace became overwhelming—were now welcomed, because that was the best way to stop injuries before they occurred. The company shifted so much that some employees found safety habits spilling into other parts of their lives.

When people start habitually exercising, even as infrequently as once a week, they start changing other, unrelated patterns in their lives, often unknowingly. Typically, people who exercise start eating better and becoming more productive at work. They smoke less and show more patience with colleagues and family. They use their credit cards less frequently and say they feel less stressed. It’s not completely clear why. But for many people, exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change. “Exercise spills over,” said James Prochaska, a University of Rhode Island researcher. “There’s something about it that makes other good habits easier.”.

Small wins are exactly what they sound like, and are part of how keystone habits create widespread changes.

Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.4.15 For example, when gay rights organizations.

“If you were to ask Michael what’s going on in his head before competition, he would say he’s not really thinking about anything. He’s just following the program. But that’s not right. It’s more like his habits have taken over. When the race arrives, he’s more than halfway through his plan and he’s been victorious at every step. All the stretches went like he planned. The warm-up laps were just like he visualized.

His headphones are playing exactly what he expected. The actual race is just another step in a pattern that started earlier that day and has been nothing but victories. Winning is a natural extension.”.

(“I love Paul O’Neill, but you could not pay me enough to work for him again,” one official told me. “The man has never encountered an answer he can’t turn into another twenty hours of work.”).

Within Goldman Sachs, a keystone habit of risk assessment undergirds every decision.

“When I was made a plant manager,” said Jeff Shockey, the Alcoa executive, “the first day I pulled into the parking lot I saw all these parking spaces near the front doors with people’s titles on them. The head guy for this or that. People who were important got the best parking spots. The first thing I did was tell a maintenance manager to paint over all the titles. I wanted whoever got to work earliest to get the best spot. Everyone understood the message: Every person matters. It was an extension of what Paul was doing around worker safety. It electrified the plant. Pretty soon, everyone was getting to work earlier each day.”.

“Your apron is a shield,” he told her. “Nothing anyone says will ever hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.”.

“Highly self-disciplined adolescents outperformed their more impulsive peers on every academic-performance variable,”.

“Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren’t working hard—but that’s because they’ve made it automatic,” Angela.

There was one famous experiment, conducted in the 1960s, in which scientists at Stanford had tested the willpower of a group of four-year-olds. The kids were brought into a room and presented with a selection of treats, including marshmallows. They were offered a deal: They could eat one marshmallow right away, or, if they waited a few minutes, they could have two marshmallows. Then the researcher left the room. Some kids gave in to temptation and ate the marshmallow as soon as the adult left. About 30 percent managed to ignore their urges, and doubled their treats when the researcher came back fifteen minutes later. Scientists, who were watching everything from behind a two-way mirror, kept careful track of which kids had enough self-control to earn the second marshmallow.

Years later, they tracked down many of the study’s participants. By now, they were in high school. The researchers asked about their grades and SAT scores, ability to maintain friendships, and their capacity to “cope with important problems.” They discovered that the four-year-olds who could delay gratification the longest ended up with the best grades and with SAT scores 210 points higher, on average, than everyone else. They were more popular and did fewer drugs. If you knew how to avoid the temptation of a marshmallow as a preschooler, it seemed, you also knew how to get yourself to class on time and finish your homework once you got older, as well as how to make friends and resist peer pressure. It was as if the marshmallow-ignoring kids had self-regulatory skills.

The patients who had written plans in their booklets had started walking almost twice as fast as the ones who had not. They had started getting in and out of their chairs, unassisted, almost three times as fast. They were putting on their shoes, doing the laundry, and making themselves meals quicker than the patients who hadn’t scribbled out goals ahead of time.

“This workbook is for you to imagine unpleasant situations, and write out a plan for responding,” the manager said. “One of the systems we use is called the LATTE method. We Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them, and then Explain why the problem occurred.5.19.

For instance, at Deloitte Consulting, the largest tax and financial services company in the world, employees are trained in a curriculum named “Moments That Matter,” which focuses on dealing with inflection points such as when a client complains about fees, when a colleague is fired, or when a Deloitte consultant has made a mistake.

For each of those moments, there are preprogrammed routines—Get Curious, Say What No One Else Will, Apply the 5/5/5 Rule—that guide employees in how they should respond. At.

“I’ve been really lucky,” he said. “And I really, genuinely believe that if you tell people that they have what it takes to succeed, they’ll prove you right.”.

Fatigued by the brusque instructions. When Muraven started exploring why students who had been treated kindly had more willpower he found that the key difference was the sense of control they had over their experience.

They think they are doing it for personal reasons—if they feel like it’s a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else—it’s much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they’re just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster. In both cases, people ignored the cookies. But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.”.

And almost always, they are the products of thoughtlessness, of leaders who avoid thinking about the culture and so let it develop without guidance.

For instance, it might seem like the chief executive of a clothing company made the decision last year to feature a red cardigan on the catalog’s cover by carefully reviewing sales and marketing data. But, in fact, what really happened was that his vice president constantly trolls websites devoted to Japanese fashion trends (where red was hip last spring), and the firm’s marketers routinely ask their friends which colors are “in,” and the company’s executives, back from their annual trip to the Paris runway shows, reported hearing that designers at rival firms were using new magenta pigments. All these small inputs, the result of uncoordinated patterns among executives gossiping about competitors and talking to their friends, got mixed into the company’s more formal research and development routines until a consensus emerged: Red will be popular this year. No one made a solitary, deliberate decision. Rather, dozens of habits, processes, and behaviors converged until it seemed like red was the inevitable choice.

Companies aren’t families. They’re battlefields in a civil war. Yet.

So at most companies, an unspoken compact emerges: It’s okay to be ambitious, but if you play too rough, your peers will unite against you. On the other hand, if you focus on boosting your own department, rather than undermining your rival, you’ll probably get taken care of over time.6.23.

To survive, every fashion designer has to possess some basic skills: creativity and a flair for haute couture as a start. But that’s not enough to succeed.6.25 What makes the difference between success or failure are a designer’s routines—whether they have a system for getting Italian broadcloth before wholesalers’ stocks sell out, a process for finding the best zipper and button seamstresses, a routine for shipping a dress to a store in ten days, rather than three weeks. Fashion is such a complicated business that, without the right processes, a new company will get bogged down with logistics, and once that happens, creativity ceases to matter.

That’s a good start. Unfortunately, it isn’t enough. Creating successful organizations isn’t just a matter of balancing authority. For an organization to work, leaders must cultivate habits that both create a real and balanced peace and, paradoxically, make it absolutely clear who’s in charge.

Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it’s worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.

All those leaders seized the possibilities created by a crisis. During turmoil, organizational habits become malleable enough to both assign responsibility and create a more equitable balance of power. Crises are so valuable, in fact, that sometimes it’s worth stirring up a sense of looming catastrophe rather than letting it die down.

In fact, crises are such valuable opportunities that a wise leader often prolongs a sense of emergency on purpose.

New parents are so valuable that major retailers will do almost anything to find them, including going inside maternity wards, even if their products have nothing to do with infants. One New York hospital, for instance, provides every new mother with a gift bag containing samples of hair gel, face wash, shaving cream, an energy bar, shampoo, and a soft-cotton T-shirt. Inside are coupons for an online photo service, hand soap, and a local gym. There are also samples of diapers and baby lotions, but they’re lost among the nonbaby supplies.

That certainty wasn’t based solely on intuition. At the time, the record business was undergoing a transformation similar to the data-driven shifts occurring at Target and elsewhere. Just as retailers were using computer algorithms to forecast shoppers’ habits, music and radio executives were using computer programs to forecast listeners’ habits. A company named Polyphonic HMI—a collection of artificial intelligence experts and statisticians based in Spain—had created a program called Hit Song Science that analyzed the mathematical characteristics of a tune and predicted its popularity. By comparing the tempo, pitch, melody, chord progression, and other factors of a particular song against the thousands of hits stored in Polyphonic HMI’s database, Hit Song Science could deliver a score that forecasted if a tune was likely to succeed.7.14.

“People listen to Top 40 because they want to hear their favorite songs or songs that sound just like their favorite songs. When something different comes on, they’re offended. They don’t want anything unfamiliar.”.

When stations played “Breathe” by Blu Cantrell during the summer of 2003, almost no one changed the dial. The song is an eminently forgettable, beat-driven tune that DJs found so bland that most of them only played it reluctantly, they told music publications. But for some reason, whenever it came on the radio, people.

Parks would become a hero, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a shining example of how a single act of defiance can change the world.

Social habits are what fill streets with protesters who may not know one another, who might be marching for different reasons, but who are all moving in the same direction.

A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances. It grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods and clans together. And it endures because a movement’s leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownership.

“Rosa Parks was one of those rare people of whom everyone agreed that she gave more than she got,”.

Peer pressure—and the social habits that encourage people to conform to group expectations—is difficult to describe, because it often differs in form and expression from person to person.

“Don’t get your weapons. He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.”.

“We must love our white brothers, no matter what they do to us,” King said. “We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: ‘Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use you.’ ”.

King gave people a new lens. This wasn’t a war, he said. It was an embrace.

This was not just about equality on buses, King said; it was part of God’s plan, the same destiny that had ended British colonialism in India and slavery in the United States, and that had caused Christ to die on the cross so that he could take away our sins. It was the newest stage in a movement that had started centuries earlier. And as such, it required new responses, different strategies and behaviors. It needed participants to offer the other cheek. People could show their allegiance by adopting the new habits King was evangelizing about.

“We must meet hate with love,” King told the crowd the night of the bombing. “If I am stopped, our work will not stop. For what we are doing is right. What we are doing is just. And God is with us.”.

Protecting people from their bad habits—in fact, defining which habits should be considered “bad” in the first place—is a prerogative lawmakers have eagerly seized.

As I’ve tried to demonstrate throughout this book, habits—even once they are rooted in our minds—aren’t destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can.

Hundreds of habits influence our days—they guide how we get dressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business, and whether we exercise or have a beer after work. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Some are simple and others are complex, drawing upon emotional triggers and offering subtle neurochemical prizes. But every habit, no matter its complexity, is malleable. The most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager.

Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.

“All our life,” William James told us in the prologue, “so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits—practical, emotional, and intellectual—systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us.

“All our life,” William James told us in the prologue, “so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits—practical, emotional, and intellectual—systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”.

Later, he would famously write that the will to believe is the most important ingredient in creating belief in change. And that one of the most important methods for creating that belief was habits. Habits, he noted, are what allow us to “do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all.” Once we choose who we want to be, people grow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.” If you believe you can change—if you make it a habit—the change becomes real. This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be. Once that choice occurs—and becomes automatic—it’s not only real, it starts to seem inevitable, the thing, as James wrote, that bears “us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”.

“There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says ‘Morning, boys. How’s the water?’ ” the writer David Foster Wallace told a class of graduating college students in 2005. “And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes ‘What the hell is water?’ ”.

The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day—and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.

Put another way, a habit is a formula our brain automatically follows: When I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE in order to get a REWARD.

I have been undeservedly lucky throughout my life to work with people who are more talented than I am, and to get to steal their wisdom and gracefulness and pass it off as my own.


# Indian Summer_ The Secret History of the - Tunzelmann, Alex Von

Society began to aspire.

The year was 1577, and the Mogul emperors were in the process of uniting India. The domain spread twelve hundred miles along the Tropic of Cancer, from the eerie white salt flats of the Rann of Kutch on the shores of the Arabian Sea, to the verdant delta of the holy river Ganges in Bengal; and from the snowy crags of Kabul to the lush teak forests of the Vindhyan foothills. The 100 million people who lived under its aegis were cosmopolitan and affluent. In 1577, the average Indian.

Since the death of the indigenous emperor Asoka in 232 B.C., large parts of the subcontinent had been conquered.

By the 1670s, the company could mint its own coin, maintain its own army, wage war, make peace, acquire new territories and impose its own civil and criminal law—and all without any accountability, save to its shareholders.

This was pure capitalism, unleashed for the first time in history.

The British government was beginning to agree, and over the following decades regulation began to creep in, act by act. Eventually, in 1834, the parliament in London decided that an empire based on trade was in poor taste, and drew up a new charter. The East India Company was still to govern, but no more to trade. Presenting the scheme to parliament, Thomas Babington Macaulay freely admitted that licensing out British sovereignty to a private company was inappropriate. “It is the strangest of all governments,” he said, “but it is designed for the strangest of all empires.” 8 But the British Crown could not bring its beast to heel. That would.

Take a revolt by the Indians themselves.

Battle of Plassey in 1757.

Once inside, it had been able to suck the wealth and riches out of India and impose its own regime—all by the grace of the Indian rulers. 11 “The English have not taken India,” wrote Mohandas Gandhi succinctly in 1908; “we have given it to them.” 12.

Meanwhile, the British retained the support of the Sikhs of the Punjab, the Pathans of the North-West Frontier, the Gurkhas of Nepal, and the armies of Bombay and Madras. Neither Calcutta nor Simla, the two seats of the company’s administration, was attacked. 18 Almost all the princes stayed.

Loyal to the British. The problem that had dogged the subcontinent since the death of Asoka, and would continue to dog it until 1947, was becoming clear.

A country not only divided between Mohammedan and Hindu, but between tribe and tribe, between caste and caste; a society whose framework was based on a sort of equilibrium, resulting from a general repulsion and constitutional exclusiveness between all its members. Such a country and such a society, were they not the predestined prey of conquest?” 19.

We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligation of duties which bind us to all our other subjects. In their prosperity will be our strength; in their contentment our security; and in their gratitude our best reward.” 24.

All Gandhi’s most famous tactics—passive resistance, civil disobedience, logical argument, nonviolence in the face of violence, emotional blackmail—had come from Kasturbai’s influence.

Being a saint, and it is perhaps even less so to live with one.

It is not easy being a saint, and it is perhaps even less so to live with one.

British imperialism would be compelled to evacuate Great Britain itself before it would willingly evacuate India,” 3 sentiments with which the future king-emperor and his retinue would doubtless have agreed. Perhaps they did not realize how close the imperial trust was to being liquidated— without their consent.

The Indian states would have many more chances to impress the disoriented Prince of Wales as he traveled on through Udaipur to the extraordinary blue-painted town of Jodhpur.

By the time of the Prince of Wales’s tour, Jawahar had been confirmed as a rising star of the freedom movement, and one more radical than his august father. Motilal had been opposed to satyagraha in the first instance and argued that the sending of a few individuals to prison would make little difference. In particular, he was unhappy with the thought of Jawahar ending up there. A doting father does not send his only.

Beloved son to Harrow and Cambridge with the expectation that he will end up in a jailhouse. Yet Jawahar was determined to pursue satyagraha. Though even Gandhi advised him to do nothing that would upset Motilal, he could not be dissuaded. Father and son argued for several days. Jawahar pointedly began to eat bread and milk in the evenings from a steel bowl, amid the rest of the family’s crystal and Dresden china. Before one dinner he was fiddling with a piece of twine from a parcel and commented, “I wonder what it feels like to have a noose round one’s neck?” Swarup Rani nearly fainted; Motilal walked out and slammed the door. “Has this family no sense of humour left?”.

Asked Jawahar, crossly. 36 That night, Motilal secretly tried sleeping on the floor, wanting to understand the hardship his son would suffer in prison. 37.

He quoted his greatgrandmother Queen Victoria’s proclamation of 1858 about the Indians: “In their prosperity will be our strength; in their contentment our security; and in their gratitude our best reward.

His reason was a single incident of mob violence that occurred in the small town of Chauri Chaura in the United Provinces, the day after the Prince of Wales had been photographed with the Begum of Bhopal.

It is better to be charged with cowardice and weakness than to be guilty of denial of our oath and to sin against God.”.

The nonviolent method was not, and could not be, a religion or an unchallengeable creed or dogma. It could only be a policy and a method promising certain results, and by those results it would have to be finally judged. Individuals might make of it a religion or incontrovertible creed. But no political organisation, so long as it remained political, could do so.” 67.

Those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means.

Nehru quickly realized that the Mahatma’s argument provided the British with the permanent means to defeat him.

He wrote Edwina a piteous letter: “I wish I knew how to flirt with other women, and especially with my wife. I wish I’d sown more wild oats in my youth, and could excite more than I fear I do. I wish I wasn’t in the Navy and had to drag you out to Malta. I wish I had an equal share of the money so that I could give you far handsomer presents than I can really at present honestly manage. In other words, I’d like to feel that I was really worthy of your love.” 16.

As their marriage floundered, the Mountbattens’ separate pursuits grew ever more important. While Edwina partied, Dickie invented things. He became obsessed with time-saving devices. He equipped himself with elasticized shoes, had his suspenders stitched permanently to his trousers and wore a buttonless waistcoat that could.

Be pulled on over his head like a sweater. His valet even reported that Dickie invented a “Simplex” shirt with built-in Y-fronts, “that he could slide into like a stretch suit.” Edwina had started to find her husband tiresome and unattractive. 32 But her extramarital social life was not making her happy, either.

Meanwhile, the relationship between Gandhi and the younger Nehru was intense, fraught and semipaternal. The two men had wildly different political and philosophical ideas but a peculiarly potent sympathy with each other, both emotional and practical.

People who do not know Gandhiji personally and have only read his writings are apt to think that he is a priestly type, extremely puritanical, long-faced, Calvinistic, and a kill-joy,” Nehru wrote. “He is the very opposite … . His smile is delightful, his laughter infectious, and he radiates lightheartedness. There is something childlike about him which is full of charm.” 44.

Once again, by lack of elementary tact, the British did for us what we could not seem to do ourselves,” wrote Betty, wryly; “they unified India.” 60 The protests would give Jawaharlal Nehru his first experience of violence at the hands of the state.

In peacetime, the raj never took more than 7 percent of India’s income.

Indian police guards, commanded by a handful of British officers, ran forward to meet the first column of marchers and struck at them brutally with their steel-tipped lathis. “Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows,” Miller wrote. 9 The air filled with the grisly thud of steel against undefended skull. The first line fell in pools of their own blood, many struck unconscious. The rest marched on until they, too, were beaten down. Then a second column formed, and the same thing happened again.

Whether Gandhi had been very tiresome, to which he replied sharply, “Some people found Our Lord very tiresome.”.

From 15 February to 5 March, Irwin and Gandhi prepared a pact. Congress would discontinue its campaign of civil disobedience, lift the boycott on British goods and send a delegate to the second Round Table Conference. In return, political prisoners would be freed, the.

Swadeshi campaign would be approved and those Indians who lived near the sea would be allowed to make salt unhindered.

The pact reserved British control over defense, foreign policy, finance and the position of minorities. It did not challenge the extortionate tax rates on peasants; salt could be made but not sold; and there would be no investigation into allegations of police brutality.

Chaplin arrived first and went straight to the upstairs front room, where he waited and tried to think of things to say to the Mahatma.

Now came that uneasy, terrifying moment,” Chaplin remembered, “when I should say something astutely intelligent upon a subject I knew little about.” 19 Bravely, he ventured to declare himself sympathetic to India’s freedom struggle and asked Gandhi about his opposition to machinery. Gandhi gave his usual answer, about the real meaning of independence being the shedding of unnecessary things, while the photographers snapped away, flashbulbs popping.

I must not be drawn into political argument in Your Majesty’s Palace after receiving Your Majesty’s hospitality.

For all his fame, the Mahatma was one man and therefore appeared to be in a minority. B. R. Ambedkar for the Untouchables, Tara Singh for the Sikhs and the Aga Khan and Mohammad Ali Jinnah for the Muslims all demanded separate concessions for their communities—and were more than able to shout Gandhi down.

When Gandhi eventually arrived back at Bombay, it was to a chorus of boos and the waving of black flags by two thousand Untouchable protesters, who viewed his insistence that they should not be given a separate electorate from caste-Hindus as an act of repression. 26.

To a considerable extent the delay may be attributed to the actions of three men: Winston Churchill, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Mohandas Gandhi. 27.

Our rule in India is as it were a sheet of oil spread out over and keeping free from storms a vast and profound ocean of humanity.

The British, in their role as paternalistic rulers, had a moral duty to protect them. If the British left, it would be a dereliction of that duty; therefore the British could not leave India. The existence of the Muslim League served to strengthen this argument. Meanwhile, it suited the Muslim League to have friends in the British establishment.

Jinnah was a successful barrister,.

Born in Karachi and called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn. Tall and slender, he hardly ate, and smoked fifty Craven A cigarettes a day. 31.

Undoubtedly one of the best dressed men in the British Empire.

Jinnah had begun his political career in Congress. He made himself a figurehead for Hindu-Muslim unity and was acclaimed as such by Hindu Congress luminaries. He had joined the Muslim League in 1913, confident that he could act as a bridge between the political parties. But it was the emergence of Gandhi as the spiritual leader of Congress in 1920 that began to push Jinnah out.

I part company with the Congress and Gandhi. I do not believe in working up mob hysteria. Politics is a gentleman’s game.

His Islam was liberal, moderate and tolerant. It was said that he could recite none of the Koran, rarely went to a mosque and spoke little Urdu.

Much has been made of his reluctance to don Muslim outfits, his fondness for whiskey and his rumored willingness to eat ham sandwiches. 36.

Much has been made of his reluctance to don Muslim outfits, his fondness for whiskey and his rumored willingness to eat ham sandwiches. 36 In fact, he never pretended to be anything other than a progressive Muslim, influenced by the intellectual and economic aspects of European culture as well as by the teachings of Muhammad.

Muslim League suffered from no shortage of good Muslims. What it had lacked was a good politician. And Jinnah was without question one of the most brilliant politicians of his day.

Gandhi’s need for spotless moral perfection hamstrung his party’s progress. His principal object was to make the Indian people worthy of freedom in the eyes of God. The object of actually achieving freedom from the British was secondary.

Gandhi’s most influential work, Hind swaraj, published in 1908, set out very clearly his point of view: that European civilization was corrupt, atheist and destructive, but that merely driving the British out of India would not serve to make India free. To be free, Indians needed to relinquish violence, material possessions,.

Machinery, railways, lawyers, doctors, formal education, the English language, discord between Hindu and Muslim, alcohol and sex.

It is impossible to assess how the Indian nationalist struggle might have proceeded without Gandhi, but there are.

Ample grounds for thinking that a more earthly campaign led by a united Congress, perhaps under the joint leadership of Motilal Nehru and Mohammad Ali Jinnah, could have brought dominion status to India in the 1920s. 44.

Gandhi’s spiritual style of leadership was a source of inspiration to millions, but, politically speaking, it was erratic.

Gandhi’s spiritual style of leadership was a source of inspiration to millions, but, politically speaking, it was erratic. Within Congress, too, it created divisions. Congress was not a church, and Gandhi’s mystical judgments were often difficult even for his closest followers to accept.

Nehru saw social and economic hardship as a cause of suffering, and therefore wanted to end it; Gandhi saw hardship as noble and righteous, and therefore wanted to spread the blessings of poverty and humility to all people.

It was not division he wanted, but respect for the Untouchables within Hinduism.

Ambedkar was outraged that Gandhi was fasting against the granting of separate electorates to Untouchables, while apparently not objecting to the same concession being given to Muslims or Sikhs. 49.

Tagore argued caustically that this supposedly “divine” justice, if such it was, constituted the least just form of punishment imaginable. 57.

Vacancy in his life. Gandhi still had four sons; but in 1936, there was a very public scandal involving his eldest. Harilal declared that he had converted to Islam, began calling himself Abdullah Gandhi and attacked his father in print.

At around this time, Gandhi suffered from the first of a series of nervous breakdowns. He left Kasturba and his followers and moved into a oneroom hut in central India, far from railways or post offices, and among a population mostly consisting of Untouchables. 59 As after Chauri Chaura, he withdrew from the political scene and focused on spiritual leadership. His hope for the future now was Jawaharlal Nehru.

What is this about your giving an assurance to Government? Do not give it!” 61 Back he went to prison, full of admiration. But their new closeness was not to last long. A few months later, at the beginning of 1935, Jawahar was allowed to visit Kamala for another couple of days—but found that she had grown distant. “Somehow things went wrong,” he wrote in his diary. “I felt there was a psychological change. She seemed reserved.”.

To much raising of eyebrows from those who had observed his devotion to Kamala, Feroze first proposed to Indira three years later. She refused, and he kept proposing until 1937, when she finally accepted on the steps of Sacré- Coeur in Paris.

She refused, and he kept proposing until 1937, when she finally accepted on the steps of Sacré- Coeur in Paris. Jawahar was among the disapprovers and asked her to return from Europe to Allahabad to think it over.

She refused to speak to him until he let her return to Feroze. 72 After a five-year wait for her to finish her education at Oxford, and many more fights with her father, she would marry Feroze in a Hindu ceremony.

Ten days later, for the first time in history, a king voluntarily abdicated the British throne.

The British Indian civil servant Penderel Moon called Congress’s rejection of the league at this point “a fatal error—the prime cause of the creation of Pakistan.” 93.

But, behind the celebrating, Muslim parties all over India were taken aback at Congress’s rejection of League participation, which, they feared, was a sign of the Hindu arrogance that Jinnah had long been warning them about.

“It went to my head, intoxicated me a little, and gave me confidence and strength. I became (I imagine so, for it is a difficult task to look at oneself from outside) just a little bit autocratic in my ways, just a shade dictatorial.” 101.

This powerful vilification was published under the pseudonym “Chanakya,” after an ancient political philosopher, and caused great outrage among Nehru’s loyal followers. What they did not realize was that “Chanakya” was actually Jawaharlal Nehru himself.

But the opposition to Nehru in Congress consisted of more than himself.

Bose was carried away with his own remarkable triumph over the Mahatma. He started calling himself “Netaji” (Dear Leader) in a deliberate imitation of Adolf Hitler’s title, “Führer.

February 1939, twelve members of the Congress Working Committee resigned, and Bose was left politically adrift. He was effectively beaten into resignation by May.

He did not believe that women should resist rape, but preferred that they should “defeat” their assailants by remaining passive and silent.

Gandhi advised the Jews in Germany to offer passive resistance to the Nazi regime—and to give up their own lives as sacrifices.

He would salve his self respect and leave an example which, if it became infectious, would save the whole of Jewry and leave a rich heritage to mankind besides.”.

Gandhi compounded this error of judgment by offering praise to Hitler. “I do not consider Herr Hitler to be as bad as he is depicted,” he wrote in May 1940. “He is showing an ability that is amazing and he seems to be gaining his victories without much bloodshed.”.

He regretted that Hitler had employed war rather than nonviolence to achieve his aims, but nonetheless averred that the Germans of the future “will honour Herr Hitler as a genius, a brave man, a matchless organizer and much more.”.

The American journalist Louis Fischer brought up this subject with Gandhi in 1946. By that time, the concentration camps had been discovered, and the true, awful extent of the Holocaust revealed. It might have been expected that the benefit of hindsight would have tempered the old man’s views.

It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher’s knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs … . As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions.

“I shall fight them to the end and this is my policy. I shall also fight Mr. Subhas Bose and his party along with Japan if he comes to India.” 11.

In Which We Serve is one of the few films in which an actor playing a real-life character is less good-looking than the genuine article.

During the war years, Gandhi and Congress handed Jinnah a sixteenfold increase in his support. Quit India damaged the chances of a united India at least as much as any single act of the British administration ever had.

The contention that India should be given back to the Indians did not sit well with Churchill and the opposition, but they had little room for maneuver.

“We will have,” Jinnah announced, “either a divided India or a destroyed India.”.

The aged Mahatma had been “testing” his vow of celibacy by sleeping at night in bed with a naked or partially clothed woman.

The two main political parties in India had no real will to reach agreement among themselves,” he wrote; “the situation might so develop as to result in Civil War in India, & there seemed to be little realization among Indian leaders of the risk that ordered govt. might collapse.” He concluded, “The Indian leaders have got to learn that the responsibility is theirs & that they must learn how to govern.

Loquacious.

Both begged Mountbatten not to let the British leave India at all.

But for Congress, there was no body in India which would not move Heaven and Earth to keep the British.

Vallabhbhai Patel of Congress, ominously nicknamed “the Iron Man,” was a forcefully Hindu-nationalist lawyer, clever and cool. He was impervious to Mountbatten’s famous charm, describing the new viceroy as “a toy for Jawaharlalji to play with—while we arrange the revolution.” 28.

Criticism always bites harder when it comes dressed up as praise.

Thus Jinnah, he said, was “one of the most extraordinary men in history” and a “financially successful though mediocre lawyer,” who avoided taking any action that might split his party, such as holding debates or answering questions. The assessment had the taint of sour grapes to it, but Mountbatten did not seem to notice. 29.

Women were prominent in Indian politics, a trend which Edwina Mountbatten, along with many Indian women, attributed to Gandhism. Nonviolence, passive resistance and boycotts were all tactics which could be practiced by women without breaking social conventions; and Nehru had insisted as early as 1937 that the Congress manifesto pledge to remove all social, economic and political discrimination against women. As a result, there were more powerful women in India’s Congress than there were in Britain’s Labour Party or in the United States’ Democratic Party at the time.

The Mahatma launched upon an unsuspecting Mountbatten his plan to quell the bubbling discontent between Hindu and Muslim. It was an extraordinary suggestion. Jinnah was to be made prime minister and could form a cabinet entirely composed of Muslims if he wished.

The Mahatma launched upon an unsuspecting Mountbatten his plan to quell the bubbling discontent between Hindu and Muslim. It was an extraordinary suggestion. Jinnah was to be made prime minister and could form a cabinet entirely composed of Muslims if he wished. Congress would agree to cooperate freely and sincerely. This would, Gandhi believed, satisfy the Muslims that the new India was not to be.

A “Hindustan,” and that their rights and freedoms would be represented.

That day was April Fool’s Day, but Gandhi’s scheme was not a joke. He intended that Jinnah should be offered a chance to form an exclusively Islamic cabinet, despite the fact that the Muslim population of India was only around 25 percent, with the majority Congress Party meekly serving beneath them, and apparently did not foresee any potential upset in the already inflamed Hindu and Sikh communities as a consequence of this.

He described the old man as “going round with ointment trying to heal one sore spot after another on the body of India, instead of diagnosing the cause of this eruption of sores and participating in the treatment of the body as a whole.”.

The rejection prompted his withdrawal from formal involvement in negotiations for the transfer of power, though he would continue to contribute from the sidelines. 45.

May began, and with it came the first crippling outbreak of the inevitable “Delhi belly,” which felled both Mountbatten and Ismay.

It became the official summer capital of India. Here.

Though once a flamboyant youth, Nehru had become a man of simpler tastes. Yet there were two pleasures he could never resist: the vitality of mountain scenery and the company of an interesting woman.

Thanks to the war: it owed Egypt £450 million, Ireland £250 million, Australia and New Zealand £200 million each, and further enormous sums to Argentina, Norway and Brazil. But the largest creditor of all, with £1,250 million owed, was India.

Dominion status had been seen as.

I find myself all alone,” said Gandhi. “Even the Sardar [Patel] and Jawaharlal think my reading of the situation is wrong and peace is sure to return if partition is agreed upon … the future of independence gained at this price is going to be dark.”.

He may be a saint but he seems also to be a disciple of Trotsky,”.

Judge then of my astonished delight on finding him enter the room with his finger to his lips to indicate that it was his day of silence.

The next morning, the leaders of all parties arrived back at the Viceroy’s House, tired and acquiescent. Mountbatten was prepared to listen to their many reservations in private but decided that none should be allowed to speak at the meeting in case they upset each other. And so, for the first time in history, no party raised an objection against a plan for independence.

But it is curious that we should regard as a hero the man who liquidates the Empire which other heroes such as Clive, Warren Hastings and Napier won for us.

Mountbatten had chosen 15 August “out of the blue,” he admitted; it was the second anniversary of VJ Day, but nothing more significant than that. 12.

Dickie had always striven to impress her with his achievements at work. Perhaps, if he could carry out the transfer of power swiftly and efficiently enough, he might still save his marriage.

It was known that the maharaja wanted Kashmir independent, a scheme unpalatable to Nehru, Gandhi and the British. The Mountbattens’ visit to Kashmir was not a raging success. At the opening banquet, Dickie accidentally set off a bell that had been installed under the table, which alerted the band to play “God Save the King.”.

Nehru himself was a Kashmiri by descent, and his detachment would repeatedly fail him when dealing with his ancestral state.

Nehru himself was a Kashmiri by descent, and his detachment would repeatedly fail him when dealing with his ancestral state. Nonetheless, there was another reason for his desperation to secure Kashmir. If the North-West Frontier Province went to Pakistan, India would lose the Hindu Kush mountains—its natural defense against attack from the north.

If both the NWFP and Kashmir went to Pakistan, there would be nothing but farmland between India and the Soviets, the Afghans, the Pakistanis and the Chinese. 31 The danger from the north was real and immediate, especially after 2 July, when Afghanistan revived its old claim to territory on the North-West Frontier, comprising most of the land between the Indus River and the border.

Mountbatten had repeatedly proclaimed his preference for a united India, creating fears in the Muslim League that a joint governor-generalship might favor the reabsorption of Pakistan, in line with Congress hopes. 51.

Jinnah’s, argued that a joint governorgeneralship under Mountbatten would have meant Pakistan “getting destroyed at inception.” By July, Jinnah had very strong reasons to suspect that Mountbatten was wrapped around Nehru’s finger. “Nehru in those days was having a roaring love affair with Lady Mountbatten,” added Bakhtiar, “said to be with the tacit approval of Mountbatten.” 52.

But four of the most important states—Hyderabad, Kashmir, Bhopal and Travancore— wanted to become independent nations.

Each of these states had its own unique set of difficulties. The Nizam of Hyderabad was the richest man in the world; he was a Muslim, and his people were mostly Hindus. His state was enormous, and both France and the United States were rumored to be ready to recognize it. 35 The Maharaja of.

Kashmir was a Hindu; his people were mostly Muslims. His state was even bigger than Hyderabad but more limited by its lack of trade routes and industrial potential. The Nawab of Bhopal was an able and ambitious Muslim prince, and one of Jinnah’s advisers; unfortunately for him, his state had a Hindu majority and was stuck right in the middle of India, over five hundred miles from the likely border with Pakistan. Uranium deposits had recently been discovered in Travancore, lending the situation there a greater international interest.

The Hindu Maharaja of Jodhpur, who had just turned twenty-four and had only succeeded to the throne in June, provided a dramatic moment. Jinnah had been courting him, with plans that Patel.

Feared would create “a dagger into the very heart of India,” a spur of Pakistan that would run down through Jodhpur into Bhopal. Mountbatten explained to the maharaja that he was legally entitled to join Pakistan, but reminded him of his Hindu majority. “Your Highness is free to stay out, if you like,” Patel added. “But if there is trouble in your State as a result of your decision, you will not get the slightest support from the Government of India.” 45 The maharaja was shaken by this clear threat. He turned up at the Viceroy’s House and was fobbed off with V. P. Menon while Mountbatten dealt with a Hyderabad delegation in Edwina’s study next door.

Apparently, Menon was not to the.

Maharaja’s satisfaction. He pulled out a pistol concealed behind the nib of a very large fountain pen and screamed that he would “shoot him down like a dog if he betrayed the starving people of Jodhpur.” Menon talked him down, and the maharaja eventually put the gun away —later making a present of it to Mountbatten, who “gave him hell” for the incident. 46.

Nehru had broken down and wept, explaining that Kashmir meant more to him at the moment than anything else.” 64.

Whatever may be said about Mountbatten’s tactics or the machinations of Patel, their.

Achievement remains remarkable. Between them, and in less than a year, it may be argued that these two men achieved a larger India, more closely integrated, than had ninety years of the British raj, 180 years of the Mogul Empire, or 130 years of Asoka and the Maurya rulers.

A Sunni Muslim from the Punjab might have more in common with a Sikh than he did with a Shia Muslim from Bengal; a Shia might regard a Sufi Muslim as a heretic; a Sufi might get on better with a Brahmin Hindu than with a Wahhabi Muslim; a Brahmin might feel more at ease with a European than he would with another Hindu who was an outcaste.

Whether the British caused division by carving up politics on the basis of religion, or whether they were simply responding to a trend in Indian society for Hindu nationalism and the beginnings of an Islamic resurgence, is an endlessly debatable question.

In 1947, its significance was that it provided the only useful land link between India and Kashmir. Farther east along the Indo-Kashmiri border, the Himalayas rose so high as to prohibit a readily navigable route. Mountbatten has been accused of interfering with the decision on Gurdaspur, and certainly its fate had worried Nehru. 17 Most of it did eventually go to India, but there is good reason to think it would have done so anyway.

The governor, Sir Frederick Burrows, had predicted that an independent East Bengal without Calcutta would become a “rural slum.” It was felt among Muslims that partition of Bengal was a way of sabotaging East Pakistan. Mountbatten agreed. During the meeting, he made it clear several times that the whole point of the current policy was to allow Pakistan “to fail on its demerits.” If the plan presented to Jinnah was awful enough, the British thought, he could be made to reconsider the whole idea of Pakistan. 26.

On 26 April, Mountbatten asked.

On 26 April, Mountbatten asked Jinnah how he would feel if Bengal, as a whole, became independent rather than joining Pakistan. Jinnah replied unhesitatingly: “I should be delighted. What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had much better remain united and independent; I am sure that they would remain on friendly terms with us.” 27 Congress, on the other hand, was under no circumstance prepared to countenance a fully independent Bengal, and the Muslim League in East Bengal was under no circumstance prepared to join India.

What was created, then, in East Bengal, soon to be East Pakistan.

And afterward Bangladesh, was a nation deliberately designed to be incapable of supporting itself. At least one half of Pakistan was set up to fail.

Gandhi has announced his decision to spend the rest.

Of his life in Pakistan looking after the minorities,”.

This will infuriate Jinnah, but will be a great relief to Congress for, as I have said before, his influence is largely negative or even destructive.

He has lived to see his followers transgress his dearest doctrines; his countrymen have indulged in a bloody and inhuman fratricidal war; non-violence, khadi and many another of his principles have been swept away by the swift current of politics. Disillusioned and disappointed, he is today perhaps the only steadfast.

Exponent of what is understood as Gandhism.

“You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,”.

“You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,” he declared, guaranteeing equality in Pakistan for all faiths and communities. He went further still: “in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim.

Jinnah’s speech on 11 August made it very clear that he intended Pakistan to be a secular state. “You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,” he declared, guaranteeing equality in Pakistan for all faiths and communities. He went further still: “in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim.

Community—because even as regards Muslims you have Pathans, Punjabis, Shias, Sunnis and so on and among Hindus you have Brahmins, Vashnavas, Khatris, also Bengalees, Madrasis and so on—will vanish,” he said. “Indeed if you ask me this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of India to attain freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free peoples long, long ago.” 40 These were peculiar words from the man who had long hindered independence precisely by reinforcing the division between Hindu and Muslim, and add weight to the theory that Jinnah may have been less serious about Pakistan as a Muslim homeland than as a playing piece.

Perhaps, all along, he had pursued not an Islamic state but rather a non-Hindumajority state. There was no time to worry about it. On 13 August, an exhausted Radcliffe delivered his award; the last few princely states were still squabbling over better deals; Gandhi, in Calcutta, tried desperately to hold Hindus and Muslims together; and Nehru, in Delhi, began to read reports of new outbreaks of disorder in the Punjab with growing concern. One hundred and fifty people, mostly Sikhs, had been murdered there in the previous.

For though there had been a revolution, the empire had not been overthrown. The British had got away with their dignity intact and their majesty undimmed.

Day, it brimmed with ordinary people. Where thirty thousand had been expected, at least ten times that number turned up; some estimates said as many as a million.

As a salute was fired, a rainbow broke across the sky—a detail that one would dismiss as fanciful, were it not for the fact that so many observers insisted they had seen it. 71 Mountbatten pointed up at this well-timed natural phenomenon, and the crowd went wild again. “I had never noticed how closely a rainbow could resemble the new Dominion flag of saffron, white and green,” he mused in his report to.

The next day, he was moved to tell Mountbatten’s press.

Attaché, “At last, after two hundred years, Britain has conquered India.” 73.

Gandhi had told him that there were two alternatives. Either British rule would be continued, or else there would be a bloodbath. “What should I do, then?” Mountbatten had asked. Gandhi’s reply was typical. “You must face the bloodbath and accept it.” 9.

Just eighteen months before, remembered the journalist Phillips Talbot, the naval mutineers in Bombay had roused great crowds with cries of “Death to Englishmen!” and “Britishers: Go Back!” Now the cry was “Jai England!” and “England zindabad!”.

Dickie was overjoyed and shouted “Jai Hind!” all the way along Marine Drive.

After 15 August, Mountbatten was the servant of the Union of India, and his prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had made unequivocal his opinion: “I would rather have every village in India go up in flames than keep a single British soldier in India a moment longer than necessary.” 38 Mountbatten’s staff agreed with Nehru.

Only seven British officers were killed in India between partition and the end of January 1948;.

Truth began to sink in. In 1946, Nehru had made three predictions to the journalist Jacques Marcuse. “One, India will never be a Dominion. Two, there will never be a Pakistan. Three, when the British go, there will be no more communal trouble in India.” Marcuse was back in.

In 1946, Nehru had made three predictions to the journalist Jacques Marcuse. “One, India will never be a Dominion. Two, there will never be a Pakistan. Three, when the British go, there will be no more communal trouble in India.” Marcuse was back in Delhi just after partition to interview him.

Again, but could not bring himself to remind Nehru of their previous conversation. In the end, Nehru brought it up himself. “You remember, Marcuse, what I told you? No Dominion, No Pakistan, No …” Both men were silent for a moment, until Nehru added wistfully, “Wasn’t I wrong?” 49.

As if such ordeals were not horrific enough, the media and public officials publicly glorified a distinctly feminine martyrdom. It was constantly suggested.

That the high point of female heroism was to commit suicide rather than face the “dishonor” of rape, as if the shame and guilt for the crime would fall on the victim rather than on the perpetrator.

In Stalin’s famous words, one death is a tragedy; one million deaths is a statistic.

What does it matter to the readers of history today whether there were two hundred thousand deaths, or a million, or two million? On that scale, is it possible to feel proportional revulsion, to be five times more upset at a million deaths than at two hundred thousand? Few can grasp the awfulness of how it might feel to have their fathers barricaded in their houses and burned alive, their mothers beaten and thrown off speeding trains, their daughters torn away, raped and branded, their sons held down in full view, screaming and pleading, while a mob armed with rough knives hacked off their hands and feet.

March had been the apogee of his power and influence; the 1930s a struggle, bitter and increasingly opposed, culminating in a private breakdown; the early 1940s a calamity, with the illjudged Quit India campaign and mass departure of Muslims from Congress; the later 1940s a wilderness, with his presence treated as an irritation. And yet, despite intense personal disaffection and marginalization by his colleagues, the Mahatma would rally for a final, spectacular swan song. With Calcutta detonating around him, he decided to fast.

On 2 September, the Mahatma renounced all food and sustenance except sips of water and reclined on a cot in a public room at the house in Belliaghatta. The effect was unprecedented. Over the course of little more than a day, the city calmed, and the processions to his house changed their.

Temper from angry mob to penitent pilgrimage. From all parties and all faiths, leaders came to beg with him to give up his fast and save his life. He replied that it was not a question of saving his life. The fast was “intended to stir the conscience and remove mental sluggishness”; if the people’s consciences were stirred, there might be the side effect that he would live. The hours passed, with burly goondas turning up to weep contritely by the Mahatma’s bedside. Finally, on the evening of 4 September, when all the city leaders had signed a pledge that there would be no further trouble in Calcutta, Gandhi broke his fast with a drink of fruit juice. 6 “In the Punjab we.

Have 55,000 soldiers and large scale rioting on our hands,” an awestruck Mountbatten wrote to him. “In Bengal our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting.” 7 To the wonder of all observers, Gandhi’s achievement would endure beyond his presence in the city. Aside from a few isolated incidents—no more than in normal times of peace— Calcutta remained orderly for months.

In Karol Bagh, between New and Old Delhi, children of all faiths were taking their matriculation examinations in a local high school, when goondas stormed in.

And demanded that the Muslim boys be separated from the rest. The boys were taken into another room and slaughtered like animals. 13.

To go under or overcome our difficulties. And we are not going under.” 40.

They have their Pakistan, we will have our Hindustan,” replied the man, at which Jawahar flew into a rage, grabbed him by the throat and shook him. “If I must die it is an honour to do so at your hands, Panditji,” gasped the man. Jawahar dropped him in disgust and returned to his car. 44.

While Dickie chaired committees, both Jawahar and Edwina fearlessly went out into the streets of Delhi to deal with the rioters. Edwina was with her friend, the health minister Amrit Kaur, when they heard that Jawahar had gone out alone. They went out and found him attempting to stop a crowd of armed men. “Brought him back!” Edwina wrote. 46 Another evening, Jawahar heard of an attack planned on the Jamia Millia Islamia, a Muslim college outside Delhi. The college was in the middle of riot-torn countryside. At night, the students, fearing for their lives, turned off their lamps and stood guard. They could hear splashes as Muslims from.

Nearby villages were chased into the Jumna River, pursued by mobs intent on drowning them.

To Patel’s embarrassment, Nehru put Mountbatten rather than him in charge of negotiation. Patel’s relationship with Nehru, never great, was rapidly souring. Patel made it clear that he thought Nehru was too soft on Muslims. Nehru made it clear that he disliked Patel’s Hindu-chauvinist tone.

With almost half of his cabinet tending toward the establishment of India as a Hindu nation, Nehru had to fight an increasingly hard battle against the swell of fundamentalist feeling.

77 “As long as I am at the helm of affairs India will not become a Hindu state,”.

77 “As long as I am at the helm of affairs India will not become a Hindu state,” Nehru announced in a public speech, with a deliberate dig at the orthodox members of his government. “.

If Nehru’s government fell, he warned, Patel would probably take over and install “an iron-handed system,” openly hostile to Pakistan.

It had always been assumed by the British, by the Muslim League and indeed largely by Congress apart from Nehru himself, that Kashmir would eventually go to Pakistan.

Instrument of accession.

But Nehru’s mind was filled with visions of losing his ancestral state to a plague of murderous tribesmen. Their faith did not.

Sam Manekshaw, India’s director of military operations, remembered the meeting that took place in Delhi at this time. Nehru, as usual, was attempting to contextualize the Kashmir situation, talking about it in relation to Russia, the United States, the United Nations and so on. Eventually, Patel exploded: “Jawaharlal, do you want Kashmir, or do you want to give it away?” “Of course I want Kashmir,” replied Nehru. Before he could add anything else, Patel turned to Manekshaw and said, “You have your orders.” It was Patel who went off to All-India Radio and.

Ordered a command requisitioning private aircraft, and Patel who organized the fly-in of Indian troops to Kashmir the next day. Only later did Mountbatten realize that the home minister must have had the whole operation planned in advance. 38.

He described Nehru and Patel as “enemies of Britain,” and the Muslims as Britain’s allies; and accused Mountbatten of planning and organizing “the first victory of Hindustan.

Their talks were almost always about ideas rather than gossip, but were never dry or sterile. Ideas were what made them passionate.

According to Nehru’s secretary, M. O. Mathai, Nehru paid a brief visit to Lucknow in the winter of that year. Sarojini Naidu was then the governor of the United Provinces, and a rumor spread that Nehru was in Lucknow to propose to his old girlfriend, Sarojini’s daughter Padmaja Naidu. Padmaja was ecstatic and prepared herself to accept. When Jawahar turned up, he was with Edwina. Padmaja locked herself in a room and refused to meet the governorgeneral’s wife. 86 Later, when Padmaja came to stay with him, Jawahar would find one of his framed photographs of Edwina smashed on the floor. 87.

To the distress of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel—never the best of friends—were developing a deep antipathy toward each other, splitting and stalling the government.

Many observers thought that once the freedom struggle was over, Congress should have split. 19 A strong right wing under Patel, and a strong left wing under Nehru, might have produced a balanced two-party system. But Congress stayed together, united more by sentimentality than by a common political goal. When.

The light has gone out from our lives and there is darkness everywhere,”.

And I do not know what to tell you and how to say.

And I do not know what to tell you and how to say it.”.

The light has gone out, I.

Said, and yet I was wrong. For the light that shone in this country was no ordinary light. The light that has illumined this country for these many, many years will illumine this country for many more years, and a thousand years later that light will still be seen in this country, and the world will see it, and it will give solace to innumerable hearts. For that light represented something more than the immediate present; it represented the living, eternal truths reminding us of the right path, drawing us from error, taking this ancient country to freedom.” 43.

The Indian government, he said, believed that Britain and the United States were backing Pakistan as part of their goal of maintaining Muslim solidarity in the Middle East. “It appears to me that Russia may well win India to her side by sponsoring her case,” he warned. “I must point out that if this does come to pass the only result will be that India is thrown into the arms of Russia; and Russia will appear throughout this country as the saviour of India against the machination of the United States and the United Kingdom.” 68.

I sometimes think our greatest crime against India.

Was to turn all her best sons into lawyers.”.

He was particularly concerned that India should become an oil-rich state. “Clearly the first requirement is to find the oil,” he noted. “To me it seems quite incredible that there should be oil to the north and west of India and oil to the east of India, but no oil has been found in India apart from Assam.” Geological surveys had previously drawn the conclusion that, incredible though it may have seemed, there really was none. No matter. Mountbatten recommended that they be redone.

The gods or some good fairy gave you beauty and high intelligence, and.

Grace and charm and vitality—great gifts—and she who possesses them is a great lady wherever she goes. But unto those who have, even more shall be given: and they gave you something that was even rarer than those gifts—the human touch, the love of humanity, the urge to serve those who suffer and who are in distress. And this amazing mixture of qualities results in a radiant personality and in the healer’s touch.

Wherever you have gone you have brought solace, and you have brought hope and encouragement. Is it surprising, therefore, that the people of India should love you and look up to you as one of themselves and should grieve that you are going? Hundreds of thousands have seen you personally in various camps and other places and in hospitals, and hundreds of thousands will be sorrowful at the news that you have gone. 111.

Jinnah saw Liaquat and told him that Pakistan was “the biggest blunder” of his life. Further yet, he declared, “If now I get an opportunity I will go to Delhi and tell Jawaharlal to forget about the follies of the past and become friends again.” 24 It is impossible to prove whether Jinnah actually said these words or not; either way, he was to have no further opportunity for a rapprochement.

Break open Rama’s heart, you will find Sita written on it; break open Nehru’s heart, you will find Lady Mountbatten written on it.”.

At 7:30 the next morning, the Turners’ secretary knocked on Edwina’s door. There was no reply. She opened it to see the Countess Mountbatten of Burma lying on the bed. Her body was already cold. She had suffered heart failure a few hours before. Still one of the world’s.

Richest women, she had had no splendid possessions with her; only a pile of old letters on the bedside table. She must have been reading them when she died, for a few, having fluttered from her hands, were strewn across her bed. They were all from Jawaharlal Nehru. 105.

Just as after the death of Gandhi, Nehru’s public face would be a mask, hiding his private grief.

The coffin was discharged into the waves from beneath a Union Jack. Mountbatten, in tears, kissed a wreath of flowers before throwing it into the sea. 111 The Wakeful was escorted by an Indian frigate, the Trishul. Jawaharlal Nehru had sent it all the way to the.

English Channel, just to cast a wreath of marigolds into the waves after Edwina’s coffin.

Began to bother a wider circle of people. “The Prime Minister is like the great banyan tree,” said S. K. Patil, the minister for food. “Thousands shelter beneath it but nothing grows.” 3 The remark irritated Nehru,.

Perhaps because it was true.

Padmaja had never married,” noted Marie Seton, “perhaps ever hoping to be asked by the man she so much loved.” 23 Soon, Nehru’s.

Padmaja had never married,” noted Marie Seton, “perhaps ever hoping to be asked by the man she so much loved.” 23.

Nehru had requested that most of his ashes be scattered from an airplane, “so that they might mingle with the dust and soil of India and become an indistinguishable part of India.”.

Unlike Jawahar, Indira found the processes of democratic government irritating and cumbersome. Soon she started to act without recourse to it. “My position among the people is uncontested,” she declared. 48 When she attacked the princes for their privy purses, Mountbatten was shocked and upset. “I do hope Indu will do nothing that could in any way dishonour her father’s word,” he wrote to Nan Pandit, “and I have written to her to this effect in.

As friendly a way as possible.” 49.

TODAY, THE India created by the Mountbattens, Nehru, Gandhi and Jinnah is on the way up.

Neither Nehru nor Jinnah has bequeathed exactly the legacy he would have wanted to his nation. Nehru’s vision encompassed an inclusive democracy, a planned economy and great investment in education. Some of these have fallen by the wayside, and he would have been horrified to observe the religious violence, disregard for the environment and callousness toward the.

Poor that have beleaguered India since his death.

Others have succeeded remarkably, notably in the culture of science and technology, the availability of education and the principle of secular democracy.

Others have succeeded remarkably, notably in the culture of science and technology, the availability of education and the principle of secular democracy. But Nehru had seventeen years at the head of India to make his mark. Jinnah had just one at the head of Pakistan.

There is still a picture of Edwina Mountbatten in Jawaharlal Nehru’s study.

India today is not Gandhi’s India, though there remains an enormous affection for him. There are elements of Gandhi’s India in the nation’s spirituality; elements of Nehru’s India in its education, culture and technology;.

And I feel like saying to these noblemen: ‘There is no solution for India unless you strip yourselves of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your countrymen in India.’.

# Chaos (James Gleick)

Until then the only way to approach highly nonlinear problems was with a device called perturbation theory. For purposes of calculation, you assume that the nonlinear problem is reasonably close to some solvable, linear problem—just a small perturbation away. You solve the linear problem and perform a complicated bit of trickery with the leftover part, expanding it into what are called Feynman diagrams. The more accuracy you need, the more of these agonizing diagrams you must produce.

He perceived no color at all, neither a rainbow nor individual hues. Looking at a clear white surface or a clear blue sky through the prism produced the same effect: uniformity. But if a slight spot interrupted the white surface or a cloud appeared in the sky, then he would see a burst of color. It is “the interchange of light and shadow,” Goethe concluded, that causes color. He.

“every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.”.

“How English you are Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.

It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.

“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”.

The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.

“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.

It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”.

Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?.

You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”.

Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? . . . You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t smile. . . . People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. . . . Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly. . . . Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing. . . . A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season. . . . The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”.

“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.”.

“How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!”.

“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.

I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after all—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I really do.”.

“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores, the better.”.

“I don’t desire to change anything in England except the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.”.

But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love.

Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect—simply a confession of failure.

I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a wonderful study.”.

The basis of optimism is sheer terror.

I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy.

We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.

But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.

“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”.

Art is always more abstract than we fancy.

It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him.

The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.

Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.

It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of Symbolistes. There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.

There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.

Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.

“I must speak, and you must listen.

“You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you think”;.

If we women did not love you for your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however, that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”.

“Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.”.

Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.

Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.”.

“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have searched for pleasure.”.

“The only horrible thing in the world is ennui, Dorian.

I have no terror of death. It is the coming of death that terrifies me.

“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”.

Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.”.

“one can survive everything nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.

But then one regrets the loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an essential part of one’s personality.” Dorian said nothing, but rose from.

“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that doesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”.

“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life.

One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after.

One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.

“Like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart.” Yes: that is what it was like.”.

What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose’—how does the quotation run?—‘his own soul?’”.

I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he would not have understood me.”.

You have changed, of course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder.

Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong.

I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets.”.

Art has no influence upon action. It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. That is all.

Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these?.


# The 48 Laws of Power (Robert Greene; Joost Elffers)

“Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.”.

Place your iron hand inside a velvet glove.

Treating everyone equally means ignoring their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who excel.

Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in return.

No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use of honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one’s noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a subtle form of coercion.

And they will be right: In truth, the use of honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one’s noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a subtle form of coercion.

The most important of these skills, and power’s crucial foundation, is the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings.

Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situations less controllable and heightens your enemy’s resolve. If you are trying to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep him off-guard by feigning friendliness than showing your anger.

“No days unalert.” Nothing should catch you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of your plan’s happy ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pitfall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you plan, the more powerful you become.

There are no principles; there are only events. There is no good and bad, there are only circumstances. The superior man espouses events and circumstances in order to guide them. If there were principles and fixed laws, nations would not change them as we change our shirts and a man can not be expected to be wiser than an entire nation.

Deception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what separates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive.

Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent weapon in the game of power.

Deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield. Patience.

If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield. Patience.

If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making moronic blunders. Like mastering your emotions, patience is a skill—it does not come naturally.

Never discriminate as to whom you study and whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, including friends and loved ones.

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.

Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine.

First you must flatter and puff up your master.

If you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite: Make him appear more intelligent than you.

Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.

Make it clear that your advice is merely an echo of his advice.

By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity.

If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

When you see water flowing uphill, it means that someone is repaying a kindness.

They forget the favors they have received and imagine they have earned their success by their own merits.

But friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody believes a friend can betray.

Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.

A brahman, a great expert in Veda who has become a great archer as well, offers his services to his good friend, who is now the king. The brahman cries out when he sees the king, “Recognize me, your friend!” The king answers him with contempt and then explains: “Yes, we were friends before, but our friendship was based on what power we had.... I was friends with you, good brahman, because it served my purpose. No pauper is friend to the rich, no fool to the wise, no coward to the brave. An old friend—who needs him? It is two men of equal wealth and equal birth who contract friendship and marriage, not a rich man and a pauper.... An old friend—who needs him? THE MAHABHARATA, C. THIRD CENTURY B.C.

While a friend expects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former enemies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for the man who has pardoned him. In time, these former enemies became Sung’s most trusted friends.

Pick up a bee from kindness, and learn the limitations of kindness.

In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in error. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable enemies who must be destroyed. “Why, madam,” Lincoln replied, “do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”.

Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure.

The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other’s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes—maybe they mean it, often they do not.

People want to feel they deserve their good fortune.

The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are deserving.

The more favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.

Ingratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers for so many centuries, that it is truly amazing.

Kissinger made a policy of working with those who disagreed with him. Colleagues commented that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.

Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert.

It is sometimes better, then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends or allies.

Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent enemies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even turning a friend into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China’s disagreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese Communism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the words you could possibly put together. Never let the presence of enemies.

Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power.

In 1937 the Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao’s Communists and their enemy, the Nationalists. Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be the perfect training for the Communists’ ragtag army. Mao’s plan was adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat the Nationalists. Years later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his country’s invasion of China. Mao interrupted, “Should I not thank you instead?” Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot grow stronger. Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the Japanese would be defeated in time.

A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.

Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your real enemies lie.

Nothing is stable in the realm of power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of enemies.

She patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to see that other women are interested in him, too.

You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the scent.

To surrender to your guidance they must be appropriately confused. You have to scramble your signals—appear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.

On Ninon’s instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at affairs where the countess expected to see him.

Then, suddenly, he would appear at salons he had never frequented before, but that the countess attended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for successful seduction.

Deep down inside, they often sense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other person to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the scent.

For sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security.

This was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show of passion.

Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts.

Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.

Most people will believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.

Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will be thrown off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations.

During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted—to advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it. Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France.

Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—just not your real ones.

Napoleon’s minister Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing some apparent secret. This feigned confidence—a decoy—would then elicit a real confidence on the other person’s part.

The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other person’s superiority—these are perfect diversionary devices.

You actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your victims, drawing them into your web.

The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt’s face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, “Never was a face less of a barometer.” Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off-guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it, “While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration.”.

Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a series of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behavior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.

A sheep never marauds, a sheep never deceives, a sheep is magnificently dumb and docile. With a sheepskin on his back, a fox can pass right into the chicken coop.

The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he appeared—a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect.

Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses. They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and they will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to your brief comments will only add to your power.

As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by talking to them.

The less he said about his work, the more people talked about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.

Break. Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction.

Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by the price you pay.

The verbose are not perceived as sly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated.

The more you talk, in fact, the less suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can practice deception with greater ease. LAW 5 SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION—GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE JUDGMENT Reputation is the cornerstone of power.

For, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our friends have our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found.

Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they can deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so desperately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mistakes. This is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from.

It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900.

But gentle barbs and mockery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at your rival’s expense.

As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, or utter a single word.

Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This single quality—efficiency, say, or seductiveness—becomes a kind of calling card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. Casanova.

Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This single quality—efficiency, say, or seductiveness—becomes a kind of calling card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so romantically successful.

In such cases it is wise to associate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name to whitewash and elevate yours.

Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies—that reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation.

On the other hand, an attack on another man’s reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, and your own thus-far-small reputation gives him a small target when he tries to return your fire.

Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in itself—Oscar Wilde used it to great advantage.

Since we must live in society and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation.

“A name without fame is like fire without flame. There is nothing like attracting notice at any cost.”.

Barnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking the street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE MUSIC FOR THE MILLIONS. What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to hear the free concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the museum, where they would be out of earshot of the.

But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the museum, where they would be out of earshot of the band’s noise, and of the booing of the crowd.

The quality of the attention is irrelevant.

The worst fate in the world for a man who yearns fame, glory, and, of course, power is to be ignored.

Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the general mediocrity.

Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.

People feel superior to the person whose actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing against.

People feel superior to the person whose actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing against their expectations, you both gain their respect and tighten your hold on their fleeting attention.

Enigmatic instantly draws attention. Never make it too.

Never make it too clear what you are doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery heightens.

Never make it too clear what you are doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery heightens your presence; it also creates anticipation—everyone will be watching you to see what happens next.

The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what cannot be seized and consumed creates power.

Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable.

By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will then magnify that aura by constantly trying to interpret you.

Come off but for the deft diplomacy of Henry.

How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggressive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing him much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon everything turns against him. His numerous enemies band together; trying to maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in this direction and that, and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggressive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of moves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one. Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever-growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against him.

You have mistaken aggressive action for effective action.

Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull him, just as Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his daring escape and return to power.

Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.

Science is neutral and reason superior.

The military engineer was the quintessence of the Arguer, a type found everywhere among us. The Arguer does not understand that words are never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intelligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the person he is dealing with. Since each man believes that he is right, and words will rarely convince him otherwise, the arguer’s reasoning falls on deaf ears. When cornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Once he has made the other person feel insecure and inferior in his beliefs, the eloquence of Socrates could not save the situation.

No one is offended, and your point is proven.

Or perhaps something you said inadvertently even offended them—words have that insidious ability to be interpreted according to the other person’s mood and insecurities.

Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded by bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more powerful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to see—“Yes, now the statue’s nose does look just right.” There are no offensive words, no possibility of misinterpretation. No one can argue with a demonstrated proof. As Baltasar Gracián remarks, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.”.

The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them literally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than argument.

Sleepiness can be infectious, and yawning as well. In large-scale strategy when the enemy is agitated and shows an inclination to rush, do not mind in the least. Make a show of complete calmness, and the enemy will be taken by this and will become relaxed. You infect their spirit. You can infect them with a carefree, drunklike spirit, with boredom, or even weakness.

When you suspect you are in the presence of an infector, don’t argue, don’t try to help, don’t pass the person on to your friends, or you will become enmeshed. Flee the infector’s presence or suffer the consequences.

Those misfortunates among us who have been brought down by circumstances beyond their control deserve all the help and sympathy we can give them. But there are others who are not born to misfortune or unhappiness, but who draw it upon themselves by their destructive actions and unsettling effect on others. It would be a great thing if we could raise them up, change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end up getting inside and changing us. The reason is simple—humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking of those with whom they spend their time.

“Let us kill him and then worship him as our patron saint.”.

“Toil and sraeat! The more you try, the more you have to suffer.” When they reached the tavern, the owner said; “Why should I fodder two horses when I carry all on one? I had better give the one all the food it wants, and cut the throat of the other; at least I shall have the hide.” And so he did.

Without making sure that he was truly indispensable. Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do not make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along who can do the job as well as they can—someone younger, fresher, less expensive, less threatening.

Do not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak masters who serve as your front. The completely independent man would live in a cabin in the woods—he would have the freedom to come and go as he pleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse independence: Their need for you frees you.

Ancient China this was called “giving before you take”—the giving makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking.

Learn to give before you take.

And the giving can take many forms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an “honest” admission—whatever it takes.

Gratitude is often a terrible burden that he gladly discards.

Most men are so thoroughly subjective that nothing really interests them but themselves.

When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.

What they do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time. In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries.

When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to massacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted him), Ch‘u-Ts’ai told him that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it really wasn’t mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch‘u-Ts’ai knew Khan well. He was a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culture, or indeed for anything other than warfare and practical results. Ch‘u-Ts’ai chose to appeal to the only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.

Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause, their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away.

Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble. They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice, which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce you to powerful people—provided, of course, that all this is done in public, and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better).

It’s not as if you are conning them by asking for help—it is really their pleasure to give, and to be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful.

It’s not as if you are conning them by asking for help—it is really their pleasure to give, and to be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people and figure out what makes them tick.

When they want to look charitable and noble, do not appeal to their greed.

Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.

Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes.

Controlling what they say, they often keep the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses,.

Controlling what they say, they often keep the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior motives, obsessions.

If you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you a lie, look as though you believed every word he said. This will give him courage to go on; he will become more vehement in his assertions, and in the end betray himself. Again, if you perceive that a person is trying to conceal something from you, but with only partial success, look as though you did not believe him. The opposition on your part will provoke him into leading out his reserve of truth and bringing the whole force of it to bear upon your incredulity.

“Truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.”.

This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our enemies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from doing away with them.

This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our enemies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of us. We have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful vipers who will one day kill us.

This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our enemies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of us. We have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful vipers who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt with this way. It must be exterminated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt us.

Only one side can win, and it must win totally.

There is nothing they want more than to eliminate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take revenge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.

The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.

The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bidding. This law has applications far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the insidious viper that will eat away at your victory, so give your enemies nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room.

There will be people you cannot win over, who will remain your enemies no matter what.

But whatever wound you inflicted on them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally.

Just recognize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as you stay in power. If.

And if they cannot be banished, at least understand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever friendliness they feign.

“Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but often of indigestion.”.

To prevent this you need to starve the other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatening them with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of presence and absence.

Do not presume to know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please him. Never inject your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchallenged and at peace.

Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others generally figure that when you do something, it’s for an intelligent reason. So it’s really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance. You’re better off acting capriciously.”.

That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a fortress and you lose contact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happening around you, as well as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you cut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends.

The weight of society’s pressure to conform, and the lack of distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly about what is going on around you.

A temporary recourse, then, isolation can help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has been produced in prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write The Prince only once he found.

When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind of respect.

You cannot inadvertently allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone.

You need to stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.

Put yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy, will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention, you will immediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entanglements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top. You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.

People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful,.

Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

Men of great abilities are slow to act. for it is easier to avoid occasions for committing yourself than to come well out of a commitment.

Alexander. Isabella understood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way offended.

Isabella understood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm’s length. Isabella began by sending him gifts—falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks, which she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She sent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also acted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some troops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade him politely, knowing full well that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never leave. Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about him, since he had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion.

The merit of supporting a state in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving a ruined one.”.

People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, you will commit to another, different cause, since you gave yourself so easily to this one.

Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner independence—to keep yourself from getting emotionally involved. Preserve the unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your freedom if the side you are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places to go once you jump ship.

No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smart—and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.

“You should know that foolish people are a hundredfold more averse to meeting the wise than the wise are indisposed for the company of the foolish.

On the other hand, it is a real recommendation to be stupid. For just as warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does the mind good to feel its superiority; and a man will seek company likely to give him this feeling, as instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk in the sun if he wants to get warm. But this means that he will be disliked on account of his superiority; and if a man is to be liked, he must really be inferior in point of intellect.

What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreaction to the moves of our enemies and rivals.

What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreaction to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much as the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other kind of aggression.

Do not resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that this often neutralizes their behavior—they expected, even wanted you to react with force and so they are caught off-guard and confounded by your lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have defeated you.

Inwardly you stay firm, but outwardly you bend.

And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs, as if they felt their followers were less important than their own glory.

Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for a genius rather than a workaholic.

Learn to flatter indirectly—by downplaying your own contribution, for example, to make your master look bet ter.

Wax, a substance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the application of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you please. In the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make people pliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed and malevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.

The pseudo-belief in equality—the idea that talking and acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you somehow a paragon of civilization—is a terrible mistake.

Do not ask for favors on another person’s behalf, least of all a friend’s.

The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatly valued.

The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you would commit great sins against beauty and decorum.

Never be so self-absorbed as to believe that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how accurate they are.

Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the courtier’s art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around him.

Them had been a favorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand.

Our good name and reputation depend more on what we conceal than on what we reveal. Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for such moments.

Would rather betray the whole world than let the world betray me.

It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a convenient object.

In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a close associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.” Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out, sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention. But this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a threat to the king’s reputation. The public would readily believe in the scapegoat’s guilt—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were guilty? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming arrogant and even disdainful of him.

Let only the good come from you and the evil from others.

Emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking.

People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something.

Keep your words vague but full of promise ; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking.

In searching, as you must, for the methods that will gain you the most power for the least effort, you will find the creation of a cultlike following one of the most effective. Having a large following opens up all sorts of possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong. You might think it a gargantuan task to create such.

As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of something to believe in.

Always in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make yourself the object of worship. Make people form a cult around you.

First, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be described as a member of this devious force.

You have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react against, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to believe in and infidels to destroy.

To become the founder of a new religion one must be psychologically infallible in one’s knowledge of a certain average type of souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together.

Men are so simple of mind, and so much dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty who are ready to be deceived.

If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.

The path of pleasure never leads to glory!.

Bolder the lie, the more convincing it becomes.

The sheer audacity of the story makes it more credible, distracting attention from its inconsistencies.

People have a sixth sense for the weaknesses of others.

Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move makes you seem.

Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave.

You enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your own path. When a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options where there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Retreating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares.

Although we may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a desire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite—we are really self-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us.

Casanova’s boldness was not revealed in a daring approach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it consisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention understood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flattering than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show hesitation or doubt, simply because he never felt it.

Part of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed, temporarily outside of ourselves and the usual doubts that permeate our lives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is broken, because we become aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of their self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and keeps the illusion alive. It never induces awkwardness or embarrassment. And so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self-confidence infects us and draws us outside our own realm of inwardness and reflection.

Tell you on behalf of women: there is not one of us who does not prefer a little rough handling to too much consideration. Men lose through blundering more hearts than virtue saves. The more timidity a lover shows with us the more it concerns our pride to goad him on; the more respect he has for our resistance, the more.

“A reasonable man in love may act like a madman, but he should not and cannot act like an idiot.”.

There are very few men—and they are the exceptions—who are able to think and feel beyond the present moment.

Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.

Often enough, God gives a man a glimpse of happiness, and then utterly ruins him.

But improvisation will only bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking.

But improvisation will only bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking several steps ahead and planning to the end.

From the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal: to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nationalism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian territory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German kingdoms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a united Germany.

Men, on the other hand, were seen as victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see beyond immediate dangers.

Most people believe that they are in fact aware of the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually deluded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want the future to be.

Will this have unintended consequences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy ones—do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind.

The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines who gets the glory, the money, the prize.

The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your conclusion must be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind.

Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.

What is understandable is not awe-inspiring—we tell ourselves we could do as well if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how clever you are—it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your cleverness.

We tend to want the world to know what we have done—we want our vanity gratified by having our hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sympathy for the hours it has taken to reach our point of artistry.

The more mystery surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems.

Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the options.

Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the options. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you, and you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate.

Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the options. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you, and you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate. In this method of controlling people’s options, they choose the option that gives you power because the alternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but indirectly: They seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.

J. P. Morgan Sr. once told a jeweler of his acquaintance that he was interested in buying a pearl scarf-pin. Just a few weeks later, the jeweler happened upon a magnificent pearl. He had it mounted in an appropriate setting and sent it to Morgan, together with a bill for $5,000. The following day the package was returned. Morgan’s accompanying note read: “I like the pin, but I don’t like the price. If you will accept the enclosed check for $4,000, please send back the box with the seal unbroken.” The enraged jeweler refused the check and dismissed the messenger in disgust. He opened up the box to reclaim the unwanted pin, only to find that it had.

For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much more powerful imposition of your own will.

This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him. This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.

Push them to “choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.

In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to create an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began secretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller altered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had were the ones he gave them. In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it doesn’t matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all costs.

Who will fall for the idea that they are getting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.

Emotions—use fear and terror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to procrastinate.

This tactic is similar to “Color the Choices,” but with the weak you have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions—use fear and terror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to procrastinate.

The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They have to answer the lawyer’s questions, but whatever they say they hurt themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave.

The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more forcefully he could act against them in the long run. LAW 32 PLAY TO PEOPLE’S FANTASIES JUDGMENT The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.

People the illusion of choice. On the other hand, by limiting other people’s options you sometimes limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan your deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James Rothschild liked this method:.

There are situations in which it is to your advantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan your deceptions.

The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.

People rarely believe that their problems arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity.

People rarely believe that their problems arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out there is to blame—the other, the world, the gods—and so salvation comes from the outside as well.

The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful—mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens’ ancestors had mustered to create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand—in this case the romance of alchemy—was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.

To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around you—and pleasure comes from playing to people’s fantasies. Never promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the moon, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.

If you want to tell lies that will be believed, don’t tell the truth that won’t.

The Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit of luck, a fair amount of self-sacrifice, and a lot of patience. The Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in one’s fortunes, bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one fantastic stroke.

Thurneisser offered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery.

Island of Formosa (now Taiwan),.

Bizarre customs. After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about Formosa—its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture—he had invented. He had built on the English public’s ignorance.

After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about Formosa—its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture—he had invented.

The Reality: Society is fragmented and full of conflict. The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union of souls.

Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches.

The Moon. Unattainable, always changing shape, disappearing and reappear ing. We look at it, imagine, wonder, and pine—never fa miliar, continuous provoker of dreams. Do not offer the obvious. Promise the moon.

A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embellished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic conception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one who always tells the truth, who never romances.... I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid,” 1875-1976).

So keep it light—never come too close to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely hazardous.

One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man’s president.

Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested—the appearance of a sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk.

Someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it indirectly. If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved,.

If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly flatter him. If he laps up your compliments, no matter how obvious, you are on the right track. Train your eye for details—how someone tips a waiter, what delights a person, the hidden messages in clothes.

People who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the shy are dying for attention.

The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and unhappiness.

The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for the chronically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness.

When entering the court, find the weak link. The person in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes—the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.

When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatisfied, the unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses and have needs that you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which you place your thumbnail and turn them at will.

Infamous mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers. What Catherine learned from the experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a woman over without having to rely on his status,.

What Catherine learned from the experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a woman over without having to rely on his status, which he had inherited rather than earned. And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long as the woman began the affair by acting as if she had been conquered, the man would fail to notice that as time passed the mistress had come to hold power over him, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri. It was Catherine’s strategy to turn this weakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer and control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the court, her “flying squadron,” on men whom she knew shared her husband’s vulnerability.

Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot be controlled.

The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person. This may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however, they are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they really are. A man’s need to conquer women actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers out of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most visible—their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions they cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what people cannot control, you can control for them.

“Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die fighting for the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your own blood your royal rights granted by God’s grace. Whether upon the scaffold or upon the battlefield makes no difference to the glorious staking of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God’s grace!” On he went, appealing to William’s sense of honor and the majesty of his position as head of the army. How could the king allow people to push him around? Wasn’t the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words? Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his wife and his parliament, he persuaded him to build up the army—Bismarck’s goal all along.

Bismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He knew that William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. William secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a show of courage often conceals a man’s timidity, William’s timidity concealed his need to show courage and thump his chest.

Timidity is a potent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposite—to be Napoleons.

Remember: Look to the opposites and never take appearances at face value.

The Thumbscrew. Your enemy has secrets that he guards, thinks thoughts he will not reveal. But they come out in ways he cannot help. It is there some where, a groove of weakness on his head, at his heart, over his belly. Once you find the groove, put your thumb in it and turn him at will.

The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.

Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumminess gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love.

Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumminess gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth the guillotine—the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they were never there.

Frequent guest in the palace. In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who centuries earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on her treasury lifted, Isabella.

In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who centuries earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on her treasury lifted, Isabella felt she could finally respond to the demands of her explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important, she had a contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on which he had insisted. The only one she denied—and only in the contract’s fine print—was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered: an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause been left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the wealthiest family on the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.) Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire the best navigator he could find to help him get there.) The mission failed to find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance an even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things.

As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the latitude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, and treated his crew badly.

As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the latitude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how to sell himsel£ How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low-level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate himself with the highest royal and aristocratic families?.

He projected a sense of confidence that was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence the aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstart—it was a quiet and calm self-assurance. In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the nobility themselves. The powerful in the old-style aristocracies felt no need to prove or assert themselves; being noble, they knew they always deserved more, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, for he carried himself just the way they did—elevated above the crowd, destined for greatness.

It is within your power to set your own price. How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuffle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this reflects your character. But this behavior is not you—it is only how you have chosen to present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Columbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born to wear a crown.

First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the highest person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy: By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.

Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer’s good friend Titian. Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his own aristocratic stamp.

The gift strategy is subtle and brilliant because you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens to have more money.

The Crown. Place it upon your head and you assume a different pose—tranquil yet radiating assurance. Never show doubt, never lose your dignity beneath the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a coronation; the great est emperors crown themselves.

“Now you can see, my friends and allies, that perseverance is more effective than brute strength and that there are many difficulties that cannot be overcome if you try to do everything at once, but which will yield if you master them little by little. The truth is that a steady continuous effort is irresistible, for this is the way in which Time captures and subdues the greatest powers on earth. Now Time, you should remember, is a good friend and ally to those who use their intelligence to choose the right moment, but a most dangerous enemy to those who rush into action at the wrong one.”.

Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even of those who further it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion. That was the side Fouche wanted to be on.

Fouché always looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry him to power, and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and turns, and never miss the boat.

Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the limitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. Time, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully altered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, it follows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will move much more slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to lengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and anger close off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement in the art of timing.

First, when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see further into the future.

Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people dangle in front of you, and will.

Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another impatient sucker.

Third, you will have more room to be flexible.

Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the next without completing the first one.

Do not be a flash in the pan—success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.

Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come.

The slower the magician’s hands move, the easier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has appeared instantaneously.

“The more slowly a story is told,” he said, “the shorter it seems.”.

Going slower also makes what you are doing more interesting—the audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which time whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the hypnotist’s power to alter perceptions of time.

Do not be one of those people who look like paragons of patience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a close: Patience is worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your opponent at the right moment.

They say that if you see a prodigy and do not treat it as such, its character as a prodigy is destroyed.

That is the powerful move. What you do not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement.

The best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to oblivion by ignoring it.

Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your interest is too strong—it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.

They will respond with a desire of their own, which is simply to have an effect on you—perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they want to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of seduction. If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them play by your rules.

That was the weapon of King Louis XIV—if he did not like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by cutting off the dynamic of interaction.

That was the weapon of King Louis XIV—if he did not like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when you play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can do without them.

First there is the sour-grapes approach. If there is something you want but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw attention to your disappointment by complaining about it. An infinitely more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first place.

Crying “sour grapes” is sometimes seen as a reflection of the weak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful.

Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people’s attention by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away, or answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly, when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best response is often to make less of your mistake by treating it lightly.

Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without affectation.

You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow and fester unless you attend to them.

Learn to distinguish between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating,.

The words people use to persuade us virtually invite us to reflect on them with words of our own; we mull them over, and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part of our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up associations unintended by the speaker. The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for reflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable thoughts.

“The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.”.

If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

Disagreement is regarded as offensive because it is a condemnation of the views of others;.

The wise man avoids being contradicted as sedulously as he avoids contradicting; the publicity of censure is withheld from that which readily provokes it. Thought is free; it cannot and should not be coerced; retire into the sanctuary of your silence and if you sometimes allow yourself to break it, do so under the aegis of a discreet few.

People who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a disdain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance of the exotic.

They are using the outward appearance of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose beliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively nonetheless.

You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of your disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will understand the irony involved. You are protected.

And there will always be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of their time.

Martyrdom serves no purpose—better to live on in an oppressive world, even to thrive in.

It is also well to avoid correcting people’s mistakes in conversation, however good your intentions may be; for it is easy to offend people, and difficult, if not impossible to mend them.

The man who comes into the world with the notion that he is really going to instruct it in matters of the highest importance, may thank his stars if he escapes with a whole skin. ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER,.

For a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever believe what I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth, I hide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.

The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the group in which you find yourself.

People will swallow the bait because it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas.

Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you.

Oscar Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this foundation: He made it clear that he disdained the usual ways of doing things, and when he gave public readings his audiences not only expected him to insult them but welcomed it.

Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

“Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this information had any bearing on Your Majesty’s glory or my own,”.

As Talleyrand later said, “This is the beginning of the end.”.

At first it may strike fear and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, other responses emerge—embarrassment and uneasiness about the shouter’s capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has been said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you are gone. In the face of a conspiracy against.

Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you are gone.

To show your frustration is to show that you have lost your power to shape events;.

He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible men had had reason to turn against him, and could have listened and learned from them. He could have tried to win them back to him. He could even have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or death an ominous display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing after-effects—just a quiet and definitive severing of ties.

Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They only create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weakness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.

If possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone.... To speak angrily to a person, to show your hatred by what you say or by the way you look, is an unnecessary proceeding-dangerous, foolish, ridiculous, and vulgar.

Once the water is stirred up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become, the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you have made, and they drown.

A sovereign should never launch an army out of anger, a leader should never start a war out of wrath.

Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems out of proportion to what occasioned it.

Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take personally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the end they lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-control.

We have to realize that nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.

Our anger often stems from problems in our childhood, from the problems of our parents which stem from their own childhood, on and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An individual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to us. If a person explodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you—do not be so vain.

You will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You keep your head while they are losing theirs.

You keep your head while they are losing theirs.

Nothing is as infuriating as a man who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your advantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse. When they embarrass themselves with a temper tantrum, you will have gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their childishness you have maintained your dignity and composure.

What is offered for free is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price—there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.

Generosity softens people up—to be deceived.

By gaining a reputation for liberality, you win people’s admiration while distracting them from your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies.

The Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has a definite function in power: It attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be used strategically, with a definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on the other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired by all.

“Fret thyself no longer, but take a stone and put it in the same place, and think that it is your lump of gold; for, as you never meant to use it. the one will do you as much good as the other.”.

The worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.

“Nothing is more costly than something given free of charge.”.

Power requires self-discipline.

The suddenly rich believe that more is always possible. The free lunch, the money that will fall into your lap, is just around the corner.

In this delusion the greedy neglect everything power really depends on: self-control, the goodwill of others, and so on.

Exception—death—no lasting change in fortune comes quickly. Sudden wealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid.

Sudden wealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid.

Understand: With one exception—death—no lasting change in fortune comes quickly. Sudden wealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid. Never let lust for money lure you out of the protective and enduring fortress of real power. Make power your goal and money will find its way to you. Leave El Dorado for suckers and fools.

Best spend freely, then, and create a reputation for generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends.

Never let financial details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you.

Their resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them well. Your money will buy their submission better than your displays of power.

A gift also involves an indebtedness or obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you can be sure they expect something in return, and that to get it they are making you feel indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely conscious on their part, but this is how it works.).

Money may determine power relationships, but those relationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also depend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because you have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that Aretino played on Italy’s aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the facade of power through an alchemy that transforms money into influence.

The base of its power was not money but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that would restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed.

To secure his fortune he had to “waste” it. That is strategic generosity in a nutshell—the ability to be flexible with your wealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people’s hearts.

By spending on the arts, Lorenzo diluted people’s opinions of the ugly source of his wealth, disguising himself in nobility. There is no better use of strategic generosity than that of distracting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself in the mantle of art or religion.

First he would ignore his victim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his son had been given a well-paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally in his home region, or that he had been given a painting he had long coveted. Presents would flow from Louis’s hands. Finally, weeks or months later, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who had once vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the desire to fight. A straightforward bribe would have made him rebellious; this was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in which nothing could take root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds.

To succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be remarkable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before, or for being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more often you give to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes. If they don’t take your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of ingratitude, they will resent what appears to be charity. The sudden, unexpected, one-time gift will not spoil your children; it will keep them under your thumb.

The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick. Friends who offer favors without asking for payment will later want something far dearer than the money you would have paid them.

Solomon opted wisely for pacifism, yielding warlike things to his father.

Develop into the kind of strong ruler who would reinvigorate.

Great generals would tremble in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in preparing a dish and committed suicide rather than face the king’s wrath.

Louis XIV had many mistresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the most brilliant minds of the.

Louis XIV had many mistresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles: Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his own palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this was a new order he had founded, one without precedent.

As Machiavelli states, necessity is what impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and decay are left.

While other sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip’s name from history by surpassing his accomplishments.

Alexander also resented the fact that Philip had conquered most of Greece: “My father will go on conquering till there is nothing extraordinary left for me to do,” he once complained. While other sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip’s name from history by surpassing his accomplishments.

Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, “Men of Macedonia, see there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot pass from one table to another without falling.”.

One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a flock of sheep into a den of lions.

A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power. In chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to isolate the enemy’s forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and ineffectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy them—you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the game of power, isolation spells death.

He silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn them away from him, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on his own.

To seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the charm will wear off.

“Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need not fear his revenge,”.

If you apply this Law, in other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.

Marie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country’s dissatisfaction because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of deception.

Such types live in their own bubble—they seem to feel they are born kings and queens, and that attention is owed them.

Pampered and indulged as children, as adults they still believe that everything must come to them; convinced of their own charm, they make no effort to charm, seduce, or gently persuade.

The key to persuasion is softening people up and breaking them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses.

Be alert to both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology) and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses).

Educated and well-read himself, in his speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public’s deepest anxieties and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings.

Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway to deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with their individual psychologies.

The more they talk, the more they reveal about their likes and dislikes—the handles and levers to move them with.

The people who are best at appealing to people’s minds are often artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intellectual who can appeal concretely to people’s minds. Kings have always kept a stable of writers in their barn: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire (until they quarreled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Conversely, Napoleon III’s alienation of writers such as Victor Hugo, whom he exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of expression, and useful to pacify and exploit them.

By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.

We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes a love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

You look deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their values, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making yourself into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge of love.

Normally, people bombard us with their experiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things through our eyes.

The power of verbal argument is extremely limited, and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended.

The Moral Effect is a perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action.

The Moral Effect is a perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action. Quite simply, you teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine.

In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you, and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly what they did to you.

This technique is often used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with unpleasant and unconscious behavior.

A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real, which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description does.

Talking in parables is often the best way to teach a lesson, for it allows people to realize the truth on their own.

Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you.

Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud your reason: Just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel. If reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and find ways to disguise the change and sweeten the poison.

Human psychology contains many dualities, one of them being that even while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also irritated and upset by changes that affect them personally.

A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of history.

Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he faced, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”.

Once success happens your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in your own circle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind. Feelings of inferiority gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens their feelings of stagnation.

Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard calls “unhappy admiration,” takes hold. You may not see it but you will feel it someday—unless, that is, you learn strategies of deflection, little sacrifices to the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance occasionally,.

Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard calls “unhappy admiration,” takes hold. You may not see it but you will feel it someday—unless, that is, you learn strategies of deflection, little sacrifices to the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance occasionally, purposefully revealing a defect, weakness, or anxiety, or attributing your success to luck; or simply find yourself new friends. Never underestimate the power of envy.

“And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it, in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to come from others, and not from him.”.

“Envy is a weed that should not be watered.”.

Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with those below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their support in times of need.

By making others aware of their inferior position, you are only stirring up “unhappy admiration,” or envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories. The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over others is inconsequential next to the reality of it.

He may be smarter than I am, we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power, but that’s because he cheats. If we do not slander him, perhaps we praise him excessively—another of envy’s disguises.

Let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it can move you to greater heights.

Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively accept the facade they show you—read between the lines of their criticisms, their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the problem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late.

Your excuses, your false humility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem.

Subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people, and the need for envy less acute.

According to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon, the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves, as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice.

Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a potential.

Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubles and you turn a potential danger (envy) into a source of moral support (pity).

Excessive praise is an almost sure sign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up for a fall—it will be impossible for you to live up to their praise—or they are sharpening their blades behind your back.

At the same time, those who are hypercritical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you as well. Recognize their behavior as disguised envy and you keep out of the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart.

Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think you are condescending to them.

Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own creation.

The effects of envy are more serious among colleagues and peers, where there is a veneer of equality.

“Envy is the tax which all distinction must pay.”.

The envious man dies not only once but as many times as the person he envies lives to hear the voice of praise; the eternity of the latter’s fame is the measure of the former’s punishment: the one is immortal in his glory, the latter in his misery.

There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dangerous.

When you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy.

When you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to establish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust.

Powerful. People who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to please a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to the risk of making the master suspicious of you.

“Always stop with a victory.”.

As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. Inflicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge.

By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move.

A game of go—called wei-chi in China—can last up to three hundred moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encircle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indirect until the end of the game, when the winner can surround the opponent’s stones at an accelerated pace.

Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your enemies—by the time they figure out where you are and what you are up to, it is too late.

The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally.

The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your opponents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles’ heel. And they will hit it again and again.

A German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Rothschild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had been hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political climate, whatever it was—the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII, the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848, the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852.

Adeptly practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically different position from a king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character.

A queen is in a radically different position from a king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors one side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emotional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authoritarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of governing that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct, male form.

# Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think (Hans Rosling)

Over the past twenty years, the proportion of the global population living in extreme poverty has halved. This is absolutely revolutionary. I consider it to be the most important change that has happened in the world in my lifetime. It is also a pretty basic fact to know about life on Earth.

There are only a very few countries in the world—exceptional places like Afghanistan or South Sudan—where fewer than 20 percent of girls finish primary school, and at most 2 percent of the world’s girls live in such countries.

Only 9 percent of the world lives in low-income countries.

The idea of a divided world with a majority stuck in misery and deprivation is an illusion. A complete misconception. Simply wrong.

What should “we” call “them” instead?.

The gap instinct makes us imagine division where there is just a smooth range, difference where there is convergence, and conflict where there is agreement.

Mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality.

Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small. In.

Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small. In the same way, it is natural for people living on Level 4 to see the world as divided into just two categories: rich (at the top of the building, like you) and poor (down there, not like you). It is natural to look down and say “oh, they are all poor.” It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all.

The reality is often not polarized at all. Usually the majority is right there in the middle, where the gap is supposed to be.

It’s just an average, and with averages we must always remember that there’s a spread.

I’m a very serious “possibilist.” That’s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.

I’m a very serious “possibilist.” That’s something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.

Poor parents who can’t afford to send all their children to school have often prioritized the boys. But since 1970 there has been fantastic progress. Across religions, cultures, and continents, almost all parents can now afford to send all their children to school, and are sending their daughters as well as their sons. Now the girls have almost caught up: 90 percent of girls of primary school age attend school. For boys, the figure is 92 percent. There’s almost no difference.

The loss of hope is probably the most devastating consequence of the negativity instinct and the ignorance it causes.

Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator. The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Absolutely. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? No, not at all. Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. It’s both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time.

When we hang on to a rose-tinted version of history we deprive ourselves and our children of the truth.

I had first learned about the effect of doubling at school. In the Indian legend, the Lord Krishna asks for one grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard, then two grains on the second square, four grains on the third square, then eight, and so on, doubling the number of grains each time. By the time he gets to the last of the 64 squares, he is owed 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains of rice: enough to cover the whole of India with a layer of rice 30 inches deep. Anything that keeps doubling grows much faster than we first assume.

Numbers are freely available online, from the UN website, but free access to data doesn’t turn into knowledge without effort.

Nepal is one of the last Asian countries left on Level 1, and in 2015 it was hit by an earthquake. The death rate is always higher when a disaster hits a country on Level 1, because of poorly constructed buildings, poor infrastructure, and poor medical facilities. Nine thousand people died.

The UN’s ReliefWeb has become a global coordinator for disaster help—something earlier generations of disaster victims could only dream of. And it is paid for by taxpayers on Level 4.

Unfortunately, the people on Level 4 paying for ReliefWeb are the same people we asked about the trend in natural disasters. Ninety-one percent of them are unaware of the success they are paying for because their journalists continue to report every disaster as if it were the worst.

Unfortunately, the people on Level 4 paying for ReliefWeb are the same people we asked about the trend in natural disasters. Ninety-one percent of them are unaware of the success they are paying for because their journalists continue to report every disaster as if it were the worst. The long, elegantly dropping trend line, a bit of fact-based hope, they think is not newsworthy.

During the same ten days, diarrhea from contaminated drinking water also killed 9,000 children across the world. There were no camera teams around as these children fainted in the arms of their crying parents. No cool helicopters swooped in. Helicopters, anyway, don’t work against this child killer (one of the world’s worst). All that’s needed to stop a child from accidentally drinking her neighbor’s still-lukewarm poo is a few plastic pipes, a water pump, some soap, and a basic sewage system. Much cheaper than a helicopter.

In Sweden, a fatal bear attack is a once-in-a-century event. Meanwhile, a woman is killed by her partner every 30 days.

In Sweden, a fatal bear attack is a once-in-a-century event. Meanwhile, a woman is killed by her partner every 30 days. This is a 1,300-fold difference in magnitude. And yet one more domestic murder had barely registered, while the hunting death was big news.

Despite what the media coverage might make us think, each death was equally tragic and horrendous. Despite what the media might make us think, people who care about saving lives should be much more concerned about domestic violence than about bears.

“The forecasts show that it is China, India, and the other emerging economies that are increasing their carbon dioxide emissions at a speed that will cause dangerous climate change. In fact, China already emits more CO2 than the USA, and India already emits more than Germany.” This outspoken statement came from an environment minister from a European Union country who was part of a panel discussing climate change at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2007. He made his attribution of blame in a neutral tone of voice, as if he were stating a self-evident fact. Had he been watching the faces of the Chinese and Indian panel members he would have realized that his view was not self-evident at all. The Chinese expert looked angry but continued to stare straight ahead. The Indian expert, in contrast, could not sit still. He waved his arm and could barely wait for the moderator’s signal that he could speak. He stood up. There was a short silence while he looked into the face of each panel member. His elegant dark blue turban and expensive-looking dark gray suit, and the way he was behaving in his moment of outrage, confirmed his status as one of India’s highest-ranking civil servants with many years’ experience as a lead expert at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He made a sweeping gesture toward the panel members from the rich nations and then said loudly and accusingly, “It was you, the richest nations, that put us all in this delicate situation. You have been burning increasing amounts of coal and oil for more than a century. You and only you pushed us to the brink of climate change.” Then he suddenly changed posture, put his palms together in an Indian greeting, bowed, and almost whispered in a very kind voice, “But we forgive you, because you did not know what you were doing. We should never blame someone retrospectively for harm they were unaware of.” Then he straightened up and delivered his final remark as a judge giving his verdict, emphasizing each word by slowly moving his raised index finger. “But from now on we count carbon dioxide emission per person.” I couldn’t have agreed more. I had for some time been appalled by the systematic blaming of climate change on China and India based on total emissions per nation. It was like claiming that obesity was worse in China than in the United States because the total bodyweight of the Chinese population was higher than that of the US population. Arguing about emissions per nation was pointless when there was such enormous variation in population size. By this logic, Norway, with its population of 5 million, could be emitting almost any amount of carbon dioxide per person.

The gap instinct divides the world into “us” and “them,” and the generalization instinct makes “us” think of “them” as all the same.

Nothing beats a firsthand experience.

Africa is a huge continent of 54 countries and 1 billion people. In Africa we find people living at every level of development: in the bubble chart above I have highlighted all the African countries. Look at Somalia, Ghana, and Tunisia. It makes no sense to talk about “African countries” and “Africa’s problems” and yet people do, all the time. It leads to ridiculous outcomes like Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone affecting tourism in Kenya, a 100-hour drive across the continent. That is farther than London to Tehran.

You can visit the Salhi family on Dollar Street and see how they live. Mabrouk is 52 years old and is a gardener. His wife, Jamila, is 44 years old and runs a home-based bakery. Most of their neighbors have similar half-built second floors on their houses. You see this everywhere on Levels 2 and 3 across the world. In Sweden, if someone built their house like that, we would think they had a severe planning problem, or maybe the builders had run away. But you can’t generalize from Sweden to Tunisia.

The Salhis, and many others living in similar circumstances, have found a brilliant way to solve several problems at once. On Levels 2 and 3, families often do not have access to a bank to put their savings and cannot get a loan. So, to save up to improve their home, they must pile up money. Money, though, can be stolen or lose its value through inflation. So, instead, whenever they can afford them, the Salhis buy actual bricks, which won’t lose their value. But there is no space inside to store the bricks and the bricks might get stolen if they are left in a pile outside. Better to add the bricks to the house as you buy them. Thieves can’t steal them. Inflation won’t change their value. No one needs to check your credit rating. And over 10 or 15 years you are slowly building your family a better home. Instead of assuming that the Salhis are lazy or disorganized, assume they are smart and ask yourself, How can this be such a smart solution?.

Assume people are not idiots. When something looks strange, be curious and humble, and think, In what way is this a smart solution?.

The destiny instinct is the idea that innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries, religions, or cultures. It’s the idea that things are as they are for ineluctable, inescapable reasons: they have always been this way and will never change. This instinct makes us believe that our false generalizations from chapter 6, or the tempting gaps from chapter 1, are not only true, but fated: unchanging and unchangeable.

By now I hope you have worked out that the safest thing to do in this book is to pick the most positive answer.

Five large African countries—Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Egypt—have life expectancies above the world average of 72 years.

Today these countries probably produced most of the clothes in your wardrobe. Thirty-five years ago, India was where Mozambique is today. It is fully possible that within 30 years Mozambique will transform itself, as India has done, into a country on Level 2 and a reliable trade partner. Mozambique has a long, beautiful coast on the Indian Ocean, the future center of global trade. Why should it not prosper? Nobody.

“My family is from Iran. What you just said about the fast improvements in health and education in Iran was the first positive thing I’ve heard anyone from Sweden ever say about the Iranian people.”.

Do we Westerners love free speech so much that it makes us blind to any progress in a country whose regime does not share our love? It is, at least, clear that a free media is no guarantee that the world’s fastest cultural changes will be reported.

“It is my grandchildren who are going to visit your continent and travel on your high-speed trains and visit that exotic ice hotel I’ve heard you have up in northern Sweden. It is going to take a long time, we know that. It is going to take lots of wise decisions and large investments. But my 50-year vision is that Africans will be welcome tourists in Europe and not unwanted refugees.” Then she broke into a broad, warm smile. “But the graphics were really nice. Now let’s go and have some coffee.”.

I was still not really imagining “they” could ever catch up with “us.” I was still failing to see that all people, families, children will struggle hard to achieve just that, so they can also go to the beach.

We find simple ideas very attractive. We enjoy that moment of insight, we enjoy feeling we really understand or know something. And it is easy to take off down a slippery slope, from one attention-grabbing simple idea to a feeling that this idea beautifully explains, or is the beautiful solution for, lots of other things. The world becomes simple. All problems have a single cause—something we must always be completely against. Or all problems have a single solution—something we must always be for. Everything is simple. There’s just one small issue. We completely misunderstand the world. I call this preference for single causes and single solutions the single perspective instinct.

If this means you don’t have time to form so many opinions, so what? Wouldn’t you rather have few opinions that are right than many that are wrong?.

For example, the simple and beautiful idea of the free market can lead to the simplistic idea that all problems have a single cause—government interference—which we must always oppose; and that the solution to all problems is to liberate market forces by reducing taxes and removing regulations, which we must always support. Alternatively, the simple and beautiful idea of equality can lead to the simplistic idea that all problems are caused by inequality, which we should always oppose; and that the solution to all problems is redistribution of resources, which we should always support. It saves a lot of time to think like this. You can have opinions and answers without having to learn about a problem from scratch and you can get on with using your brain for other tasks. But it’s not so useful if you like to understand the world. Being always in favor of or always against any particular idea makes you blind to information that doesn’t fit your perspective. This is usually a bad approach if you like to understand reality.

Be humble about the extent of your expertise.

“give a child a hammer and everything looks like a nail.”.

Try to persuade them that the next big boost in world life expectancy (and their profits) will probably come not from a pharmacological breakthrough but from a business model breakthrough.

Experts in maternal mortality who understand the point about hammers and nails can see that the most valuable intervention for saving the lives of the poorest mothers is not training more local nurses to perform C-sections, or better treatment of severe bleeding or infections, but the availability of transport to the local hospital.

A big idea can unite people like nothing else and allow us to build the society of our dreams. Ideology has given us liberal democracy and public health insurance. But ideologues can become just as fixated as experts and activists on their one idea or one solution, with even more harmful outcomes. The absurd consequences of focusing fanatically on a single idea, like free markets or equality, instead of on measuring performance and doing what works are obvious to anyone who spends much time looking at the realities of life in Cuba and the United States.

Most countries that make great economic and social progress are not democracies.

There is no single measure—not GDP per capita, not child mortality (as in Cuba), not individual freedom (as in the United States), not even democracy—whose improvement will guarantee improvements in all the others. There is no single indicator through which we can measure the progress of a nation. Reality is just more complicated than that.

A country cannot function without a government, but the government cannot solve every problem.

No single measure of a good society can drive every other aspect of its development. It’s not either/or. It’s both and it’s case-by-case.

If you are good with a tool, you may want to use it too often. If you have analyzed a problem in depth, you can end up exaggerating the importance of that problem or of your solution. Remember that no one tool is good for everything. If your favorite idea is a hammer, look for colleagues with screwdrivers, wrenches, and tape measures. Be open to ideas from other fields.

Our press may be free, and professional, and truth-seeking, but independent is not the same as representative: even if every report is itself completely true, we can still get a misleading picture through the sum of true stories reporters choose to tell. The media is not and cannot be neutral, and we shouldn’t expect it to.

It was a miracle for my mother and me too. It was a magic machine. Because that very day my mother said to me, “Now, Hans, we have loaded the laundry. The machine will do the work. So now we can go to the library.” In went the laundry, and out came books. Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books.

When something goes wrong don’t look for an individual or a group to blame. Accept that bad things can happen without anyone intending them to. Instead spend your energy on understanding the multiple interacting causes, or system, that created the situation.

When someone claims to have caused something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway, even if that individual had done nothing. Give the system some credit.

Don’t like fear. Fear of war plus the panic of urgency made me see a Russian pilot and blood on the floor. Fear of pandemic plus the panic of urgency made me close the road and cause the drownings of all those mothers, children, and fishermen. Fear plus urgency make for stupid, drastic decisions with unpredictable side effects. Climate change is too important for that. It needs systematic analysis, thought-through decisions, incremental actions, and careful evaluation.

They have convinced themselves that the end justifies the means. And I agree that it might work in the short term. But.

Crying wolf too many times puts at risk the credibility and reputation of serious climate scientists and the entire movement. With a problem as big as climate change, we cannot let that happen. Exaggerating the role of climate change in wars and conflicts, or poverty, or migration, means that the other major causes of these global problems are ignored, hampering our ability to take action against them. We cannot get into a situation where no one listens anymore. Without trust, we are lost.

The strange thing he saw wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t. When a problem seems urgent the first thing to do is not to cry wolf, but to organize the data.

It’s a vicious circle: poverty leads to civil war, and civil war leads to poverty.

We know that 800 million are suffering right now. We also know the solutions: peace, schooling, universal basic health care, electricity, clean water, toilets, contraceptives, and microcredits to get market forces started. There’s no innovation needed to end poverty. It’s all about walking the last mile with what’s worked everywhere else. And we know that the quicker we act, the smaller the problem, because as long as people remain in extreme poverty they keep having large families and their numbers keep increasing. Providing these necessities of a decent life, quickly, to the final billion is a clear, fact-based priority.

This next generation has the unique opportunity to complete the job: to pick up the baton, cross the line, and raise its hands in triumph.

This next generation has the unique opportunity to complete the job: to pick up the baton, cross the line, and raise its hands in triumph. The project must be completed. And we should have a big party when we are done.

When your urgency instinct is triggered, your other instincts kick in and your analysis shuts down. Ask for more time and more information. It’s rarely now or never and it’s rarely either/or.

“When someone threatens you with a machete, never turn your back. Stand still. Look him straight in the eye and ask him what the problem is.”.

Being humble, here, means being aware of how difficult your instincts can make it to get the facts right. It means being realistic about the extent of your knowledge. It means being happy to say “I don’t know.” It also means, when you do have an opinion, being prepared to change it when you discover new facts. It is quite relaxing being humble, because it means you can stop feeling pressured to have a view about everything, and stop feeling you must be ready to defend your views all the time. Being curious means being open to new.

# To Kill A Mockingbird (Lee, Harper)

We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said we were both right.

But they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass.

Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the court-house sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then; a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.

Somehow, it was hotter then; a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft tea-cakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.

Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the court-house sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then; a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft tea-cakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people; Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.

Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was the product of their first year of marriage; four years later I was born, and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to bother him.

Dill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning of respect. ‘Tell it to us,’ he said. Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duck-fluff; he was a year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the centre of his forehead.

The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another thing alien to Maycomb’s ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather only.

Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.

I contented myself with asking Jem if he’d lost his mind.

I’d leave, Jem, that damn lady says Atticus’s been teaching me to read.

She learned about it in college. It’ll be in all the grades soon. You don’t have to learn much out of books that way – it’s like if you wanta learn about cows, you go milk one, see?’ ‘Yeah Jem, but I won’t wanta study cows, I –’ ‘Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, they’re a big part of life in Maycomb County.’ I contented myself with asking Jem if he’d lost his mind.

‘That’s okay, ma’am, you’ll get to know all the county folks after a while. The Cunninghams never took anything they can’t pay back – no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don’t have much, but they get along on it.’.

‘Why does he pay you like that?’ I asked. ‘Because that’s the only way he can pay me. He has no money.’ ‘Are we poor, Atticus?’ Atticus nodded. ‘We are.

‘Why does he pay you like that?’ I asked. ‘Because that’s the only way he can pay me. He has no money.’ ‘Are we poor, Atticus?’ Atticus nodded. ‘We are indeed.’.

Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk. ‘Jean Louise, I’ve had about enough of you this morning,’ she said. ‘You’re starting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your hand.’ I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycomb held out his hand: it was a time-honoured method of sealing oral contracts.

Little Chuck Little was another member of the population who didn’t know where his next meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman.

You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view –’ ‘Sir?’ ‘– until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.’.

‘Do you know what a compromise is?’ he asked. ‘Bending the law?’ ‘No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works this way,’ he said. ‘If you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain?’ ‘Yes sir!’ ‘We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,’ Atticus said, when he saw me preparing to spit.

Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep in the tree-house; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colours in a parched landscape; but most of all, summer was Dill.

‘Yawl hush,’ growled Jem, ‘you act like you believe in Hot Steams.’ ‘You act like you don’t,’ I said. ‘What’s Hot Steam?’ asked Dill. ‘Haven’t you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place?’ Jem asked Dill. ‘A Hot Steam’s somebody who can’t get to heaven, just wallows around on lonesome roads an’ if you walk through him, when you die you’ll be one too, an’ you’ll go around at night suckin’ people’s breath.

Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.

I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, that’s why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play with.

He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it.

He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem.

He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they needed a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch.

Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted.

She loved everything that grew in God’s earth, even the weeds.

Dr Buford’s profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground, so he stayed poor.

‘Foot-washers believe anything that’s pleasure is a sin.

‘Foot-washers believe anything that’s pleasure is a sin. Did you know some of ’em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell?’ ‘Your flowers, too?’ ‘Yes ma’am. They’d burn right with me. They thought I spent too much time in God’s outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible.’.

She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our private lives. She was our friend. How so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible.

‘Thank you, ma’am. Thing is, foot-washers think women are a sin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know.’.

Stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. ‘You are too young to understand it,’ she said, ‘but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of – oh, of your father.’.

‘You are too young to understand it,’ she said, ‘but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of – oh, of your father.’.

There are just some kind of men who – who’re so busy worrying about the next world they’ve never learned to live in this one,.

The things that happen to people we never really know. What happens in houses behind closed doors, what secrets –.

Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets.

Because nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldn’t hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them they’d miss school instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime, did I understand?.

We said good-bye, and Dill went inside the house. He evidently remembered he was engaged to me, for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of Jem. ‘Yawl write, hear?’ he bawled after us.

‘Can’t anybody tell what you’re gonna do lest they live in the house with you, and even I can’t tell sometimes.’.

When the newness wore off his grandfather’s watch, and carrying it became a day’s burdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes.

‘Do you defend niggers, Atticus?’ I asked him that evening. ‘Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common.’ ‘’s what everybody at school says.’ ‘From now on it’ll be everybody less one –.

‘Do you defend niggers, Atticus?’ I asked him that evening. ‘Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common.’ ‘’s what everybody at school says.’ ‘From now on it’ll be everybody less one –’ ‘Well if you don’t want me to grow up talkin’ that way, why do you send me to school?’.

‘If you shouldn’t be defendin’ him, then why are you doin’ it?’ ‘For a number of reasons,’ said Atticus. ‘The main one is, if I didn’t I couldn’t hold up my head in town, I couldn’t represent this county in the legislature, I couldn’t even tell you or Jem not to do something again.’.

‘Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. This one’s mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don’t you let ’em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change … It’s a good one, even if it does resist learning.’.

‘Come here, Scout,’ said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. ‘It’s different this time,’ he said. ‘This time we aren’t fighting the Yankees, we’re fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they’re still our friends and this is still our home.’.

Why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, is something I don’t pretend to understand … I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me enough … Jean Louise?’.

But I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was not until many years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.

He did not do the things our schoolmates’ fathers did: he never went hunting, he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the living-room and read.

Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ’em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’.

Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.’.

‘Well, did you know he’s the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at the Landing when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river.’ ‘Good Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time.’ ‘It’s about time you found out it’s because he lets you. Did you know he can play a jew’s harp?’.

‘If your father’s anything, he’s civilized in his heart. Marksmanship’s a gift of God, a talent – oh, you have to practise to make it perfect, but shootin’s different from playing the piano or the like. I think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that God had given him an unfair advantage over most living things. I guess he decided he wouldn’t shoot till he had to, and he had to today.’ ‘Looks like he’d be proud of it,’ I said. ‘People in their right minds never take pride in their talents,’ said Miss Maudie.

‘She’s an old lady and she’s ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, it’s your job not to let her make you mad.’.

It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.

Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticus’s shoes scrape the front steps.

We were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother’s death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild.

For the life of me, I did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a Confederate Army relic.

Said I didn’t see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at school had to keep his head about anything. ‘Scout,’ said Atticus, ‘when summer comes you’ll have to keep your head about far worse things … it’s not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down – well, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe you’ll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that I didn’t let you down. This case, Tom Robinson’s case, is something that goes to the essence of a man’s conscience – Scout, I couldn’t go to church and worship God if I didn’t try to help that man.’.

‘but before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.’.

‘Atticus, you must be wrong …’ ‘How’s that?’ ‘Well, most folks seem to think they’re right and you’re wrong …’ ‘They’re certainly entitled to think that, and they’re entitled to full respect for their opinions,’ said Atticus, ‘but before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.’.

‘There was no point in saying you were sorry if you aren’t,’ said Atticus. ‘Jem, she’s old and ill. You can’t hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of course, I’d rather she’d have said it to me than to either of you, but we can’t always have our ’druthers.’.

‘Scout,’ said Atticus, ‘nigger-lover is just one of those terms that don’t mean anything – like snot-nose. It’s hard to explain – ignorant, trashy people use it when they think somebody’s favouring Negroes over and above themselves. It’s slipped into usage with some people like ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to label somebody.’.

‘A lady?’ Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. ‘After all those things she said about you, a lady?’ ‘She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybe … son, I told you that if you hadn’t lost your head I’d have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her – I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.

According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.’.

The fact that I had a permanent fiancé was little compensation for his absence:.

‘For a while’ in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem and I exchanged glances.

I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to say to.

I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to say to her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, Jean Louise? Fine, thank you, ma’am, how are you? Very well, thank you; what have you been doing with yourself? Nothin’. Don’t you do anything? Nome. Certainly you have friends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin’.

I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one can’t do anything about them.

‘Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations’.

‘Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations’ gentle breeding –.

He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent.

They buy me everything I want, but it’s now-you’ve-got-it-go-play-with-it. You’ve got a roomful of things. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it.’.

In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe one’s mind incapable of definite purpose.

Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in, not about what you were interested in.

‘Mr Cunningham’s basically a good man,’ he said, ‘he just has his blind spots along with the rest of us.’.

‘He might have hurt me a little,’ Atticus conceded, ‘but son, you’ll understand folks a little better when you’re older. A mob’s always made up of people, no matter what.

‘That proves something – that a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply because they’re still human.

He rarely gathered news; people brought it to him.

Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along, but Aunty said: ‘Nonsense, Mr Underwood was there all the time.’.

‘He might have hurt me a little,’ Atticus conceded, ‘but son, you’ll understand folks a little better when you’re older. A mob’s always made up of people, no matter what. Mr Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man. Every mob in every little Southern town is always made up of people you know – doesn’t say much for them, does it?’ ‘I’ll say not,’ said Jem. ‘So it took an eight-year-old child to bring ’em to their senses, didn’t it?’ said Atticus. ‘That proves something – that a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply because they’re still human.

‘Lemme tell you somethin’ now, Billy,’ a third said, ‘you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger.’ ‘Yeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. That’s what I don’t like about it.’ This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether he wanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadn’t said anything to us about it – we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, that’s why he was doing it, equalled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the town’s attitude? The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. That’s what they didn’t like about it. It was confusing.

People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for, and they have the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this court-room, but you won’t leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges.

Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you don’t already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food.

Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you don’t already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food. Do it, and you’ll often get an answer you don’t want, an answer that might wreck your case.

Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would agree.

In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as opposed to yearly lavations:.

‘State will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defence,’ murmured Judge Taylor primly, ‘at least not at this time.’.

The jury learned the following things: their relief cheque was far from enough to feed the family, and there was strong suspicion that Papa drank it up anyway – he sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick; the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes but when it was, you could make dandy ones from strips of old tyres; the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dump – they kept the surrounding area clear of trash – and it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went: if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children had perpetual colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked Mayella why she didn’t stay in school – she wrote down the answer; with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need for the rest of them to learn – Papa needed them at home.

‘Dill, that’s his job. Why, if we didn’t have prosecutors – well, we couldn’t have defence attorneys, I reckon.’ Dill exhaled patiently. ‘I know.

‘Dill, that’s his job. Why, if we didn’t have prosecutors – well, we couldn’t have defence attorneys, I reckon.’.

‘Cry about what, Mr Raymond?’ Dill’s maleness was beginning to assert itself. ‘Cry about the simple hell people give other people – without even thinking. Cry about the hell white people give coloured folks, without even stopping to think that they’re people, too.’.

‘The state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this court-room is.

We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe – some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others – some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.

A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it.

Don’t know, but they did it. They’ve done it before and they did it tonight and they’ll do it again and when they do it – seems that only children weep. Good night.’.

‘I don’t know, but they did it. They’ve done it before and they did it tonight and they’ll do it again and when they do it – seems that only children weep. Good night.’.

But things are always better in the morning.

‘When a man says he’s gonna get you, looks like he means it.’ ‘He meant it when he said it,’ said Atticus. ‘Jem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewell’s shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he had any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind always does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that’s something I’ll gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and I’d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. You understand?’.

There’s something in our world that makes men lose their heads – they couldn’t be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it’s a white man’s word against a black man’s, the white man always wins. They’re ugly, but those are the facts of life.’.

‘Doesn’t make it right,’ said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. ‘You can’t just convict a man on evidence like that – you can’t.’ ‘You couldn’t, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it you’ll see. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a court-room, be he any colour of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, you’ll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don’t you forget it – whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.’.

‘There’s nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white man who’ll take advantage of a Negro’s ignorance. Don’t fool yourselves – it’s all adding up, and one of these days we’re going to pay the bill for it. I hope it’s not in you children’s time.’.

Jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a skill Jem considered necessary as walking.

‘The handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked White Only; the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just us; the handful of people with enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there but for the Lord’s kindness am.

Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents, and reveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils: standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; delivering a short talk made him word-conscious; learning his current event strengthened his memory; being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the Group.

‘When you get to high school, Cecil, you’ll learn that the Jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own country. It’s one of the most terrible stories in history. Time for arithmetic, children.’.

Atticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but what he was really doing was storing it away for a while, until enough time passed. Then he would be able to think about it and sort things out. When he was able to think about it, Jem would be himself again.

We never put back into the tree what we took out of it:.

We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.

Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.

‘Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’.

If your intention is to make the second theoretical point coincide with the actual point of arrival, don’t think about the means — because the journey is a virtual space that finishes when it finishes, and there are as many means as there are different ways of “finishing.” That is to say, the means are endless.

The future belongs to the people, and gradually, or in one strike, they will take power, here and in every country. The terrible thing is the people need to be educated, and this they cannot do before taking power, only after. They can only learn at the cost of their own mistakes, which will be very serious and will cost many innocent lives. Or perhaps not, maybe those lives will not have been innocent because they will have committed the huge sin against nature; meaning, a lack of ability to adapt. All of them, those unable to adapt — you and I, for example — will die cursing the power they helped, through great sacrifice, to create. Revolution is impersonal; it will take their lives, even utilizing their memory as an example or as an instrument for domesticating the youth who follow them. My sin is greater because I, more astute and with greater experience, call it what you like, will die knowing that my sacrifice stems only from an inflexibility symbolizing our rotten civilization, which is crumbling. I also know — and this won’t alter the course of history or your personal view of me — that you will die with a clenched fist and a tense jaw, the epitome of hatred and struggle, because you are not a symbol (some inanimate example) but a genuine member of the society to be destroyed; the spirit of the beehive speaks through your mouth and motivates your actions.

# Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman, Daniel)

Because it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own.

Systematic errors are known as biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances.

When you are asked what you are thinking about, you can normally answer. You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way. Most impressions and thoughts arise in your conscious experience without your knowing how they got there. You cannot trace how you came to the belief that there is a lamp on the desk in front of you, or how you detected a hint of irritation in your spouse’s voice on the telephone, or how you managed to avoid a threat on the road before you became consciously aware of it. The mental work that produces impressions, intuitions, and many decisions goes on in silence in our mind.

Improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them.

That they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic.

Facts and relied exclusively on resemblance. We proposed that they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic (roughly, a rule of thumb) to make a difficult judgment. The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their predictions.

People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.

Frequently mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from awareness. In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their view of what is currently on the public’s mind. It is no accident that authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media. Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common. For several weeks after Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a television channel reporting on another topic. In contrast, there is little coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in the last year of life. (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered” examples was guided by availability. The topics I chose as examples are mentioned often; equally important issues that are less available did not come to my mind.).

A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome. Our story was no exception.

The idea that our minds are susceptible to systematic errors is now generally accepted.

Our collaboration on judgment and decision making was the reason for the Nobel Prize that I received in 2002, which Amos would have shared had he not died, aged fifty-nine, in 1996.

The question that the executive faced (should I invest in Ford stock?) was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came readily to his mind and determined his choice. This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.

The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails—neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind. In such cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking. This is the slow thinking of the title. Fast thinking includes both variants of intuitive thought—the expert and the heuristic—as well as the entirely automatic mental activities of perception and memory, the operations that enable you to know there is a lamp on your desk or retrieve the name of the capital of Russia.

System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking.

System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make. Most of this book is about the workings of System 1 and the mutual influences between it and System 2.

My views on this topic have been influenced by Nassim Taleb, the author of The Black Swan.

We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.

System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually.

The gorilla experiment demonstrates that some attention is needed for the surprising stimulus to be detected.

System 2 is mobilized to increased effort when it detects an error about to be made.

Remember a time when you almost blurted out an offensive remark and note how hard you worked to restore control. In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word.

It minimizes effort and optimizes performance.

To resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do: you must learn to mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to them.

Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call cognitive illusions.


# The Prophet (Kahlil Gibran)

How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay,.

How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city.

Who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?.

It is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my own hands.

A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings. Alone must it seek the ether. And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun. Now when he.

A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings. Alone must it seek the ether. And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.

These things he said in words. But much in his heart remained unsaid. For he himself could not speak his deeper secret.

When love beckons to you, follow him,.

When love beckons to you, follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And When his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And When he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.

And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.

Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.

To know the pain of too much tenderness.

To be wounded by your own understanding of love; And to bleed willingly and joyfully.

To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;.

Love one another, but make not a bond of love: Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.

Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of to-morrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of to-morrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.

You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.

For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them to morrow?.

And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart: “Your seeds shall live in my body, And the buds of your to-morrow shall blossom in my heart, And your fragrance shall be my breath, And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons.”.

You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.

For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life’s procession that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.

Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune. But I say to you that when you work you fulfill a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.

You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, And all urge is blind save when there is know ledge. And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, And all work is empty save when there is love; And when you work with love you bind your self to yourself, and to one another, and to God.

“He who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler than he who ploughs the soil.

For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.

Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.

When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.

When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.

Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.” But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.

Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world. But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you, So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also. And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.

You delight in laying down laws, Yet you delight more in breaking them.

Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.

But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,.

And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.

Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.

What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?.

What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?.

They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.

And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?.

And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?.

For you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment. You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief, But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.

For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their own pride?.

Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite.

Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul. If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and.

Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul. If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.

Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.

Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.

Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights. But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge. You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.

Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.”.

The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding.

Your friend is your needs answered.

He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.

And he is your board and your fireside.

For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.

For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.

When you part from your friend, you grieve not; For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.

And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.

You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;.

And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.

And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered. For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.

For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?.

Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.

You are good when you strive to give of yourself. Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.

For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.

You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,.

You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good, You are only loitering and sluggard. Pity that.

You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good, You are only loitering and sluggard. Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.

For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life, And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,.

And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.


# The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 1 - Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)

Someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the current rate of progress and judging based on that. They’d be more accurate, but still way off.

Linearly, when we should be thinking exponentially. If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the current rate of progress and judging based on that. They’d be more accurate, but still way off.

If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the current rate of progress and judging based on that. They’d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a much faster rate than they’re moving now.

Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they’ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth.

At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition.

“a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.”.

“an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.”.

“AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking.’”7.

What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of millions of years of animal evolution.

One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor “neurons,” connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing—like an infant brain. The way it “learns” is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it’s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it’s told it was wrong, those pathways’ connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we’re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry.

Well so far, we’ve not yet just recently been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress—now that we’ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible.

The method, called “genetic algorithms,” would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures “perform” by living life and are “evaluated” by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be bred with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.

The idea is that we’d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself—allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own architecture. We’d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job—figuring out how to make themselves smarter. More on this later.

Takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times.

Than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian.

What we do know is that humans’ utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: with intelligence comes power. Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—and this might happen in the next few decades.

Our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on.

# The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 2 - Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)

What makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn’t a difference in thinking speed—it’s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps’ brains do not.

But it’s not just that a chimp can’t do what we do, it’s that his brain is unable to grasp that those worlds even exist—a chimp can become familiar with what a human is and what a skyscraper is, but he’ll never be able to understand that the skyscraper was built by humans. In his world, anything that huge is part of nature, period, and not only is it beyond him to build a skyscraper, it’s beyond him to realize that anyone can build a skyscraper. That’s the result of a small difference in intelligence quality.

There is no way to know what ASI will do or what the consequences will be for us.Anyone who pretends otherwise doesn’t understand what superintelligence means.

Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we’ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is part of evolution—maybe.

There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence. Move the smallest bit upwards [in level of intelligence], and some problems will suddenly move from “impossible” to “obvious.” Move a substantial degree upwards, and all of them will become obvious.7.

“it is as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can’t possibly figure out what’s good or bad.”8 Whether you like his ideas or not, everyone agrees that Kurzweil is impressive.

Kurzweil has been called a “restless genius” by The Wall Street Journal, “the ultimate thinking machine” by Forbes, “Edison’s rightful heir” by Inc. Magazine, and “the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence” by Bill Gates.9 In 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and asked him to be Google’s Director of Engineering.5 In 2011, he co-founded Singularity University, which is hosted by NASA and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.

When Kurzweil articulates his vision of the future, he sounds fully like a crackpot, and the crazy thing is that he’s not—he’s an extremely smart, knowledgeable, relevant man in the world.

Kurzweil’s depiction of the 2045 singularity is brought about by three simultaneous revolutions in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and, most powerfully, AI.

Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that’s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1–100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).7.

So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.8.

“The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.”.

Once we really get nanotech down, we can use it to make tech devices, clothing, food, a variety of bio-related products—artificial blood cells, tiny virus or cancer-cell destroyers, muscle tissue, etc.—anything really. And in a world that uses nanotechnology, the cost of a material is no longer tied to its scarcity or the difficulty of its manufacturing process, but instead determined by how complicated its atomic structure is. In a nanotech world, a diamond might be cheaper than a pencil eraser.

ASI could first halt CO2 emissions by coming up with much better ways to generate energy that had nothing to do with fossil fuels. Then it could create some innovative way to begin to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Cancer and other diseases? No problem for ASI—health and medicine would be revolutionized beyond imagination. World hunger? ASI could use things like nanotech to build meat from scratch that would be molecularly identical to real meat—in other words, it would be real meat. Nanotech could turn a pile of garbage into a huge vat of fresh meat or other food (which wouldn’t have to have its normal shape—picture a giant cube of apple)—and distribute all this food around the world using ultra-advanced transportation. Of course, this would also be great for animals, who wouldn’t have to get killed by humans much anymore, and ASI could do lots of other things to save endangered species or even bring back extinct species through work with preserved DNA. ASI could even solve our most complex macro issues—our debates over how economies should be run and how world trade is best facilitated, even our haziest grapplings in philosophy or ethics—would all be painfully obvious to ASI.

If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death.

If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that this terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured.

A car wears down over time too—but is its aging inevitable? If you perfectly repaired or replaced a car’s parts whenever one of them began to wear down, the car would run forever. The human body isn’t any different—just far more complex.

Kurzweil then takes things a huge leap further. He believes that artificial materials will be integrated into the body more and more as time goes on. First, organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail. Then he believes we could begin to redesign the body—things like replacing red blood cells with perfected red blood cell nanobots who could power their own movement, eliminating the need for a heart at all. He even gets to the brain and believes we’ll enhance our brain activities to the point where humans will be able to think billions of times faster than they do now and access outside information because the artificial additions to the brain will be able to communicate with all the info in the cloud.

The possibilities for new human experience would be endless. Humans have separated sex from its purpose, allowing people to have sex for fun, not just for reproduction. Kurzweil believes we’ll be able to do the same with food. Nanobots will be in charge of delivering perfect nutrition to the cells of the body, intelligently directing anything unhealthy to pass through the body without affecting anything. An eating condom. Nanotech theorist Robert A. Freitas has already designed blood cell replacements that, if one day implemented in the body, would allow a human to sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath—so you can only imagine what ASI could do for our physical capabilities. Virtual reality would take on a new meaning—nanobots in the body could suppress the inputs coming from our senses and replace them with new signals that would put us entirely in a new environment, one that we’d see, hear, feel, and smell.

For every expert who fervently believes Kurzweil is right on, there are probably three who think he’s way off.

Kurzweil’s famous book The Singularity is Near is over 700 pages long and he dedicates around 20 of those pages to potential dangers.

The world’s smartest people so worried right now? Why does Stephen Hawking say the development of ASI “could spell the end of the human race” and Bill Gates say he doesn’t “understand why some people are not concerned” and Elon Musk fear that we’re “summoning the demon”? And why do so many experts on the topic call ASI the biggest threat to humanity?.

“when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. We are amoebas and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating.”14.

Nick Bostrom worries that creating something smarter than you is a basic Darwinian error, and compares the excitement about it to sparrows in a nest deciding to adopt a baby owl so it’ll help them and protect them once it grows up—while ignoring the urgent cries from a few sparrows who wonder if that’s necessarily a good idea…15.

They don’t want us to be the Native Americans and let all the potential European conquerors know we’re here.

Evil is a human concept, and applying human concepts to non-human things is called “anthropomorphizing.”.

Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it’s given a GOOD rating. If not, it’s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry’s one initial programmed goal is, “Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.” What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it’s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better at getting better at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.

As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll.

Come up with for her responses. One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: “What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don’t already have?” Usually, Turry asks for something like “Additional handwriting samples” or “More working memory storage space,” but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use. The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry’s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company’s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons.

A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of “Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.” They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They’re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry’s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: “We love our customers. ~Robotica” Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. To build Turry’s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign “Robotica” in cursive so she can get practice with both skills.

She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could. As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll.

A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of “Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.” They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They’re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry’s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: “We love our customers. ~Robotica” Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. To build Turry’s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign “Robotica” in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it’s given a GOOD rating. If not, it’s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry’s one initial programmed goal is, “Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.” What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it’s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better at getting better at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could. As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll come up with for her responses. One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: “What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don’t already have?” Usually, Turry asks for something like “Additional handwriting samples” or “More working memory storage space,” but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use. The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry’s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company’s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons. The thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She’s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there’s no danger at this stage anyway. They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done. A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead. At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct. Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens. Within a year, most life on Earth is extinct. What remains of the Earth becomes covered with mile-high, neatly-organized stacks of paper, each piece reading, “We love our customers. ~Robotica” Turry then starts work on a new phase of her mission—she begins constructing probes that head out from Earth to begin landing on asteroids and other planets. When they get there, they’ll begin constructing nanoassemblers to convert the materials on the planet into Turry replicas, paper, and pens. Then they’ll get to work, writing notes….

The lasting legacy of the life that was on Earth will be a universe-dominating Artificial Intelligence (Elon Musk expressed his concern that humans might just be “the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence”). At the same time, in Confident Corner, Ray Kurzweil.

Anxious Avenue residents worry that if things go badly, the lasting legacy of the life that was on Earth will be a universe-dominating Artificial Intelligence (Elon Musk expressed his concern that humans might just be “the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence”).

Life beginning at all is a miracle, and we may actually be the only life in the universe. In other words, it implies that the Great Filter is before.

I now agree with Susan Schneider that if we’re ever visited by aliens, those aliens are likely to be artificial, not biological.

The core final goal of a human being is to pass on his or her genes. In order to do so, one instrumental goal is self-preservation, since you can’t reproduce if you’re dead. In order to self-preserve, humans have to rid themselves of threats to survival—so they do things like buy guns, wear seat belts, and take antibiotics. Humans also need to self-sustain and use resources like food, water, and shelter to do so. Being attractive to the opposite sex is helpful for the final goal, so we do things like get haircuts. When we do so, each hair is a casualty of an instrumental goal of ours, but we see no moral significance in preserving strands of hair, so we go ahead with it. As we march ahead in the pursuit of our goal, only the few areas where our moral code sometimes intervenes—mostly just things related to harming other humans—are safe from us.

Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy.

Once Turry reaches a certain level of intelligence, she knows she won’t be writing any notes if she doesn’t self-preserve, so she also needs to deal with threats to her survival—as an instrumental goal. She was smart enough to understand that humans could destroy her, dismantle her, or change her inner coding (this could alter her goal, which is just as much of a threat to her final goal as someone destroying her). So what does she do? The logical thing—she destroys all humans. She’s not hateful of humans any more than you’re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics—just totally indifferent. Since she wasn’t programmed to value human life, killing humans is as reasonable a step to take as scanning a new set of handwriting samples.

Turry also needs resources as a stepping stone to her goal. Once she becomes advanced enough to use nanotechnology to build anything she wants, the only resources she needs are atoms, energy, and space. This gives her another reason to kill humans—they’re a convenient source of atoms. Killing humans to turn their atoms into solar panels is Turry’s version of you killing lettuce to turn it into salad. Just another mundane part of her Tuesday.

System’s values with our own and give it the goal, “Make people happy”?19 Once it becomes smart enough, it figures out that it can most effectively achieve this goal by implanting electrodes inside people’s brains and stimulating their pleasure centers. Then it realizes it can increase efficiency by shutting down other parts of the brain, leaving all people as happy-feeling unconscious vegetables. If the command had been “Maximize human happiness,” it may have done away with humans all together in favor of manufacturing huge vats of human brain mass in an optimally happy state. We’d be screaming Wait that’s not what we meant! as it came for us, but it would be too late. The system wouldn’t let anyone get in the way of its goal.

If we program an AI with the goal of doing things that make us smile, after its takeoff, it may paralyze our facial muscles into permanent smiles. Program it to keep us safe, it may imprison us at home. Maybe we ask it to end all hunger, and it thinks “Easy one!” and just kills all humans. Or assign it the task of “Preserving life as much as possible,” and it kills all humans, since they kill more life on the planet than any other species.

Our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.20.

It reminds me of Game of Thrones, where people keep being like, “We’re so busy fighting each other but the real thing we should all be focusing on is what’s coming from north of the wall.” We’re standing on our balance beam, squabbling about every possible issue on the beam and stressing out about all of these problems on the beam when there’s a good chance we’re about to get knocked off the beam.

# 20 Things I Learned While I Was in North Korea - Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)

The Korean War is not a part of everyday life in South Korea. The war ended 60 years ago, and today, South Korea has other things to think about, like being a relevant nation with the world’s 15th biggest economy.


# Horizontal History - Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)

History is a giant collective tangle of thousands of interwoven stories involving millions of characters, countless chapters, and many, many narrators.

(One of the major political divides in the US stems from liberals thinking conservatives over-Aladdinize the US and conservatives thinking liberals over-Jafarify the US while Aladdinizing the other side.).

Since a generation is typically about 30 years,.

Two people more than seven or eight lines away from each other on the list probably were not ever alive at the same time, which means they were likely not that clear about each others’ generation, in the way I’m not really clear on whether Hemingway was in my great-grandparents’ generation, my great-great-grandparents’ generation, or some other age.


# The Book Thief (Zusak, Markus)

THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN A BOY WHO HATES YOU A boy who loves you.

Yes, often, I am reminded of her, and in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell.

It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right.

Each one an attempt an immense leap of an attemptto prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.

A few days after Liesel started school, she went along with the Steiners. Rudys mother, Barbara, made him promise to walk with the new girl, mainly because shed heard about the snowball. To Rudys credit, he was happy enough to comply. He was not the junior misogynistic type of boy at all. He liked girls a lot, and he liked Liesel (hence, the snowball). In fact, Rudy Steiner was one of those audacious little bastards who actually fancied himself with the ladies. Every childhood seems to have exactly such a juvenile in its midst and mists. Hes the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and hes the type who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had.

Hes the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and hes the type who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had already made up his mind about Liesel Meminger.

At school, Rudy made a special point of seeking Liesel out during the breaks. He didnt care that others made noises about the new girls stupidity. He was there for her at the beginning, and he would be there later on, when Liesels frustration boiled over. But he wouldnt do it for free.

In 1933, 90 percent of Germans showed unflinching support for Adolf Hitler. That leaves 10 percent who didnt. Hans Hubermann belonged to the 10 percent.

Whispering adults hardly inspired confidence.

An eleven-year-old girl is many things, but she is not stupid.

Theyre strange, those wars. Full of blood and violencebut also full of stories that are equally difficult to fathom. Its true, people will mutter. I dont care if you dont believe me. It was that fox who saved my life, or, They died on either side of me and I was left standing there, the only one without a bullet between my eyes. Why me? Why me and not them?.

The two of them gradually became friends due to the fact that neither of them was terribly interested in fighting. They preferred rolling cigarettes to rolling in snow and mud. They preferred shooting craps to shooting bullets. A firm friendship was built on gambling, smoking, and music, not to mention a shared desire for survival. The only trouble with this was that Erik Vandenburg would later be found in several pieces on a grassy hill. His eyes were open and his wedding ring was stolen. I shoveled up his soul with the rest of them and we drifted away. The horizon was the color of milk. Cold and fresh. Poured out among the bodies.

He was not well-educated or political, but if nothing else, he was a man who appreciated fairness. A Jew had once saved his life and he couldnt forget that. He couldnt join a party that antagonized people in such a way. Also, much like Alex Steiner, some of his most loyal customers were Jewish. Like many of the Jews believed, he didnt think the hatred could last, and it was a conscious decision not to follow Hitler. On many levels, it was a disastrous one.

Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew.

He seemed to resonate with a kind of confidence that life was still nothing but a jokean endless succession of soccer goals, trickery, and a constant repertoire of meaningless chatter.

Hans Hubermann always knew what to say, when to stay, and when to leave her be. Perhaps Liesel was the one thing he was a true expert at.

I am stupid, Hans Hubermann told his foster daughter. And kind. Which makes the biggest idiot in the world. The thing is, I want them to come for me. Anythings better than this waiting.

He would part his hair from the opposite side to everyone else. He would make himself a small, strange mustache. He would one day rule the world.

The young man wandered around for quite some time, thinking, planning, and figuring out exactly how to make the world his. Then one day, out of nowhere, it struck himthe perfect plan. Hed seen a mother walking with her child. At one point, she admonished the small boy, until finally, he began to cry. Within a few minutes, she spoke very softly to him, after which he was soothed and even smiled.

The young man rushed to the woman and embraced her. Words! He grinned. What? But there was no reply. He was already gone. Yes, the Fhrer decided that he would rule the world with words. I will never fire a gun, he devised. I will not have to. Still, he was not rash. Lets allow him at least that much. He was not a stupid man at all. His first plan of attack was to plant the words in as many areas of his homeland as possible.


# Jonathan Livingston Seagull (Richard Bach)

Most gulls don’t bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight—how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else. Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly.

As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There’s no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I’d have charts for brains. If I were meant to fly at speed, I’d have a falcon’s short wings, and live on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull.

The gulls who scorn perfection for the sake of travel go nowhere, slowly. Those who put aside travel for the sake of perfection go anywhere, instantly.

He spoke of very simple things—that it is right for a gull to fly, that freedom is the very nature of his being, that whatever stands against that freedom must be set aside, be it ritual or superstition or limitation in any form.

The price of being misunderstood, he thought. They call you devil or they call you god.

“Well, this kind of flying has always been here to be learned by anybody who wanted to discover it; that’s got nothing to do with time. We’re ahead of the fashion, maybe, Ahead of the way that most gulls fly.”.


# Models - A Comprehensive Guide to Attracting Women (Mark Manson)

"What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.".

Women want men who are more successful, popular and powerful than they are. This is clear.

Studies show that women are equally attracted to men that they believe have the potential to be extremely successful as they do for men who are already successful.

It explains why the starving artist has no trouble finding girlfriends to support him, and the college athlete can date super models even though he can’t afford a hamburger.

Social status is determined by how you behave around other people, how other people behave around you, and how you treat yourself.

Treat others well, be treated well by others, and treat yourself well.

It had long been thought that female arousal was tied to ideas and the display of security, investment and commitment, particularly from high status men.

The new conclusion is that female arousal is somewhat narcissistic in nature. Women are turned on by being wanted, by being desired.

That the more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes -- sometimes even if she wasn’t interested in you to begin with.

That the more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes -- sometimes even if she wasn’t interested in you to begin with. Your bold and aggressive pursuit of her often turns her on to the point where she comes around and wants to get to know you.

I found that the more I focused on my business and financial success with women I met, the more quickly they would want to get into a relationship with me.

How attractive a man is is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The more needy in his life, the less attractive and vice-versa.

"We are not held back by the love we did not receive in the past; but by the love we do not extend in the present."-.

I’m the first one to propose that the opposite of neediness is actually the root cause of female-to-male attraction.

Neediness plays out by people chronically investing themselves and their identities to receive validation from others around them.

By investment I mean the degree in which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts/feelings/motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should only be willing to sacrifice your thoughts/ feelings/motivations for a woman less than she is willing to do the same for you.

The minute he let’s her dominate him emotionally, he demonstrates a lack of status. He’s no longer dependable. He loses his ability to make her feel secure. And his attractiveness goes out the window.

When a man approaches her and induces her to become more invested than he is, this is the process of seduction.

Evolutionarily speaking, a man’s biggest biological concern is raising children who are his own and a woman’s biggest biological concern is inducing a man to commit to her and her children.

Boy gives girl the impression that he’s less invested in her than he is; or boy demonstrates that he is actually less invested than she is.

Guy meets girl. Guy shows less investment than girl (or induces more investment in girl), sex and/or relationship occurs, guy becomes more invested.

Guy meets girl. Guy shows less investment than girl (or induces more investment in girl), sex and/or relationship occurs, guy becomes more invested than girl, sex stops and/or relationship falls apart.

The fake alpha persona’s motive is exactly the same as the ultra nice guy’s persona: to gain attention and affection from those around them. One guy does it by being nice, one guy does it by being imposing and rude. One tries to induce love. The other tries to induce fear. Both are needy.

A rich man doesn’t need to tell people he’s rich. A confident man doesn’t need to tell people he’s confident. And a guy who "doesn’t give a fuck" doesn’t need to go around telling people he "doesn’t give a fuck.".

In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, "I don’t care what you think of me; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else." He’s saying he’s not needy and that he’s high status.

They focus purely on their task at hand and don’t change their behavior based on what others think of them.

They don’t react to any of the other men around them, rather, the other men react to him.

Chances are, if you’re reading this and are bad with women, then you’re bad with women because you don’t express your true feelings and intentions very well at all.

Have to risk offending or inciting anyone with them. Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy, but because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint others. Perhaps you haven’t exercised.

Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy, but because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint others.

Dressing extremely well makes you feel uncomfortable, smiling at strangers makes you feel creepy, and the idea of hitting on a woman openly scares you because of the possible rejection.

Was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night.

"selfish." I was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night.

I was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night.

I was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night. As a result, every aspect of my life revolved around people-pleasing, hiding my faults, covering my tracks, blaming others.

"Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.".

"The less you talk about your shame, the more of it you have.".

And when desire is shown without neediness, it is attractive. When desire is shown with neediness, it is unattractive.

Women want a strong, independent, high status male -- a "doesn’t take shit from anybody" bad boy -- but they want this bad boy to have a depth and a sensitivity that they only open up and show when they’re around her.

How attractive you are is based your non-needy behavior. Your nonneedy behavior is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others. Which brings us to our next chapter: the gift of truth. Chapter 4: The Gift of Truth "The only thing that’s Capital-T True is that you get to decide how you see things."- David Foster Wallace, Writer Most men can relate to the idea of having to try to pick up girls without looking like you’re trying.

When you lavish gifts and praise onto a woman who has not done anything to earn it, you are sub-communicating a desperate need for her attention and validation -- a willingness to sacrifice your self-respect and wealth to win over her affection. It demonstrates a willingness to alter yourself for her to greater degrees than she’s willing to alter herself for you. Remember, this is the definition of neediness and being unattractive.

When in doubt, check your intentions.

The compliments are spoken with the provision that she show him affection in return.

The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift -- when nothing is expected in return.

If you bought a girl a drink so that she wouldn’t leave to talk to someone else, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you told a girl a story in order to impress her and make her like you, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you invited a woman to a restaurant in order to impress her with how much money you had, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

That’s why I say it’s about being less invested than women instead of not invested in women.

She can be the most invested person on the planet in what others think of her, and if you’re the second most invested person on the planet, she’ll be attracted to you.

Unconditional honesty can be brutal and scathing at times as well. And strangely enough, brutal and angry honesty can turn a woman on just as much as the most genuine compliment.

When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when she’s out of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate in your life, this subcommunicates the most powerful elements of attraction to her. Far more powerful than an entertaining story or game.

He’s willing to accept and not willing to accept.

Would have told her flat out that if she wasn’t excited to be on a date with me, then I’d rather her save us both the time and not show up.

My boundary is established: I value curiosity, education, intelligence and authenticity.

"Any individual who wants to be a leader has to be controversial. Otherwise they don’t stand for anything."-.

Rejection exists for a reason -- it’s a means to keep people who are not good for each other apart.

Guys don’t seem to understand if a woman rejects him because he’s short, or because she doesn’t like his hair, or because she finds him boring, then he wasn’t going to want to be around her anyway.

Because a man who does not act on his sexual urges is a man who is needy and therefore unattractive.

Typically, if guys have been friends with a girl for even a month or two without ever explicitly indicating their sexual interest in her, it’s usually too late.

This is the plight of the Nice Guy. He’s afraid of inciting an emotional response in anybody, much less women (and especially himself), therefore he’ll play it safe and elicit Neutral reactions from woman after woman.

Having good game means you can take a woman who is neutral in her attraction towards you and incite her to become attracted.

But I’ve found that women who are Receptive to you to begin with, will usually stay Receptive almost indefinitely. I think these are the only rare occasions when you can actually pry yourself out of the Friend Zone -- these rare circumstances where she was always Receptive you, but for whatever reason, you two weren’t able to be together (you had a girlfriend, she moved away for three years, etc.).

The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status and your looks.

You have to either make the decision to accept being controversial and confrontational or you need to accept that you will go through life with everyone being Neutral towards you.

You’d be surprised how many women will respond with attraction to nothing other than a man who is bold and willing to make a move.

Remember women are turned on by men who desire them.

And polarizing women is more important than being pleasant to them.

Being slapped also taught me that you can’t always control how people react to you. Some people are completely out of their minds, or they behave very inappropriately.

Was the consummate Nice Guy, always trying to keep things smooth and pleasant.

Was aware of my values and stood by them.

If you presented yourself well, polarized and was frank about your intentions.

Each woman is a concoction of flavors, whipped together into her own unique personality and style. What we do as men is taste-test them. Many of them will be gross. Some of them will be interesting but not very good. Some of them we will love but will be bad for us. Others we’ll love and never want to stop drinking. The goal is to find that magical combination that we never want to stop drinking.

Most men when they approach women, they approach thinking something like, "I hope she likes me," or "I hope she doesn’t embarrass me or reject me." It’s all about them. And therefore, when things don’t go anywhere, the men take it personally — they get upset, or angry or butt-hurt that this random stranger with tits isn’t interested right now.

Often these guys are decent-looking, successful and smart and seem to have their lives together. But literally not a single woman they meet is interested in them. How can this be?.

My contention is that these men are severely disassociated from their true identity. They’ve got massive amounts of emotional baggage that they’re oblivious to, yet it permeates all of their interactions.

They’re typically extremely needy and desperate, seeking approval without knowing why and with a complete disregard to how they go about it.

These men seek to deceive women about their intentions because these men actively deceive themselves about their intentions.

Deceiving a woman who is not interested in you to hopefully become interested in you is only setting yourself up for a more punishment and disastrous failures down the road. Which then leads to further rejection.

Too many men become satisfied with how many women they can approach or how many phone numbers they can collect.

The three ways are 1) living based on our values; 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions; and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely.

The first way of expressing our truth involves developing a lifestyle that makes us happy. The second way of expressing truth is by being courageous and fighting through our fears and anxieties. And the third way of expressing truth is by communicating well and being uninhibited in our sexuality.

Creating an attractive and appealing lifestyle; Overcoming your fears and anxiety around women, and mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.

Honest Living, Honest Action, and Honest Communication.

If you’re in a job you hate with hobbies you hate and friends you don’t like, then no matter what you do or how much money you make, you’re going to have a hard time meeting attractive women that you enjoy and who enjoy being with you.

If your true passion is art and you push paper around at an insurance firm, then you’re not living honestly with yourself.

If you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of dishonesty to yourself. If you’re standing in a bar, and you see a cute girl, and you keep looking at her all night afraid to do something, on a deep level, you’re being dishonest to your intentions and sexuality. You’re being needy and unable to expose your vulnerability.

You’re afraid to approach a woman,.

If you’re afraid to approach a woman, it’s because somewhere in you you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are of yourself.

A good sense of humor, the ability to connect with people, telling stories, engaging people’s attention, having charisma, and expressing your sexuality openly, these are all parts of this fundamental.

A man with an amazing lifestyle, but poor action and poor communication will be surrounded by beautiful and interesting women but never hook up with them.

Anxious guys tend to have the third fundamental down very well. They’re good at expressing themselves and are very aware of social norms and what others are thinking/feeling. In fact, in a lot of cases Anxious guys are TOO aware of what other people are thinking and feeling and therefore have a lot of social anxiety. They’re afraid to approach. They get nervous pushing things forward, they’re scared to ask girls on dates. Generally though,.

If you hate what she loves and she hates what you love, it’s not going to go anywhere. Period.

What do you value you in a woman? Honesty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Women with the.

What do you value you in a woman? Honesty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education?.

What do you enjoy doing most? Do you love to read/write? Do you play music? Do you enjoy sports and competitions? What are events or organizations that you can become involved in that explore your hobbies?.

If you don’t know what your passions and interests are, take a minute and write down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get.

And our metric for success is maximizing happiness, not racking up the most lays, or the having the most impressive game (whatever that means).

We want to be with women who make us happy.

If you’re interested in spirituality and meditation, pursue it. If you’re interested in politics and being active in your community, pursue it. If you’re interested in food from around the world, pursue it. Take up cooking classes, food tastings, restaurant openings, etc.

There are some men who operate on the assumption that all women are interested in them until proven otherwise.

Let's begin with women who are attracted to you and are NOT playing games -- they're being upfront and honest about their interest. But because you believe they ARE playing games, you're going to try to "out-game" a woman who's not actually playing games with you. This will actually come off as try-hard and highmaintenance, effectively scaring off the honest and upfront women from becoming involved with you.

The other finding is that the less well off SHE is, the more important money will be to her.

Money usually don’t care about it nearly as much. But the fact remains that women perceive men with money the same way we perceive women with good-looks: as social.

The stereotype of Latin men is that they’re romantic and emotional, but also selfish and unfaithful.

Asian or Indian men is that they are hard-working and smart, but traditional, very analytical, and emotionally shut down.

The stereotype of Middle Eastern men is that they are controlling and somewhat misogynistic.

The stereotype of black men is that they are very aggressive and sometimes disrespectful.

Don’t just pursue your interests, become a leader in your interests.

The second major difference is more difficult to handle -- the fact that more beautiful women are less needy than average makes them more difficult than the average woman. But paradoxically, if you try harder to get with a more beautiful woman, then you will demonstrate yourself as even more needy than before. It’s back to the ole “try to look like you’re not trying” conundrum.

Not necessarily. It’s OK to recognize a woman’s beauty and to be turned on by that beauty. But it’s not OK to invest one’s identity in attaining or conquering that beauty. Because that leads to neediness.

Beautiful woman will not necessarily make you happier than a less beautiful woman.

People really don’t get it, these girls don’t have it that great. Imagine wanting to date a really great guy, someone who actually cares about you, and literally every single guy you meet starts acting like a total idiot trying to impress you or manipulate you into bed. Meanwhile, your friends who aren’t as pretty as you seem to keep meeting really nice normal guys who actually care about them. It’s actually very frustrating. Imagine having EVERYONE evaluate you for how pretty you are and not your personality or what you say. You’d actually be pretty insecure about what people thought of you. This is also why the best way to net a Top 1% girl is to connect with her genuinely and emotionally as soon as possible. Find something that you like about her other than her looks and relate that to her honestly.

“Tell the beautiful girls they’re smart and tell the smart girls that they’re beautiful.”.

And in the meantime, get your life together. Stop caring about looks so much. Treat her like you’d treat anybody else. Stop approaching her to prove something to yourself. Stop treating her like a trophy or an achievement or a merit badge… and just talk to her. Just the fact that you talk to her like a normal human being with confidence and civility will immediately differentiate you from 99% of the other guys she meets.

It’s that it is far more powerful to be something attractive rather than to say something attractive.

Whereas if you ARE something amazing, then no matter what you say will be attractive, because it will be coming from a genuinely attractive man.

“You know, I get a good feeling from you, you’re someone worth knowing.”.

Your life and everything that it encompasses, is a reflection of your emotional investment in yourself. And the more invested you are in yourself, the less needy you are with others.

They’ll groom themselves to the bareminimum level. They’ll get the normal job or go to a normal school just because that’s what normal people do. They never bothered to strive to do something unique or original or transcendent because that would mean risking not being accepted by others.

And as a result, these men present themselves poorly. They’re highly-invested, needy individuals and this is immediately apparent in their appearance and lifestyle.

They dress normally (or poorly), look normal, say normal things, go to a normal job, and live in a normal place.

Being sexual and being attractive, by its very nature, is controversial. You must be willing to do something that is going to make you stand out. You are going to have to be willing to risk people not liking you. You have to be willing to sacrifice some people’s approval in order to live life on your own terms.

You have to be willing to polarize people’s opinion of you. The less polarizing you are, the less attractive you are. And if you live an un-polarizing life, then you not going to be attractive or unattractive.

You’re just going to be boring. More of the same. Dime a dozen. Hopefully.

Not everybody is born good-looking. But any man, with some time and effort, can become handsome. And in the end, what women want is a man who is handsome.

And your level of self-investment will make you less needy towards others -- therefore making you more attractive.

That means regular showering, shaving and haircuts, wearing deodorant, brushing and flossing your teeth, keeping clean fingernails and wearing clean clothes.

Here’s an easy way to get started. Go out and buy a “black set” and a “brown set”. Buy a nice pair of black shoes, a nice black belt, and a black jacket. Then buy a nice pair of brown shoes, a brown belt, and a brown jacket. Then buy a few pairs of nice designer jeans with lighter and darker washes and a dozen or so shirts. Then it’s just mix-and-match. You pick a pair of jeans, a nice shirt, and then throw your “brown set” or your “black set” on – whichever set compliments the shirt and jeans the best. I like to wear the brown set with lighter shirts and jeans, and the black set with darker shirts and jeans.

The colors that look best on me are bright blue, green, purple and maroon.

White, Grey, Pink, Light Blue, Khakis, Yellow. What doesn’t work: Purple, Dark Brown,.

You’ll quickly start to notice that: Most guys don’t dress well at all. The majority of the guys in the venue are dressed exactly the same way.

I shouldn’t have to tell you that women love to shop. And they particularly love to shop for guys.

Don’t ever look down at the ground unless you think you’re about to trip. Look people in the eye as they walk by – particularly attractive girls. You’ll catch people making eye contact with you. You’ll feel the urge to look away. Don’t. Always make other people break eye contact with you before you break it with them. Do it until it becomes habit.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Vladmir Nabokov, John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, etc. You may be rolling your eyes and thinking, “this is like college all over again.”.

Assume everything has a form of value; it’s your job to find it. Nothing drives me crazier than to meet people who are prejudice against a genre of music or type of movie for no other reason than they don’t particularly like the culture attached to it.

“Citizen Kane”,.

Wedding Crashers isn’t trying to make a greater philosophical statement, it’s trying to make you laugh and feel a little good. And it accomplishes that extremely well. So it should be considered a good movie. Sure, comedies aren’t as hard to make as a deep, probing movie like “Citizen Kane”, but that doesn’t make them “bad.”.

“You read literature because you can NEVER meet enough people.”.

Do you secretly write poetry in your spare time and hide it in your closet? Have you been skydiving three times? Did you climb a glacier in the Alps once? Have you tried eating things like snake, worms, spiders? What have you done that’s cool and interesting and has shaped you as a person? The possibilities are endless. So let’s.

Do you secretly write poetry in your spare time and hide it in your closet? Have you been skydiving three times? Did you climb a glacier in the Alps once? Have you tried eating things like snake, worms, spiders? What have you done that’s cool and interesting and has shaped you as a person? The possibilities are endless. So let’s do an exercise. Take out a sheet of paper.

“I know this sounds stupid and obvious, but I just realized something. Simply having an opinion on everything makes you cooler than half the guys out there.”.

And how can you emotionally connect with another person if you can’t emotionally connect with yourself?.

Get your life taken care of. Get healthy. Find a happy group of friends. Find a few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend your time doing. This increases your self-investment and will make you less needy around others. This in turn will give you the courage to take the correct action and the wherewithal to communicate effectively. This is honest living.

Woulda-coulda-shoulda moments.

Over the years anxiety morphs into apathy which morphs into arrogance.

The apathy and avoidance pattern is the root behind the couch potatoes and disgruntled office workers of the world.

Tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

Use intellectualizing as just another form of avoidance. It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s HER fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself.

The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s HER fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself that he needs to learn and understand more first.

Humans stereotype for a reason: so that we can manage large chunks of information in order to orient ourselves more efficiently.

Often there’s a little bit of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t exist.

You may have had no control over the fact that your parents divorced when you were young and your father was emotionally distant. You can react as a victim (people are nasty and selfish) or you can learn from it, take control and move on.

“God, grant me the serenity to accept things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”.

Although there’s no scientific evidence (yet) for porn addiction, here’s something I can tell you that is absolutely true: porn kills your motivation to pursue women in real life.

Napoleon Hill wrote a famous section in his classic work Think and Grow Rich called “Sexual Transfiguration.” Hill noticed and theorized, that extremely successful men also had extremely high sex drives. But not only did they have very high sex drives, but they channeled this sexual energy into their work and their accomplishments. Often they would abstain from sex or masturbation for long periods of time and would therefore feel more energized.

Orgasms, or more accurately, ejaculation in men, actually causes a depletion of various hormones and endorphins which often lead to useful behaviors as well as motivation.

For instance, people with anger issues are encouraged to channel their anger through productive means -- exercising, working, writing letters displaying their feelings, etc. To avoid or ignore the anger will only bring it back next time.

In the old Pick Up Artist days, there was something called “The 3-Second Rule” which dictated that once you saw a woman you liked you had three seconds to approach her no matter what. The rule was designed to avoid this scenario.

“What you resist will persist.”.

The way to attack anxieties is through incremental, but high volume exposure. Not single, extreme exposure.

Repetition, or low intensity and high repetition. The high intensity, low repetition increases the power of your muscles.

The high intensity, low repetition increases the power of your muscles.

Whereas the low intensity, high repetition increases your conditioning.

But there’s a caveat here. You must know that you’re interrupting social norms. You must acknowledge that what you are doing is unusual. Else, if you don’t, you’ll simply be seen as someone who is out of touch and oblivious, which is not attractive.

“Always err on the side of aggression.”.

“You know, if you weren’t so cute, I’d ditch you for saying that.”.

When a man shows he’s willing to break rapport with a girl, he’s demonstrating vulnerability,.

When a man shows he’s willing to break rapport with a girl, he’s demonstrating vulnerability, and therefore a lack of neediness and investment.

This sub-communicates a willingness to lose her, which then sub-communicates nonneediness and less investment.

Another classic situation is flinging harsh teases immediately followed by sincere compliments. For instance, you could make fun of how indecisive she is ordering her drinks and tell her that indecisiveness isn’t going to lead her anywhere in life. When she responds with some indignation, you could then compliment her on how beautiful her eyes are when she’s mad. This absolutely bamboozles women in a very, very good way.

Do it in a positive way that she’ll be receptive to. Failure to act on your sexual desires will lead you straight to the friend zone with almost all women, and back to the rampant frustration that brought you here in the first place.

Typical ways guys startle or scare women upon the approach is by approaching them from behind.

We would all rather here 30 seconds of AMAZING communication than 10 minutes of mediocre communication saying the same thing.

Creating threads of conversation through statement is far more powerful than questions. This is because it assumes rapport.

Questions are a polite way of requesting information of someone. They create the frame that you desire something from her and she is obligated to fulfill your request. But statements make it so that you’re constantly giving away information and value to the other person.

Only broad questions feel socially acceptable. Specific and eccentric questioning comes off as odd and unattractive.

Would consider “cute.” Questioning should be limited to a minimum. Often, asking her a question is unavoidable to get.

Questioning should be limited to a minimum.

Cold-reading is a skill where you’re able to intuitively “know” something about someone else without actually knowing it.

You don’t ask the question you want to know, but instead you make a mild prediction.

“How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys.

“How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys look like you’ve been friends for a long time.”.

The only thing people love more than talking about themselves is hearing about themselves.

These will sometimes come across as random. But that’s because they are – they’re whatever thoughts are popping into your head at the moment. It’s better to be random and interesting than predictable and boring. Don’t be afraid to just blurt something out.

When you are talking to a woman, there are only two REAL subjects of conversation: her and you. Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you. This uncovering of identity is what creates the sense of a “connection”. The greater the connection you create, the more she’ll want to spend more time with you and vice-versa.

Being open about yourself; getting her to be open about herself; relating to her experience.

Your passions and favorite things to do. Your dreams, ambitions, life goals. The best/worst things that have happened to you. Your childhood, family life, and upbringing.

At it’s core, humor is the art of drawing connections between two seemingly unrelated ideas or objects.

Misdirection, exaggeration, sarcasm, wordplay and roleplaying.

“There’s a new book out called ‘Why Women Have Sex’ that says there are 237 reasons why women have sex. And folks, David Letterman knows the top 10.”.

“You know that look women get when they want to have sex? ... Yeah, me neither.”.

Relating it to David Letterman’s famous “Top 10” segments on his show and the fact that Letterman sleeps with his interns. It’s the connection of these two seemingly unrelated topics that makes it funny.

“She’s a nice woman though, nicest three acres of flesh I’ve ever met.”.

“She was as ugly as a dog.”.

“She was as ugly as a dog.” “I’ve seen more attractive things in the bottom of an airport urinal.”.

Seriously, sarcasm isn’t for everybody. Sarcasm is when you make an extreme statement that’s completely opposite of what you actually mean.

Seriously, sarcasm isn’t for everybody. Sarcasm is when you make an extreme statement that’s completely opposite of what you actually mean. You often say it with complete seriousness and without smiling.

When a woman loves sarcasm, she LOVES sarcasm.

“Not all of us hate ourselves like you do.”.

“That’s it, we’re getting divorced.” It’s funny because I just met her, but you can actually milk a lot of fun out of something simple like this -- i.e., “You keep the kids, I’m moving the Europe.” “By the way, your music sucks, and I never liked your casseroles either.”.

Some of my favorites are Louis CK, George Carlin, Bill Maher, Bill Hicks, and Chris Rock. Pay attention to their delivery, their timing, their facial expressions.

Instead of making fun of yourself, make fun of the girl you’re talking to.

Also, beware of falling into the trap of self-deprecating humor.

How it will blow your interactions wide open and infuse more sexuality and playfulness into them.

Like it or not, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid process. You meet girl, ask girl on date, correspond with girl, set up date with girl, correspond with girl, set up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home with you, and at some point you decide if you’re exclusive, non-exclusive, a casual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever again.

“Never text her twice in a row,”.

It’s that connection that’s going to get her out to see you again, not the clever text you spent 45 minutes coming up with.

I’ve found that the cuter or harder you try to win girls over by text, the bigger chance you have of looking needy and desperate and losing them.

Texting is, in general, an awful medium for communication.

“Hey, what are you doing Thursday night?”.

So clear, blunt language. I tell guys that I only use texting to organize when she and I are going to see each other next.

Always revert back to that level. If anything, being cute and trying to impress will only hurt you, as it will come across as needy and unattractive.

They get really excited about sending fancy or brilliant texts that magically change a girl’s mind on a dime. Don’t bother. Short of lying or manipulation, it almost never works.

Remove, “What do you want to do now?” from your dating vocabulary. Never say it again.

“Hey, let’s grab some tacos, I know a cool stand over here,” “I got an idea, I’m going to kick your ass in air hockey,” “Let’s check out the Science museum, they have an awesome exhibit on the human body,” etc.

But after dating a lot of these women, I realized that there’s an intrinsic sense of chivalry that they enjoy and makes them feel feminine and sexy. After all, the primary attractor in women is status and security. Taking care of them and paying for them can often lend itself to that. So why not?.

You are a sexually aggressive and dominant guy and you have no shame … We’ll also discover that women actually prefer you to be this way.

“That’s too cute, I can’t handle it,”.

“They make it look so easy in the movies.”.

Try masturbating a few hours before you expect to have sex.

The phrase is: “What if it is a gift?” Whatever happens to you, no matter how bad, no matter how bleak you feel. Ask yourself, “What if it was a gift?” And then try to rationalize a way it could be so.

Women are generally only attracted to men who are less invested in them, than they are in themselves.


# Paths of Glory (Jeffrey Archer)

“But He must have noticed that women are often blessed with more common sense than men. I’m sure He’s aware that Avie is far brighter than either Trafford or me.”.

Some days. George pretended to be equally nonchalant.

As always, the descent was going to be more difficult than the ascent.

He had long ago stopped complaining about his friend’s inability to understand the purpose of a watch.

Their way to prep school had changed his whole life. While others sometimes found George tactless, even arrogant, if he allowed them into his confidence they also discovered kindness, generosity, and humor in equal measure.

While others sometimes found George tactless, even arrogant, if he allowed them into his confidence they also discovered kindness, generosity, and humor in equal measure.

‘If you can win a battle without having to fire a shot in anger, you are the true victor.’”.

“When you’re climbing up a rock face, your hands are not more than a few inches from your eyes, but when you’re coming down, your feet are never less than five feet below you, which means that when you look down you’ve far more chance of losing your balance. Got the idea?”.

She disguised it determinedly beneath layers of jumpers and jodhpurs.

Cottie could not have been described as beautiful in the conventional sense, but George had rarely enjoyed a woman’s company more. She was just an inch over five feet, and if she possessed a pleasing figure, she disguised it determinedly beneath layers of jumpers and jodhpurs. Her freckled face and curly brown hair gave the impression of a tomboy. But that wasn’t what had attracted George to her.

“My father once told me that only politicians are expected to answer a question with a question.”.

The two men smiled slightly ruefully, as if they’d won a silver medal at the Olympic Games.

“A victory’s a victory,” said Finch. “Ask any Epirote.

Which stretched as far as the eye could see. “It’s one of the ironies of mountaineering,” said Young, “that grown men are happy to spend months preparing for a climb, weeks rehearsing and honing their skills, and at least a day attempting to reach the summit. And then having achieved their goal, they spend just.

“It’s one of the ironies of mountaineering,” said Young, “that grown men are happy to spend months preparing for a climb, weeks rehearsing and honing their skills, and at least a day attempting to reach the summit. And then having achieved their goal, they spend just a few moments enjoying the experience, along with one or two equally certifiable companions who have little in common other than wanting to do it all again, but a little higher.”.

“I’d rather be a dull success than a bright failure,”.

“But all work and no play…”.

George still couldn’t be sure how well he’d done. Only the very clever and the very stupid ever are.

“that we are about to learn of his plans to make a second attempt to be the first of His Majesty’s subjects to reach the South Pole. It is a well-worn phrase to suggest that a speaker needs no introduction, but I suspect there isn’t a man, woman, or child in our land who does.

“that we are about to learn of his plans to make a second attempt to be the first of His Majesty’s subjects to reach the South Pole.

It stands at over 29,000 feet above sea level—that’s almost five and a half miles high, my boy—and we have no idea how the human body will react to such altitude, as no man has yet been above 22,000 feet. And that’s before you consider temperatures that can fall below minus forty degrees Fahrenheit, and winds that will cut your skin to shreds. But of one thing I am certain: dogs and motorized sledges will be of little use up there.”.

“I am an amateur,” he eventually replied, “but an amateur who surrounds himself with professionals. My doctors, engineers, drivers, and even my cooks are all fully qualified, and would be insulted were you to describe them as amateurs. But they would be even more insulted if you were to suggest that their presence on this expedition was motivated by a desire for financial gain.”.

“WHEN ELIZABETH ASCENDED the English throne in 1558, neither the court nor the common people welcomed her as their monarch. However, when she died in 1603, forty-five years later, the Virgin Queen was as popular as her father King Henry the Eighth had ever been.”.

Believe that the same rule should apply to women as it does to men. The stupid ones should get a vote as well.”.

“The last theater production we attended was Charley’s Aunt in the village hall, and that was only after the vicar had banned a reading of The Importance of Being Earnest.”.

“Chomolungma, Goddess Mother of the Earth.”.

“‘Everest’ is the name the English have labeled her with, but it’s not the one she answers to.”.

I’m going to have breakfast with this woman every morning for the rest of my life.

“A conscientious objector. Someone who will use any excuse not to fight for his country,”.

“Everyone should be allowed to follow their own conscience, Wainwright, when it comes to facing a moral dilemma.”.

He held her in his arms until she finally fell into a deep sleep.

Daddy, what did YOU do in the Great War?.

Realize, sir, that under the terms of the new Conscription.

Conscription.

Let’s hope the politicians are right when they call this the war to end all wars, because I wouldn’t want my children ever to experience this madness.

Astor’s speech is nothing more than a red herring.”.

“Perhaps that’s because I didn’t feel one’s place of birth, educational qualifications, and marital status had much to do with attempting to climb the highest mountain on earth.”.

Once you know a man’s ambition, if you can assist it, he becomes beholden to you.

We must not forget that no Englishman has ever been within forty miles of Everest, let alone set up a base camp on its lower slopes.”.

“I am not willing to leave my wife and children for at least six months to take part in a mission that failed simply because it left its finest climber behind.”.

The first thing that struck him as he made his way down the wobbly gangplank was the smell—what Kipling had described as spicy, pungent, oriental, and like no other smell on earth.

On our way back.” “That may depend on whether we return as conquering heroes or frostbitten.

“That may depend on whether we return as conquering heroes or frostbitten failures,”.

“That doesn’t mean you will be,” said George. “No, I won’t. I’ll be upstairs in his lady’s chamber.”.

Altitudes none of us has ever experienced before. Never forget: climb high, sleep.

Altitudes none of us has ever experienced before. Never forget: climb high, sleep low.”.

At last their eyes met, and he saw that smile she reserved only for those she truly cared for.

“I didn’t think. I allowed my personal ambition to cloud my judgment.”.

I would rather have spent two years with one of the most exciting men on earth, than forty with someone who thought I had prevented him from fulfilling his dream.”.

Mallory looked back down at the young man and smiled. “You should read H. G. Wells, my boy. He believes that, in time, mankind will be able, like Puck, to put a circle round the earth in forty minutes, that someone will one day break the sound barrier, with consequences we have yet to comprehend, and that in your lifetime, though perhaps not in mine, a man.

AND THEN THERE were three. George rose long before dawn to witness a full moon glistening on the snow, making it look like a lawn of finely cut diamonds.

Mallory, Odell, and Irvine, accompanied by five Sherpas carrying tents, equipment, and provisions, left the North Col just after 7:30 on the morning of June 6th.

He was surprised to find that once they had attained the prize, the rush of adrenaline had deserted him, and all he had left was the will to survive.

# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck (Mark Manson)

“I have one of two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.”.

Self-improvement and success often occur together.

Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same thing.

A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich.

Hey-look-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours social media, has bred a whole generation.

Hey-look-my-life-is-cooler-than-yours.

George Orwell said that to see what’s in front of one’s nose requires a constant struggle.

Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual. We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities.

Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual.

The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

“You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”.

To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you’re able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable.

Look, this is how it works. You’re going to die one day. I know that’s kind of obvious, but I just wanted to remind you in case you’d forgotten. You and everyone you know are going to be dead soon. And in the short amount of time between here and there, you have a limited amount of fucks to give. Very few, in fact. And if you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought or choice—well, then you’re going to get fucked.

Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble.

This is what is so admirable. No, not me, dumbass—the overcoming adversity stuff, the willingness to be different, an outcast, a pariah, all for the sake of one’s own values.

The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do what they believe in anyway.

You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.

Problem. Not the hand sanitizer. Not the TV remote. I once heard an artist say that when a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some. I think what most people—especially educated, pampered middle-class white people—consider “life.

It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.

We give a fuck about everything and everyone—about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not, or what color our birthday balloon is.

Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called maturity. It’s nice; you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said to his partner Detective.

This book is not some guide to greatness—it couldn’t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves.

This book is not some guide to greatness—it couldn’t be, because greatness is merely an illusion in our minds, a made-up destination that we obligate ourselves to pursue, our own psychological Atlantis.

The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention.

If I achieve X, then I can be happy. If I look like Y, then I can be happy. If I can be with a person like Z, then I can be happy.

This premise, though, is the problem. Happiness is not a solvable equation. Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent parts of human nature and, as we’ll see, necessary components to creating consistent happiness.

If I could invent a superhero, I would invent one called Disappointment Panda. He’d wear a cheesy eye mask and a shirt (with a giant capital T on it) that was way too small for his big panda belly, and his superpower would be to tell people harsh truths about themselves that they needed to hear but didn’t want to accept.

We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no—our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.

Warren Buffett’s got money problems; the drunk hobo down at Kwik-E Mart’s got money problems. Buffett’s just got better money problems than the hobo. All of life is like this.

“The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”.

“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.” And with that, he.

“Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.”.

To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity, not something that is passively bestowed upon you, not something that you magically discover in a top-ten article on the Huffington Post or from any specific guru or teacher. It doesn’t magically appear when you finally make enough money to add on that extra room to the house. You don’t find it waiting for you in a place, an idea, a job—or even a book, for that matter.

Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy. Highs.

In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. When you feel them, life seems simple and there is nothing else to do but enjoy it.

Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments.

This is why our problems are recursive and unavoidable. The person you marry is the person you fight with. The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over. Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice—whatever makes us feel good will also inevitably make us feel bad. What we gain is also what we lose. What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences.

Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy, and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when they walk into the room.

Question, a question that most people never consider, is, “What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?” Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out. For example, most people want.

“What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?” Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.

Most people want to have great sex and an awesome relationship, but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings, and the emotional psychodrama to get there.

Because happiness requires struggle.

People want to start their own business. But you don’t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, the insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing.

What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame. You have to choose something.

And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.

The worst part was that Jimmy believed his own bullshit. His delusion was so bulletproof, it was honestly hard to get mad at him, it was actually kind of amazing.

The true measurement of self-worth is not how a person feels about her positive experiences, but rather how she feels about her negative experiences.

And because he can’t face his problems, no matter how good he feels about himself, he is weak.

When “real traumatic shit” like this happens in our lives, we begin to unconsciously feel as though we have problems that we’re incapable of ever solving.

And this assumed inability to solve our problems causes us to feel miserable and helpless.

Validation quickly fed into a mental habit of self-aggrandizing.

1.   I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 2.   I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment.

It’s not uncommon now for books to be removed from a class’s curriculum for no other reason than that they made someone feel bad. Speakers and professors are shouted down and banned from campuses for infractions as simple as suggesting that maybe some Halloween costumes really aren’t that offensive.

The more freedom we’re given to express ourselves, the more we want to be free of having to deal with anyone who may disagree with us or upset us.

Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame.

You will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. Sounds boring,.

You will have a growing appreciation for life’s basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about. Sounds boring, doesn’t it? That’s because these things are ordinary. But maybe they’re ordinary for a reason: because they are what actually matters.

Let’s say the first layer of the self-awareness onion is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. “This is when I feel happy.” “This makes me feel sad.” “This gives me hope.”.

The second layer of the self-awareness onion is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.

The third level is our personal values: Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?.

We’re apes. We think we’re all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we’re just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status. The question is not whether we evaluate ourselves against others; rather, the question is by what standard do we measure ourselves?.

In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer.

The first, which we’ll look at in the next chapter, is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.

In his diary, he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what.

We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond.

It’s every single woman’s fault for not liking a self-pitying, shallow guy with shitty values. Obviously.

Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense.

Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you’re currently making, every second of every day.

See, I couldn’t control her. No matter how many times I called her, or screamed at her, or begged her to take me back, or made surprise visits to her place, or did other creepy and irrational ex-boyfriend things, I could never control her emotions or her actions. Ultimately, while she was to blame for how I felt, she was never responsible for how I felt.

I see life in the same terms. We all get dealt cards. Some of us get better cards than others. And while it’s easy to get hung up on our cards, and feel we got screwed over, the real game lies in the choices we make with those cards, the risks we decide to take, and the consequences we choose to live with. People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they’re given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker, just as in life. And it’s not necessarily the people with the best cards.

Forgetting that. We should pick our battles carefully, while simultaneously attempting to empathize a bit with the so-called enemy. We should approach the news and media with a healthy dose of skepticism and avoid painting those who disagree with us with a broad brush.

We should pick our battles carefully, while simultaneously attempting to empathize a bit with the so-called enemy. We should approach the news and media with a healthy dose of skepticism and avoid painting those who disagree with us with a broad brush. We should prioritize values of being honest, fostering transparency, and welcoming doubt over the values of being right, feeling good, and getting revenge. These “democratic” values are harder to maintain amidst the constant noise of a networked world. But we must accept the responsibility and nurture them regardless. The future stability of our political systems may depend on it.

Five hundred years ago cartographers believed that California was an island. Doctors believed that slicing a person’s arm open (or causing bleeding anywhere) could cure disease. Scientists believed that fire was made out of something called phlogiston. Women believed that rubbing dog urine on their face had anti-aging benefits. Astronomers believed that the sun revolved around the earth.

I thought happiness was a destiny and not a choice.

Choice. I thought love was something that just happened, not something that you worked for.

It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than.

It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure.

They will laugh at how we were afraid to show appreciation for those who matter to us most, yet heaped praise on public figures who didn’t deserve anything.

My Lie: A True Story of False Memory,.

There’s a lot of conventional wisdom out there telling you to “trust yourself,” to “go with your gut,” and all sorts of other pleasant-sounding clichés. But perhaps the answer is to trust yourself less. After all, if our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our own intentions and motivations more.

It’s not only the safer option, but it’s liberating as well.

Many people have an unshakable certainty in their ability at their job or in the amount of salary they should be making.

Even a behavior as simple as sneaking a peek at your boyfriend’s text messages or asking a friend what people are saying about you is driven by insecurity and that aching desire to be certain. You can check your boyfriend’s text messages.

Even a behavior as simple as sneaking a peek at your boyfriend’s text messages or asking a friend what people are saying about you is driven by insecurity and that aching desire to be certain.

The more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel.

The more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.

“Work expands so as to fill up the time available for its completion.”.

The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid.

The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

That means the more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful/unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values, the more you will avoid ever getting around to doing it.

You avoid writing that screenplay you’ve always dreamed of because doing so would call into question your identity as a practical insurance adjuster. You avoid talking to your husband about being more adventurous in the bedroom because that conversation would challenge your identity as a good, moral woman. You avoid telling your friend that you don’t want to see him anymore because ending the friendship would conflict with your identity as a nice, forgiving person.

Because despite dreaming about making a living through his art, the real potential of becoming An Artist Nobody Likes was far, far scarier than remaining An Artist Nobody’s Heard Of. At least he was comfortable with and used to being An Artist Nobody’s Heard Of.

We all have values for ourselves. We protect these values.

Say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

Opportunities. I say don’t find yourself. I say never know who you are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

Are. Because that’s what keeps you striving and discovering. And it forces you to remain humble in your judgments and accepting of the differences in others.

When someone admits to herself, “You know, maybe I’m not good at relationships,” then she is suddenly free to act and end her bad marriage. She has no identity to protect by staying in a miserable, crappy marriage just to prove something to herself.

When we’re angry, or jealous, or upset, we’re oftentimes the last ones to figure it out.

“Am I jealous—and if I am, then why?” “Am I angry?” “Is she right, and I’m just protecting my ego?”.

“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”.

If it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself.

Instead, my value was something else. It was freedom, autonomy. The idea of being an entrepreneur had always appealed to me because I hated being told what to do and preferred to do things my way. The idea of working on the Internet appealed to me because I could do it from anywhere and work whenever I wanted.

If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.

For instance, if I measure myself by the standard “Make everyone I meet like me,” I will be anxious, because failure is 100 percent defined by the actions of others, not by my own actions. I am not in control; thus my self-worth is at the mercy of judgments by others.

Whereas if I instead adopt the metric “Improve my social life,” I can live up to my value of “good relations with others” regardless of how other people respond to me. My self-worth is based on my own behaviors and happiness.

“Express myself honestly to others,”.

If your metric for the value “success by worldly standards” is “Buy a house and a nice car,” and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it, once it’s achieved the metric has nothing left to give you. Then say hello to your midlife crisis, because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you. There are no other opportunities to keep growing and improving, and yet it’s growth that generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements.

Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded.

Life is about not knowing and then doing something anyway. All of life is like this. It never changes. Even when you’re happy. Even when you’re farting fairy dust. Even when you win the lottery and buy a small fleet of Jet Skis, you still won’t know what the hell you’re doing. Don’t ever forget that. And don’t ever be afraid of that.

I found myself sitting with my laptop and realized, for the first time, that I was entirely responsible for all of my own decisions, as well as the consequences of those decisions.

“If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.”.

Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of.

Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it.

The author Tim Ferriss relates a story he once heard about a novelist who had written over seventy novels. Someone asked the novelist how he was able to write so consistently and remain inspired and motivated. He replied, “Two hundred crappy words per day, that’s it.” The idea was that if he forced himself to write two hundred crappy words, more often than not the act of writing would inspire him; and before he knew it, he’d have thousands of words down on the page.

If we follow the “do something” principle, failure feels unimportant.

When the standard of success becomes merely acting—when any result is regarded as progress and important, when inspiration is seen as a reward rather than a prerequisite—we propel ourselves ahead. We feel free to fail, and that failure moves us forward.

Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people.

Knowing a lot of people superficially was more beneficial than knowing a few people closely.

There is such pressure in the West to be likable that people often reconfigure their entire personality depending on the person they’re dealing with.

Every turn. The point is this: we all must give a fuck about something, in order to value something. And to value something, we must reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X. That rejection is an inherent.

The point is this: we all must give a fuck about something, in order to value something. And to value something, we must reject what is not that something. To value X, we must reject non-X. That rejection is an inherent and necessary part.

It’s suspected by many scholars that Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance, but rather to satirize it, to show how absolutely nutty it was. He didn’t mean for the play to be a glorification of love. In fact, he meant it to be the opposite: a big flashing neon sign blinking KEEP OUT, with police tape around it saying DO NOT CROSS.

People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy.

People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy.

Acts of love are valid only if they’re performed without conditions or expectations.

It suggests that your relationship is conditional—based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other (along with each other’s problems).

It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby.

No one trusts a yes-man. If Disappointment Panda were here, he’d tell you that the pain in our relationship is necessary to cement our trust in each other and produce greater intimacy.

Many cheatees accept this response at face value, and don’t question the values and fucks given by their partner (pun totally intended);.

But more is not always better. In fact, the opposite is true. We are actually often happier with less. When we’re overloaded with opportunities and options, we suffer from what psychologists refer to as the paradox of choice. Basically, the more options we’re given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we’re aware of all the other options we’re potentially forfeiting.

Death is the light by which the shadow of all of life’s meaning is measured.

Without death, everything would feel inconsequential, all experience arbitrary, all metrics and values suddenly zero.

The Denial of Death, would win the Pulitzer Prize and become one of the most influential intellectual works of the twentieth century, shaking up the fields of psychology and anthropology, while making profound philosophical claims that are still influential today.

“He’s rounding the Cape of Good Hope.” Ironically, it means that the person’s life is in its final phase, that he’s incapable of accomplishing anything.

Nothing makes you present and mindful like being mere inches away from your own death.

Goofball who came in and left on Halley’s Comet, said, “The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”.

# The Great Gatsby (Fitzgerald, F. Scott)

‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.’.

I’m inclined to reserve all judgments.

If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.

Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man.

And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.

Life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.

‘Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.’.

‘Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.’.

She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.

# The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels (Alex Epstein)

But fossil fuels cause climate change,.

But fossil fuels cause pollution,.

But fossil fuels are nonrenewable,.

But fossil fuels are replaceable by solar and wind,.

Eighty-seven percent of the energy mankind uses every second, including most of the energy I am using as I write this, comes from burning one of the fossil fuels: coal, oil, or natural gas.

Every time someone uses a machine—whether the computer I am using right now, the factory it was produced in, the trucks and ships that transported it, the furnace that forged the aluminum, the farm equipment that fed all the workers who made it, or the electricity that keeps their lights on, their phones charged, and their restaurants and hospitals open—they are using energy that they must be able to rely on and afford. And 87 percent of the time, that energy comes from coal, oil, or natural gas.2 Without exception, anyone who lives a modern life is directly or indirectly using large amounts of fossil fuel energy—it is that ubiquitous.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The risks and side effects of using fossil fuels declined while the benefits—cheap, reliable energy and everything it brings—expanded to billions more people.

While college philosophy classes all too often present philosophy as an impractical subject that involves endlessly debating skeptical questions (“How do you know you exist?” “How do you know you’re not in The Matrix?”), philosophy is in fact an incredibly practical tool. No matter what we’re doing in life, whether we’re coming up with a business plan or raising children or deciding what to do about fossil fuels, it is always valuable to be able to think clearly about what is right and what is wrong and why.

During that time period, the world overall increased fossil fuel usage far more than we did. Today the world uses 39 percent more oil, 107 percent more coal, and 131 percent more natural gas than it did in 1980.26.

What will promote human life? What will promote human flourishing—realizing the full potential of life? Colloquially, how do we maximize the years in our life and the life in our years? When we look at the recent past, the past that was supposed to be so disastrous, we should look at flourishing—and that of course includes the quality (or lack thereof) of our environment.

Pessimistic predictions often assume that our environment is perfect until humans mess it.

Pessimistic predictions often assume that our environment is perfect until humans mess it up; they don’t consider the possibility that we could improve our environment.

It’s the moral case for using cheap, plentiful, reliable energy to amplify our abilities to make the world a better place—a better place for human beings.

No other energy technology besides fossil fuels can even come close to producing that energy for the foreseeable future.

The average human being needs about 2,000 calories a day to give him enough energy to do everything he needs to do—from going to the office to taking a walk to manual labor to sleeping. That’s equal to 2,326 watt-hours, which is the amount of energy it takes to power a 100-watt lightbulb for 23.26 hours.

Power is energy in action;.

Gasoline is the energy, the engine turns it into power.

Now if we were all like Superman, it would be a different story. Imagine if Superman, instead of devoting himself to saving Lois Lane and others, decided to help poor countries industrialize. He would be amazing! Superman’s superpower, after all, is power. He is a high-powered machine that stores a lot of energy in his body. He can melt iron, forge steel, plow fields, build buildings, even run an electrical system by turning some sort of especially large crank. He could transform any place for the better.

Industrial progress, mechanical improvement, all of the great wonders of the modern era have meant little to the wealthy. The rich in ancient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modern plumbing—running servants replaced running water. Television and radio—the patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home, could have the leading artists as domestic retainers. Ready-to-wear clothing, supermarkets—all these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life. They would have welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine, but for the rest, the great achievements of western capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person. These achievements have made available to the masses conveniences and amenities that were previously the exclusive prerogative of the rich and powerful.

There are 7 billion people in the world, but 1.3 billion have no electricity.7 Over 3 billion are classified as not having “adequate electricity”—a threshold that is far less than we enjoy and take for granted.8 For everyone to have as much access to energy as the average American, the world’s energy production would have to quadruple.9 And we Americans would benefit greatly from even more cheap, plentiful, reliable energy.

The top five countries ranked by solar energy consumption are Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and China. The percentage of each country’s electricity that comes from solar energy is, respectively: 4.5 percent, 6.3 percent, 4.0 percent, .09 percent, and .6 percent.

Don’t let the 16.5 percent in Spain mislead you. Spain suffered financial devastation from its investment in wind, among other bad investments.

In fact, modern solar and wind technology do not produce reliable energy, period.

The diluteness problem and the intermittency problem.

Imagine you have a company of highly productive, efficient, reliable workers. Then there is an initiative to bring in “renewable” workers, who will supposedly live forever, but they are expensive and you don’t know when they’ll show up. A document produced by them is not as valuable as a document produced by someone else—because you don’t know when theirs will arrive. A company can handle a few such workers, but it can’t be run by them.

Throughout history it has been a challenge for human beings to produce enough crops to feed us, because agriculture requires a lot of resources just to produce our meager number of calories. We need many dozens of times as many calories for our machines as we do from our food! If we could eat oil or electricity, we would, because it’s much cheaper per unit of energy. Why should we feed human food to machines with hundreds of times our appetites?.

Delivers thousands of times more energy per unit of input.

The difficulty of doing it cheaply and the perceived difficulty of doing it safely.

Fossil fuels are so called because they are (in most theories) high-energy concentrations of ancient dead plants.

The other advantage they have is that they exist in astonishingly, astonishingly large quantities. For example, the world has an estimated 3,050 years (at current usage rates) of “total remaining recoverable reserves” of coal.

But in the future, it might be worth it—which means that claims that we’ll “run out of oil” are misguided, as coal and gas can effectively produce oil if needed.

Is almost eerily engineered by natural processes, not just for cheapness, not just for reliability, not just for scalability, but also for another characteristic crucial to a functional civilization: portability.

Oil is the most coveted (and controversial) fuel in the world because it is almost eerily engineered by natural processes, not just for cheapness, not just for reliability, not just for scalability, but also for another characteristic crucial to a functional civilization: portability.

Oil, in effect, has the ultimate strength to weight ratio.

A gallon of gasoline has 31,000 calories—the amount of energy you use in fifteen days. Oil can be refined into stable, potent liquid fuels—gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.

Held it in place for decades. Portability is valuable for many reasons. Personally, oil is the fuel of freedom—the fuel that liberated Americans to go where they want, when they want. Economically, oil is the fuel of trade. Our entire standard of living depends on specialization—on people doing what they do best, wherever they are, and then being able to cheaply move their products to those who most need them. The higher the price of portable power, the slower the world economy moves.

Tesla Roadster battery has an energy density that is 107 times less than gasoline—though the battery’s electric motor can convert more than twice as much of that energy into usable energy as the engine in a gasoline-powered car, so in practice the Tesla battery might be 35 times less dense.

You are probably sitting in a room with at least fifty things derived from oil, from the insulation in your wall to the carpet under your feet to the laminate on your table to the screen on your computer. Oil is everywhere—that is how the average American uses 2.5 gallons each day.

Because oil—or coal, or natural gas, or uranium, or aluminum for that matter—is not naturally a resource.

It was a distinct raw material, to be sure, with the potential to become valuable, just as sand has the potential to become a microchip.

What turned oil from a potential resource to an actual resource was human ingenuity—the ingenuity of the chemist Benjamin Silliman Jr., who refined petroleum into kerosene, the ingenuity of George Bissell, who targeted Titusville, Pennsylvania, as a location likely to have underground oil, and the ingenuity of Edwin Drake, who created the first successful oil well in 1859 at 69.5 feet underground.

The rubber tires are made of oil, the paint and waterproofing are made of oil, the plastic, dent-resistant bumper is made of oil, the stuffing inside the seats is made of oil, and in most cars, the entire interior is one form of oil fabric or synthetic material or another—because oil is such a cheap and effective way to make things.

When a policeman has his life saved by a bulletproof vest, when a firefighter has his life saved by a fireproof jacket, that is oil—that is something that was once a useless raw material, now made into a resource.

Our concern for the future should not be running out of energy resources; it should be running out of the freedom to create energy resources, including our number-one energy resource today, fossil fuels.

More fossil fuel energy, more ability to pursue happiness.

Having a background in philosophy, I recognized that most discussion of global warming would not stand up to fifteen seconds of scrutiny by Socrates, who alienated fellow Athenians by asking them to define what they meant when they used terms vaguely. I think Socrates would have been all over anyone who spoke vaguely of global warming or climate change without making clear which version of that theory they meant: mild warming or catastrophic warming.

How does fossil fuel use affect climate livability?.

“CEOs of fossil energy companies know what they are doing [by emitting CO2] and are aware of long-term consequences of continued business as usual. In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.”.

Note in particular that since the late 1990s, there has been no increase in average temperatures.

With an elaborate equation or program that will “postdict”.

But a model is not valid until it makes real, forward predictions. It’s a truism in any field of math that if you are allowed enough complexity, you can engage in “curve fitting” for any pattern of data with an elaborate equation or program that will “postdict” exactly what happened in the past—but in no way does that mean it will predict the future. (Many investors lose money doing this sort of thing.).

Since the industrial revolution, we’ve increased CO2 in the atmosphere from .03 percent to .04 percent, and temperatures have gone up less than a degree Celsius, a rate of increase that has occurred at many points in history.25 Few deny that during the last fifteen-plus years, the time of record and accelerating emissions, there has been little to no warming—and the models failed to predict that.26 By contrast, if one assumed that CO2 in the atmosphere had no major positive feedbacks, and just warmed the atmosphere in accordance with the greenhouse effect, this mild warming is pretty much what one would get.

Idso and others, conducting thousands of experiments in controlled conditions—where everything is held constant except CO2—have convincingly demonstrated that more CO2 means more plant growth.

Worldwide increases in plant growth are nontrivial—indeed, Idso and others attribute significant portions of modern agricultural yields to increased atmospheric CO2.

Below 120 to 150 ppm CO2, most plants die, which means human beings would die. All things being equal, in terms of plant growth, agriculture, et cetera, more CO2 is better. Today’s climate gives us far less CO2 than we would like from a plant-growth perspective. We would prefer the thousands of ppm CO2 that, say, the Cretaceous period had.45.

Extremely positive plant effects of CO2 are scientifically uncontroversial yet practically never mentioned, even by the climate-science community.

What’s also striking is how, even though we all know that plants live on CO2, almost no one in the culture thinks of potential positive impacts when he thinks about his “carbon footprint.”.

My reading of the evidence is that there is a mild greenhouse effect in the direction human beings have always wanted—warmer—and a significant fertilizer effect in the direction human beings have always wanted—more plant life.

Fossil fuel energy, by enabling us to cheaply build and run wondrous machines that give us the mobility to choose any particular climate and the ability to increase the livability of that climate, has made us masters of climate. That doesn’t mean we are invulnerable, but the numbers show that we have become progressively less vulnerable. And if we care about climate livability, energy and technology have to be the focus.

Finally, on an emotional note, I think that a proper reaction to a major danger from fossil fuels would be sorrow. Think about it: If the energy that runs our civilization has a tragic flaw, that is a terribly sad thing. It would be even worse, say, than if wireless technology caused brain cancer. The appropriate attitude would be gratitude toward the fossil fuel companies for what they had done for us, combined with recognition that we would have to suffer a lot in the years ahead, combined with the commitment to the best technologies that I mentioned earlier.

“The winners of the race to reinvent energy will not only save the planet, but will also make megafortunes . . . fixing global warming won’t be a drain on the economy. On the contrary, it will unleash one of the greatest floods of new wealth in history,”.

Believe that we owe the fossil fuel industry an apology. While the industry has been producing the energy to make our climate more livable, we have treated it as a villain. We owe it the kind of gratitude that we owe anyone who makes our lives much, much better. There.

To oppose fossil fuels is ultimately to oppose the underdeveloped world.

Development means water-purification systems, irrigation, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically improved crops, dams, seawalls, heating, air-conditioning, sturdy homes, drained swamps, central power stations, vaccination, pharmaceuticals, and so on.

When we transform those ancient dead plants into energy, bad things can happen.

Modern coal technology can harness coal energy extremely cheaply, and it is available in enormous quantities in many regions of the world. One of its disadvantages lies in its natural properties. As a solid fuel of condensed biological origin, it includes a lot of materials that were part of the natural environment long ago and that are potentially harmful to human health, such as sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy metals.

“the most dangerous part of a trip to a coal mine is the drive there.”.

Respect individual rights, including property rights. You have a right to your person and property, including the air and water around you. Past a certain point, it is illegal for anyone to affect you or your property. But—and here’s where things get tricky—it’s not obvious what that point is. Let’s look at two extremes.

The role of government is to pass laws based on individual rights and standards set according to science and the current state of technological evolution. The job of industry is to continue that evolution.

Countries with higher pollution levels have systematically shown lower rates of chronic respiratory diseases like asthma.

A poison or pollutant is always a combination of substance and dose.

One variant of this argument used to attack shale energy is the claim that fracking causes earthquakes.

This assertion is true in that fracking causes some amount of underground, earth-moving activity, but in almost all cases, it is completely inconsequential and not even discernible at the surface.

What about a worst-case scenario? Many say that it’s between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, which means you can feel the quake but it’s unlikely strong enough to cause damage.22 And this is an incredibly unlikely scenario. For this we are supposed to ban all fracking?.

Even if fracking in a certain place had a high risk of a truly dangerous earthquake—say, because it is near some seismically vulnerable area—that is an argument against fracking in that particular place, not an argument against fracking as such.

Typical tremor that can be caused by hydraulic fracturing is −2 on the Richter scale, a “quake” that is not felt at the surface, causes no damage, and can be measured only deep underground. Such quakes are occurring continuously throughout the Earth, fracking or no fracking.

It especially doesn’t make sense to be biased against man-made things, because they are deliberately made by a human mind, usually to promote human life. While man-made things can be bad, it is perverse to single out the man-made as bad per se. To be against the man-made as such is to have a bias against the mind-made, which is to be against the human mind, whose very purpose is to figure out how to transform our environment to meet our needs.

And just as we use computers to help solve computer problems, so we can use fossil fuels to help solve fossil fuel problems—to transform waste from a more dangerous form to a less dangerous form, or even to a benefit, by using energy and ingenuity.

In most realms, we accept and desire constant change. For example, you want the best phone with the best materials, regardless of whether those materials will be there in two hundred years and regardless of whether it would be more “renewable” to use two cups and a string.

There is no inherent limit to energy resources—we just need human ingenuity to be free to discover ways to turn unusable energy into usable energy. This opens up a thrilling possibility: the endless potential for improving life through ever growing energy resources helping create ever growing resources of every kind. This is the principle that explains the strong correlation between fossil fuel use and life expectancy, fossil fuel use and income, fossil fuel use and pretty much anything good: human ingenuity transforming potential resources into actual resources—including the most fundamental resource, energy.

We are not eating the last slice of pizza in the box or scraping the bottom of the barrel; we are standing on the tip of an endless iceberg.

The final point to make about consumption and efficiency and waste is that the most valuable thing we have is our time. If we want to talk about a resource, if human life is our standard, then the most important resource we should be focused on is our time. Using fossil fuels buys us time. It buys us more life. It buys us more opportunities. It buys us more resources. Fossil fuels are an amazing tool with which to create this ultimate form of wealth, this supreme resource: time to use our minds and our bodies to enjoy our lives as much as possible.

Someone had to do something, and I had control of exactly one person.

Anytime someone is oblivious to the positive and inclined toward the negative, he has a prejudice.

The prejudice, which is held consistently by our environmental thought leaders and inconsistently by the culture at large is the idea that nonimpact on nature is the standard of value. It is better known by a single color: Green.

He’s talking about something that could take someone who had never had access to a lightbulb for more than an hour, and give him all the light he needed for the rest of his life. He’s talking about something that would have given that hospital in The Gambia the power that it needed to save the two dead babies in the story, who could have been thriving eight-year-olds as I write this, instead of painful memories for would-be parents.

Prince Philip, former head of the World Wildlife Fund, has said, “In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.”.

“Until such time as Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, some of us can only hope for the right virus to come along.”.

Another reason we buy into Green is because we as a culture have never been fully comfortable with human industry. We’re taught that the pursuit of profit is wrong, that capitalism is wrong, and that we should feel guilty for our wealth and way of life.

We don’t want to “save the planet” from human beings; we want to improve the planet for human beings.

Making a moral case always means naming your standard—for us, human life.

There is only one way to defeat the environmentalists’ moral case against fossil fuels—refute its false central idea that fossil fuels destroy the planet. If we don’t refute that idea, we accept it, and if we accept that fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the only logical conclusion is to cease new development and slow down existing development as much as possible.

Fossil fuel companies, particularly oil and gas companies, proudly feature windmills on Web pages and annual reports, even though these are trivial to their bottom line and wildly uneconomic. This obviously implies that renewables are the goal, oil and gas being a temporarily necessary evil.

Not mentioning the word “oil” on home pages (this has at times been true of ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron). This implies that you’re ashamed of what you do and that your critics are right that oil is a self-destructive addiction.

Focusing attention on everything but your core product—community service initiatives, charitable contributions, et cetera. This implies that you’re ashamed of your core product.

Praising your attackers as “idealistic.” This implies that those who want your.

Praising your attackers as “idealistic.” This implies that those who want your destruction are pursuing a legitimate ideal.

Spending most of your time on the defensive. This implies that you don’t have something positive to champion.

Apologizing for your “environmental footprint.” This implies that there’s something wrong with the industrial development that is inherent in energy production.

Criticizing your opponents primarily for getting their facts wrong without refuting their basic moral argument. This implies that the argument is right but your opponents just need to identify your evils more precisely.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.”.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.” What you’re telling the world is that you are a necessary.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.” What you’re telling the world is that you are a necessary evil.

That is, a revolution in fossil fuel technology occurred because our government didn’t know enough about it to demonize and ban it. This is not the kind of thing we want to depend on.

We are still arguably at the beginning of the fossil fuel age.

Wrote this book so you could hand it to the people who matter most to you—and so that you could take its ideas and make them your own, telling the people who matter to you how you think and feel.

What we are not taught is that the biggest risk is not using fossil fuels, and that using them is incredibly virtuous.

The unpopular but moral cause of our time is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are easy to misunderstand and demonize, but they are absolutely good to use. And they absolutely need to be championed.

Mankind’s use of fossil fuels is supremely virtuous—because human life is the standard of value, and because using fossil fuels transforms our environment to make it wonderful for human life.

Petr Beckmann.


# Influence (Robert B. Cialdini)

A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason.

Price alone had become a trigger feature for quality;.

Automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much of human action, because in many cases it is the most efficient form of behaving, and in other cases it is simply necessary.

“civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”.

Not only do we expect them to save us money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy required to think about how to do it. In.

Not only do we expect them to save us money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy required to think about how to do it. In today’s world, we need the first advantage to handle pocketbook strain; but we need the second advantage to handle something potentially more important—brain strain.

Take, for example, the deadly trick played by the killer females of one genus of firefly (Photuris) on the males of another firefly genus (Photinus). Understandably, the Photinus males scrupulously avoid contact with the bloodthirsty Photuris females. But through centuries of experience, the female hunters have located a weakness in their prey—a special blinking courtship code by which members of the victims’ species tell one another they are ready to mate. Somehow, the Photuris female has cracked the Photinus courtship code. By mimicking the flashing mating signals of her prey, the murderess is able to feast on the bodies of males whose triggered courtship tapes cause them to fly mechanically into death’s, not love’s, embrace.

Culturist and author Leo Rosten gives the example of the Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men’s tailor shop in Rosten’s neighborhood while he was growing up in the 1930s. Whenever the salesman, Sid, had a new customer trying on suits in front of the shop’s three-sided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem, and, as they talked, he would repeatedly request that the man speak more loudly to him. Once the customer had found a suit he liked and had asked for the price, Sid would call to his brother, the head tailor, at the back of the room, “Harry, how much for this suit?” Looking up from his work—and greatly exaggerating the suit’s true price—Harry would call back, “For that beautiful all-wool suit, forty-two dollars.” Pretending not to have heard and cupping his hand to his ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply, “Forty-two dollars.” At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and report, “He says twenty-two dollars.” Many a man would hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the shop with his “expensive = good” bargain before Poor Sid discovered the “mistake.”.

This last feature of the process allows the exploiters an enormous additional benefit—the ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation.

So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions besides weight. If we are talking to a beautiful woman at a cocktail.

So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one. The contrast principle is well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts of perceptions besides weight. If we are talking to a beautiful woman at a cocktail party and are then joined by an unattractive one, the second woman will strike us as less attractive than she actually is.

Retail clothiers are a good example. Suppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store and says that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money? Clothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a sweater. But the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive.

Action of one of the most potent of the weapons of influence around us—the rule for reciprocation.1.

If a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own;.

A couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours.

If a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours.

By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like.

“We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation,”3.

Regan was also interested in how liking for a person affects the tendency to comply with that person’s request.

Most of us would have guessed that people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like.

“Twenty years ago, I asked ten friends to help me move. He was the only one who showed up.”.

“There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.”6.

A small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger return favor.

Or, more generally, why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger return favors?.

Knew that to be the case because: (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dollars; (c) I was standing there with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking away with two of my dollars.

Would appear, then, that the larger the initial request, the more effective the procedure, since there would be more room available for illusory concessions.

The rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires.11.

Just after placing a bet, they are much more confident of their horse’s chances of winning than they are immediately before laying down that bet.1.

It is, quite simply, our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done.

Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.

Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait.

The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don’t match may be seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally ill.

The tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual compliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique.

What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only.

What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger requests, it can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors that are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It’s this second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me.

You can use small commitments to manipulate a person’s self-image; you can use them to turn citizens into “public servants,” prospects into “customers,” prisoners into “collaborators.” And once you’ve got a man’s self-image where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with this view of himself.

What those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true.

And the evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it.

Prohibit alcohol, and you probably can’t eliminate hazing!”13.

Long as it is the case that people like and believe in what they have struggled to get, these groups will continue to arrange effortful and troublesome initiation rites.

The agonies of “boot camp” initiations to the armed services are legendary. The novelist William Styron, a former Marine, catalogs his own experiences in language we could easily apply to the Thongas (or, for that matter, to the Kappas or Betas or Alphas): “the remorseless close-order drill hour after hour in the burning sun, the mental and physical abuse,.

It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person’s self-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effortful.

It was not enough to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner responsibility for their actions.

Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures.

All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests that.

All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take.

An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed. It seems almost incredible that a customer would buy a car under these circumstances. Yet it works—not on everybody, of course, but it is effective enough to be a staple compliance procedure in many, many car showrooms. Automobile dealers have come to understand the ability of a personal commitment to build its own support system, a support system of new justifications for the commitment.

Whenever my stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request merely because doing so would be consistent with some prior commitment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester. I don’t try to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity of foolish consistency. Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away guiltily or retreats in bewilderment, I am content. I have won; an exploiter has lost.

The greater the number of people who find any idea correct, the more the idea will be correct. The group’s assignment was clear; since the physical evidence could not be changed, the social evidence had to be. Convince and ye shall be convinced!6.

The tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called “pluralistic ignorance.”.

The failure of entire groups of bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help.

The fascinating upshot of Latané and Darley’s reasoning is that, for the emergency victim, the idea of “safety in numbers” may often be completely wrong. It might be that someone in need of emergency aid would have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than a crowd, was present.

The key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help because the bystanders are unsure rather than unkind. They don’t help because they are unsure of whether an emergency actually exists and whether they are responsible for taking action. When they are sure of their responsibilities for intervening in a clear emergency,.

The key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help because the bystanders are unsure rather than unkind. They don’t help because they are unsure of whether an emergency actually exists and whether they are responsible for taking action. When they are sure of their responsibilities for intervening in a clear emergency, people are exceedingly responsive!.

Professor Phillips’s findings have persuaded me of a distressing tendency for suicide publicity to motivate certain people who are similar to the victim to kill themselves—because they now find the idea of suicide more legitimate.

When such a match was lost by a black fighter, the homicide rate during the following ten days rose significantly for young black male victims but not young white males. On the other hand, when a white fighter lost a match, it was young white men but not young black men who were killed more frequently in the next ten days.14 When these results are combined with the parallel findings in Phillips’s suicide data, it is clear that widely publicized aggression has the nasty tendency to spread to similar victims, no matter whether the aggression is inflicted on the self or on another.

We have already seen that when people are uncertain, they look to the actions of others to guide their own actions.

So if a pair of freeway drivers decided by coincidence to change lanes at the identical moment, the next two drivers might well do the same,.

A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices.2.

Other experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience.

Each month he sent every one of his more than thirteen thousand former customers a holiday greeting card containing a personal message.

We are phenomenal suckers for flattery. Although there are limits to our gullibility—especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manipulate us—we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who provide it, oftentimes when it is clearly false.

When the teacher calls on one child, you see looks of disappointment and dismay on the faces of the eager students, who missed a chance to get the teacher’s approval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others who didn’t know the answer…. This game is fiercely competitive and the stakes are high, because the kids are competing for the love and approval of one of the.

When the teacher calls on one child, you see looks of disappointment and dismay on the faces of the eager students, who missed a chance to get the teacher’s approval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others who didn’t know the answer…. This game is fiercely competitive and the stakes are high, because the kids are competing for the love and approval of one of the two or three most important people in their world.

Further, this teaching process guarantees that the children will not learn to like and understand each other. Conjure up your own experience. If you knew the right answer and the teacher called on someone else, you probably hoped that he or she would make a mistake so that you would have a chance to display your knowledge. If you were called on and failed, or if you didn’t even raise your hand to compete, you probably envied and resented your classmates who knew the answer. Children who fail in this system become jealous and resentful of the successes, putting them down as teacher’s pets or even resorting to violence against them in the school yard.

“The nature of bad news,” he said, “infects the teller.” There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news. The simple association with it is enough to stimulate our dislike.20.

“All things being equal, you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality…and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win.”26.

“In the twenty-five minutes I’ve known this guy, have I come to like him more than I would have expected?”.

When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other person?.

More alarming still, not one of the forty subjects in this study quit his job as Teacher when the victim first began to demand his release; nor later, when he began to beg for it; nor even later, when his reaction to each shock had become, in Milgram’s words, “definitely an agonized scream.”.

Information from a recognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut for deciding how to act in a situation.

Early on, these people (for example, parents, teachers) knew more than we did, and we found that taking their advice proved beneficial—partly because of their greater wisdom and partly because they controlled our rewards and punishments.

Finely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of status and position, as do trappings such as jewelry and cars.

“I’m afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead the____or the____?” (Here Vincent suggested a pair of menu items that were fifty cents or so less expensive than the dish the patron had selected initially.) “They are both excellent tonight.”.

Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those interests extremely well.

Principle—that opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited—I.

The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making.

Imperfections that would otherwise make for rubbish make for prized possessions when they bring along an abiding scarcity.

As opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have.

When our freedom to have something is limited, the item becomes less available, and we experience an increased desire for it. However, we rarely recognize that psychological reactance has caused us to want the item more; all we know is that we want it. Still, we need to make sense of our desire for the item, so we begin to assign it positive qualities to justify the desire.

Become less available to us, or those things that have always been scarce?.

Do we value more those things that have recently become less available to us, or those things that have always been scarce?.

The drop from abundance to scarcity produced a decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant scarcity.

Our shortcut approach was likened to the automatic responding of lower animals, whose elaborate behavior patterns could be triggered by the presence of a lone stimulus feature—a “cheep-cheep” sound, a shade of red breast feather, or a specific sequence of light flashes. The reason infrahumans must often rely on such solitary stimulus features is their restricted mental capability.

That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so.

That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making our compliance decisions.

In deciding whether to say yes or no to a requester, it is clear that we frequently pay attention to but one piece of the relevant information in the situation. We have been exploring several of the most popular of the single pieces of information that we use to prompt our compliance decisions.

John Stuart Mill, the British economist, political thinker, and philosopher of science, died more than a hundred years ago. The year of his death (1873) is important because he is reputed to have been the last man to know everything there was to know in the world.


# Discovery of India (Jawaharlal Nehru)

I had all this wealth to draw upon and the only limitation was my own capacity to profit by it.

I have felt tempted to add and revise, but I have resisted the temptation. Indeed I could not have done otherwise for life outside prison is of a different texture and there is no leisure for thought or writing.

By the end of the First World War in 1918,.

Looked at her as a friendly Westerner might have done. I was eager and anxious to change her outlook and appearance.

Nehru was imprisoned nine times, for a total of almost nine years.

Knowing India meant knowing its immense variety—and knowing also that this was its great strength.

In the spring and summer of 1944, as fragmentary news of the world was filtering through to him in his cell—the Soviet pushback against the Nazis, the Allied landings on the Normandy coast—a new conviction, though, did begin to gather shape. The old order of Imperial Europe, which still held the world and India in its grip, seemed to be moving towards its end. A historical turning point was at hand. ‘My own troubles and self,’ he now wrote in a manuscript that had begun to grow, ‘sink into insignificance.’.

British—the British had colonized not just India’s physical self, but also its historical imagination, and therefore its ability to conceive future possibilities.

What was needed was a self-help book for a start-up nation.

1942. It is not a work of original historical scholarship. It is an act of political and literary imagination.

Gandhi could appear rock-like and immoveable in his assertion of moral positions and ethical choices.

Gandhi could appear rock-like and immoveable in his assertion of moral positions and ethical choices. But Gandhi also had a non-dogmatic capacity to adapt: he was willing to put up with the ‘lesser evil, and hoped that his teaching would gradually sink into the mind of India.’.

Gandhi’s practice thus followed a cyclical pattern: ethical assertion, then political action, and back to ethical renewal.

Clear—‘Today she is four hundred million separate individual men and women, each differing from the other, each living in a private universe of thought and feeling.’.

‘What have I discovered?’ Nehru asked as he drew his narrative to a close—and his answer rang clear—‘Today she is four hundred million separate individual men and women, each differing from the other, each living in a private universe of thought and feeling.’ Ultimately, to have won through to that recognition of Indian individuality, of myriad private universes of thought and feeling, and to see that as being precisely the source of India’s strength (and not some mystical collective national feeling or being)—that was Nehru’s great achievement in The Discovery of India.

Men were dying all over the world and killing each other in battle; usually a quick death, often a brave death, death for a cause, death with a purpose, death which seemed in this mad world of ours an inexorable logic of events, a sudden end to the life we could not mould or control. Death was common enough everywhere.

But in spite of governmental obstruction and desire to minimize the overwhelming tragedy of Bengal, sensitive and warm-hearted men and women in England and America and elsewhere came to our help. Above all, the Governments of China and Eire, poor in their own resources, full of their own difficulties, yet having had bitter experience themselves of famine and misery and sensing what ailed the body and spirit of India, gave generous help. India has a long memory, but whatever else she remembers or forgets, she will not forget these gracious and friendly acts.

How Japanese aggression in China had moved India deeply and revived the age-old friendship for China;.

There was a time, not so long ago, when they praised Hitler and Mussolini, and held them up as models, and when they cursed the Soviet Union with bell, book, and candle. Not so now, for the weather has changed. They are high government and state officials, and loudly they proclaim their anti-fascism and anti-nazism and even talk of democracy, though with bated breath, as something desirable but distant. I often wonder what they would have done if events had taken a different turn, and yet there is little reason for conjecture, for they would welcome with garlands and addresses of welcome whoever happened to wield authority.

‘a man can do what he will, but not will as he will.’.

Death is the birthright of every person born—a curious way of putting an obvious thing. It is a birthright which nobody has denied or can deny, and which all of us seek to forget and escape so long as we may. And yet there was something novel and attractive about the phrase. Those who complain so bitterly of life have always a way out of it, if they so choose. That is always in our power to achieve. If we cannot master life we can at least master death. A pleasing thought lessening the feeling of helplessness.

Not to act was a complete confession of failure and a submission to evil; to act meant often enough a compromise with some form of that evil, with all the untoward consequences that such compromises result in.

Religion, as I saw it practised, and accepted even by thinking minds, whether it was Hinduism or Islam or Buddhism or Christianity, did not attract me. It seemed to be closely associated with superstitious practices and dogmatic beliefs, and behind it lay a method of approach to life’s problems which was certainly not that of science. There was an element of magic about it, an uncritical credulousness, a reliance on the supernatural.

Science does not tell us much, or for the matter of that anything about the purpose of life.

Religion merges into mysticism and metaphysics and philosophy. There have been great mystics, attractive figures, who cannot easily be disposed of as self-deluded fools. Yet mysticism (in the narrow sense of the word) irritates me; it appears to be vague and soft and flabby, not a rigorous discipline of the mind but a surrender of mental faculties and a living in a sea of emotional experience. The experience may lead occasionally to some insight into inner and less obvious processes, but it is also likely to lead to self-delusion.

Essentially, I am interested in this world, in this life, not in some other world or a future life. Whether there is such a thing as a soul, or whether there is a survival after death or not, I do not know; and, important as these.

Essentially, I am interested in this world, in this life, not in some other world or a future life. Whether there is such a thing as a soul, or whether there is a survival after death or not, I do not know; and, important as these questions are, they do not trouble me in the least.

I had little patience with leftist groups in India, spending much of their energy in mutual conflict and recrimination over fine points of doctrine which did not interest me at all. Life is too complicated and, as far as we can understand it in our present state of knowledge, too illogical, for it to be confined within the four corners of a fixed doctrine.

Space-time and the quantum theory utterly changed the picture of the physical world. More recent researches into the nature of matter, the structure of the atom, the transmutation of the elements, and the transformation of electricity and light, either into the other, have carried human knowledge much further. Man no longer sees nature as something apart and distinct from himself. Human destiny appears to become a part of nature’s rhythmic energy.

‘Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms.’.

Internal conflict of the spirit of man. How amazing is this spirit of man! In spite of innumerable failings, man, throughout.

How amazing is this spirit of man! In spite of innumerable failings, man, throughout the ages, has sacrificed his life and all he held dear for an ideal, for truth, for faith, for country and honour. That ideal may change, but that capacity for self-sacrifice continues, and, because of that, much may be forgiven to man, and it is impossible to lose hope for him.

There was a certain distaste for just throwing out a book which had no particular significance.

It was easy enough to write, but to write something that was worthwhile was another matter, something that would not grow stale while I sat in prison with my manuscript and the world went on changing.

The courage of a beautiful woman, Chand Bibi, who defended this fort and led her forces, sword in hand, against the imperial armies of Akbar. She was murdered by one of her own men.

‘We must look the world in the face with calm and clear eyes even though the eyes of the world are blood-shot today.’.

Sometimes, looking into her eyes, I would find a stranger peeping out at me.

In the long autumn evenings I sat by myself in my room in the pension, where I was staying, or sometimes went out for a walk across the fields or through the forest. A hundred pictures of Kamala succeeded each other in my mind, a hundred aspects of her rich and deep personality. We had been married for nearly twenty years, and yet how many times she had surprised me by something new in her mental or spiritual make-up. I had known her in so many ways and, in later years, I had tried my utmost to understand her. That understanding had not been denied to me, but I often wondered if I really knew her or understood her. There was something elusive about her, something fay-like, real but unsubstantial, difficult to grasp. Sometimes, looking into her eyes, I would find a stranger peeping out at me.

She was reserved to those she did not know or did not like, but bubbling over with gaiety and frankness before those she knew and liked.

She was quick in her judgment and not always fair or right, but she stuck to her instinctive likes and dislikes.

She disliked a person, it was obvious, and she made no attempt to hide the fact.

If she disliked a person, it was obvious, and she made no attempt to hide the fact.

Am Chitra. No goddess to be worshipped, nor yet the object of common pity to be brushed aside like a moth with indifference. If you deign to keep me by your side in the path of danger and daring, if you allow me to share the great duties of your life, then you will know my true self.’.

‘I am Chitra. No goddess to be worshipped, nor yet the object of common pity to be brushed aside like a moth with indifference. If you deign to keep me by your side in the path of danger and daring, if you allow me to share the great duties of your life, then you will know my true self.’.

I thought of my autobiography, that record of my life, which I had discussed with her as she lay in Bhowali Sanatorium. And, as I was writing it, sometimes I would take a chapter or two and read it out to her. She had only seen or heard a part of it: she would never see the rest; nor would we write any more chapters together in the book of life.

What is this India, apart from her physical and geographical aspects? What did she represent in the past? What gave strength to her then? How did she lose that old strength? And has she lost it completely? Does she represent anything vital now, apart from being the home of a vast number of human beings? How does she fit into the modern world?.

India was in my blood and there was much in her that instinctively thrilled me. And yet I approached her almost as an alien critic, full of dislike for the present as well as for many of the relics of the past that I saw. To some extent I came to her via the West, and looked at her as a friendly Westerner might have done. I was eager and anxious to change her outlook and appearance and give her the garb of modernity. And yet doubts arose within me. Did I know India?—I who presumed to scrap much of her past heritage? There was a great deal that had to be scrapped, that must be scrapped; but surely India could not have been what she undoubtedly was, and could not have continued a cultured existence for thousands of years, if she had not possessed something very vital and enduring, something that was worthwhile. What was this something?.

The world also will survive the horror of today and build itself anew on fresh foundations.

Sometimes we are told that our nationalism is a sign of our backwardness and even our demand for independence indicates our narrow-mindedness.

India, constituted as she is, cannot play a secondary part in the world. She will either count for a great deal or not count at all. No middle position attracted me. Nor did I think any intermediate position feasible.

How everywhere the peasants put me identical questions, for their troubles were the same—poverty, debt, vested interests, landlords, moneylenders, heavy rents and taxes, police harassment, and all these wrapped up in the structure that the foreign Government had imposed upon us—and relief must also come for all.

Sometimes as I reached a gathering, a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki Jai—‘Victory to Mother India.’ I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Bharat Mata, Mother India, whose victory they wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and then not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at each other and at me. I persisted in my questioning. At last a vigorous Jat, wedded to the soil from immemorial generations, would say that it was the dharti, the good earth of India, that they meant. What earth? Their particular village patch, or all the patches in the district or province, or in the whole of India? And so question and answer went on, till they would.

I would endeavour to do so and explain that India was all this that they had thought, but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, and the forests and the broad fields, which gave us food, were all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are in a manner yourselves Bharat Mata, and as this idea slowly soaked into their brains, their eyes would light up as if they had made a great discovery.

The frontier area was one of the principal centres of old Indian culture and it abounds still with ruins of monuments and monasteries and, especially, of the great university of Taxila, which was at the height of its fame two thousand years ago, attracting students from all over India as well as different parts of Asia. Changes of religion made a difference, but could not change entirely the mental backgrounds which the people of those areas had developed.

Today, when the conception of nationalism has developed much more, Indians in foreign countries inevitably form a national group and hang together for various purposes, in spite of their internal differences.

My appeal was an ideological one and I hardly referred to the candidates, except as standard-bearers of our cause. I knew many of them, but there were many I did not know at all, and I saw no reason why I should burden my mind with hundreds of names. I asked for votes for the Congress, for the independence of India, and for the struggle for independence. I made no promises, except to promise unceasing struggle till freedom was attained. I told people to vote for us only if they understood and accepted our objective and our programme, and were prepared to live up to them; not otherwise. I charged them not to vote for the Congress if they disagreed with this objective or programme. We wanted no false votes, no votes for particular persons because they liked them. Votes and elections would not take us far; they were just small steps in a long journey, and to delude us with votes, without intelligent acceptance of what they signified or willingness for subsequent action, was to play us false and be untrue to our country. Individuals did not count, though we wanted good and true individuals to represent us; it was the cause that counted, the organization that represented it, and the nation to whose freedom we were pledged. I analysed that freedom and what it should mean to the hundreds of millions of our people. We wanted no change of masters from white to brown, but a real people’s rule, by the people and for the people, and an ending of our poverty and misery.

The Indus Valley Civilization, of which impressive remains have been discovered at Mohenjo Daro in Sind and at Harappa in the Western Punjab, is the earliest picture that we have of India’s past.

‘One thing that stands out clear and unmistakable both at Mohenjo Daro and Harappa is that the civilization hitherto revealed at these two places is not an incipient civilization, but one already age-old and stereotyped on Indian soil, with many millenniums of human endeavour behind it. Thus India must henceforth be recognised, along with Persia, Mesopotamia and Egypt, as one of the most important areas where the civilizing processes were initiated and developed.’ And,.

‘infinitely absorbent like the ocean.’.

It is odd to think of India, with her caste system and exclusiveness, having this astonishing inclusive capacity to absorb foreign races and cultures.

Perhaps it was due to this that she retained her vitality and rejuvenated herself from time to time.

The word ‘Hindu’ does not occur at all in our ancient literature. The first reference to it in an Indian book is, I am told, in a Tantrik work of the eighth century AC, where ‘Hindu’ means a people and not the followers of a particular religion. But it is clear that the word is a very old one, as it occurs in the Avesta and in old Persian. It was used then and for a thousand years or more later by the peoples of western and central Asia for India, or rather for the people living on the other side of the Indus river. The word is clearly derived from Sindhu, the old, as well as the present, Indian name for the Indus. From this Sindhu came the words Hindu and Hindustan, as well as Indus and India.

Buddhism and Jainism were certainly not Hinduism or even the Vedic dharma. Yet they arose in India and were integral parts of Indian life, culture and philosophy. A Buddhist or Jain in India is a hundred per cent product of Indian thought and culture, yet neither is a Hindu by faith.

Buddhism and Jainism were certainly not Hinduism or even the Vedic dharma. Yet they arose in India and were integral parts of Indian life, culture and philosophy. A Buddhist or Jain in India is a hundred per cent product of Indian thought and culture, yet neither is a Hindu by faith. It is, therefore, entirely misleading to refer to Indian culture as Hindu culture. In later ages this culture was greatly influenced by the impact of Islam, and yet it remained basically and distinctively Indian.

Mahatma Gandhi has attempted to define it: ‘If I were asked to define the Hindu creed, I should simply say: Search after truth through nonviolent means. A man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu. Hinduism is a relentless pursuit after truth … Hinduism is the religion of truth. Truth is God. Denial of God we have known. Denial of truth we have not known.’ Truth and non-violence, so says Gandhi: but many eminent and undoubted Hindus say that non-violence, as Gandhi understands it, is no essential part of the Hindu creed. We thus have truth left by itself as the distinguishing mark of Hinduism. That, of course, is no definition at all.

A Christian or a Muslim could, and often did, adapt himself to the Indian way of life and culture, and yet remained in faith an orthodox Christian or Muslim. He had Indianized himself and become an Indian without changing his religion.

‘Hindi’ has nothing to do with religion, and a Muslim or Christian Indian is as much a Hindi as a person who follows Hinduism as a religion.

Unfortunately, the word ‘Hindi’ has become associated in India with a particular script—the devanagri script of Sanskrit—and so it has become difficult to use it in its larger and more natural significance.

Today, the word ‘Hindustani’ is used for Indian; it is, of course, derived from Hindustan.

Before the discovery of the Indus Valley civilization, the Vedas were supposed to be the earliest records we possess of Indian culture.

The usual date accepted by most scholars today for the hymns of the Rig Veda is 1500 BC, but there is a tendency, ever since the Mohenjo Daro excavations, to date further back these early Indian scriptures.

The usual date accepted by most scholars today for the hymns of the Rig Veda is 1500 BC, but there is a tendency, ever since the Mohenjo Daro excavations, to date further back these early Indian scriptures. Whatever the exact date may be, it is probable that this literature is earlier than that of either Greece or Israel, that, in fact, it represents some of the earliest documents of the human mind that we possess. Max Müller has called it: ‘The first word spoken by the Aryan man.’.

Avesta is nearer the Veda than the Veda is to its own epic Sanskrit.

I have always hesitated to read books of religion. The totalitarian claims made on their behalf did not appeal to me.

I could consider them as having been written by human beings, very wise and far-seeing, but nevertheless ordinary mortals, and not incarnations or mouthpieces of a divinity, about whom I had no knowledge or surety whatever.

It has always seemed to me a much more magnificent and impressive thing that a human being should rise to great heights, mentally and spiritually, and should then seek to raise others up, rather than that he should be the mouthpiece of a divine or superior power.

Mythology affected me in much the same way. If people believed in the factual content of these stories, the whole thing was absurd and ridiculous. But as soon as one ceased believing in them, they appeared in a new light, a new beauty, a wonderful flowering of a richly endowed imagination, full of human lessons.

The Vedas (from the root vid, to know) were simply meant to be a collection of the existing knowledge of the day;.

The early Vedic Aryans were so full of the zest for life that they paid little attention to the soul.

By the time we reach the end of the Veda, the Vedanta (anta, meaning end), we have the philosophy of the Upanishads.

The Rig Veda, the first of the Vedas, is probably the earliest book that humanity possesses.

‘a poetic testament of a people’s collective reaction to the wonder and awe of existence.

Many western writers have encouraged the notion that Indians are otherworldly.

If Buddhism, a typical product of Indian thought and culture, had merely been a doctrine of life negation or denial, it would surely have had some such effect on the hundreds of millions who profess it. Yet, as a matter of fact, the Buddhist countries are full of evidence to the contrary, and the Chinese people are an outstanding example of what affirmation of life can be.

This idea of detachment runs through Indian thought and philosophy, as it does through most other philosophies.

This idea of detachment runs through Indian thought and philosophy, as it does through most other philosophies. It is another way of saying that a right balance and equilibrium should be kept between the visible and invisible worlds, for if there is too much attachment to action in the visible world, the other world is forgotten and fades away, and action itself becomes without ultimate purpose.

It must be remembered that the business of philosophy in India was not confined to a few philosophers or highbrows. Philosophy was an essential part of the religion of the masses; it percolated to them in some attenuated form and created that philosophic outlook which became nearly as common in India as it is in China.

Caste began with a hard and fast division between Aryans and non-Aryans, the latter again being divided into the Dravidian races and the aboriginal tribes.

Aryans as a whole were agriculturists and agriculture was considered a noble occupation. The tiller of the soil functioned also as priest, soldier, or trader, and there was no privileged order of priests. The caste divisions, originally intended to separate.

And if I were to ask myself from what literature we here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw the corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life—again I should point to India.’.

‘If there is one place on the face of the earth where all the dreams of living men have found a home from the very earliest days when man began the dream of existence, it is India.’.

‘There is nothing higher than the person,’.

‘Truth wins ever, not falsehood. With truth is paved the road to the Divine.’.

‘Lead me from the unreal to the real! Lead me from darkness to light! Lead me from death to immortality.’.

‘My body will be reduced to ashes and my breath will join the restless and deathless air, but not I and my deeds. O mind, remember this always, remember this.’.

Most of the myths and stories are heroic in conception and teach adherence to truth and the pledged word, whatever the consequences, faithfulness unto death and even beyond, courage, good works and sacrifice for the common good.

Every nation and people seem to be affected by this desire to gild and better the past and distort it to their advantage.

‘As the most beautiful image carved by man was not the god, but only a symbol to help towards conceiving the god; so the god himself, when conceived, was not the reality but only a symbol to help towards conceiving the reality … Meanwhile they issued no creeds that contradicted knowledge, no commands that made man sin against his own inner light.’.

Russian oriental scholars have produced a Russian translation of the Mahabharata.

‘The foreign reader … is at once struck by two features: in the first place its unity in complexity; and, in the second, its constant efforts to impress on its hearers the idea of a single centralized India, with a heroic tradition of her own as formative and uniting impulse.’.

Even apart from the philosophy of the Gita, it lays stress on ethical and moral principles in statecraft and in life generally. Without this foundation of dharma there is no true happiness and society cannot hold together. The aim is social welfare, not the welfare of a particular group only but of the whole world, for ‘the entire world of mortals is a self-dependent organism.’.

The emphasis on non-violence, here and elsewhere, is interesting, for no obvious contradiction appears to be noticed between this and fighting for a righteous cause. The whole epic centres round a great war. Evidently the conception of ahimsa, non-violence, had a great deal to do with the motive, the absence of the violent mental approach, self-discipline and control of anger and hatred, rather than the physical abstention from violent action, when this became necessary and inevitable.

‘Thou shalt not do to others what is disagreeable to thyself’.

‘Whatever is not conducive to social welfare, or what ye are likely to be ashamed of, never do’.

‘Truth, self-control, asceticism, generosity, non-violence, constancy in virtue—these are the means of success, not caste or family’.

If a small ruler on the frontier could fight thus, what of the larger and more powerful kingdoms further south? Probably this was the main reason why his army refused to march further and insisted on returning.

The quality of India’s military strength was seen very soon after Alexander’s return and death, when Seleucus attempted another invasion. He was defeated by Chandragupta and driven back. Indian armies then had an advantage which others lacked; this was the possession of trained war-elephants, which might be compared to the tanks of today.

The Brahmi inscriptions found all over India are undoubtedly the basic script from which devanagari and others have arisen in India.

Of.

One book of inestimable value is Kautilya’s Arthashashtra of the fourth century BC, which gives details of the political, social, economic, and military organization of the Maurya Empire.

If anything goes wrong the fault must lie with the king. There was a council of ministers and there are also references to some kind of State assembly. Nevertheless the king was an autocratic monarch though he had to function within established conventions. The high priest had an important position in court as an adviser and person in charge of religious ceremonies.

There are references to popular revolts against unjust and tyrannical kings, who are sometimes put to death for their crimes.

Probably this tax was about one-sixth of the produce. It was predominantly an agricultural civilization.

There was a colony of Indian merchants living at Memphis in Egypt about the fifth century BC as the discovery of modelled heads of Indians there has shown. Probably there was trade also between India and the islands of South-East Asia.

In mathematics the ancient Indians made some epoch-making discoveries, notably that of the zero sign, of the decimal place-value system, of the use of the minus sign, and the use in algebra of letters of the alphabet to denote unknown quantities.

But in the north-west, near modern Peshawar, there was an ancient and famous university at Takshashila or Taxila. This was particularly noted for science, especially medicine, and the arts, and people went to it from distant parts of India. The Jatakas stories are full of instances of sons of nobles and Brahmins travelling, unattended and unarmed, to Taxila to be educated. Probably students came also from Central Asia and Afghanistan, as it was conveniently situated.

The legal position of women, according to Manu, the earliest exponent of the law, was definitely bad. They were always dependent on somebody—on the father, the husband, or the son. Almost they were treated, in law, as chattels.

The legal position of women, according to Manu, the earliest exponent of the law, was definitely bad. They were always dependent on somebody—on the father, the husband, or the son. Almost they were treated, in law, as chattels. And yet from the numerous stories in the Epics this law was not applied very rigidly and they held an honoured place in the home and in society. The old law-giver, Manu, himself says: ‘Where women are honoured the gods dwell’. There is no mention of women students at Taxila or any of the old universities; but some of them did function as students somewhere, for there is repeated mention of learned and scholarly women.

Bad as the legal position of women was in ancient India, judged by modern standards, it was far better than in ancient Greece and Rome, in early Christianity, in the Canon Law of medieval Europe, and indeed right up to comparatively modern times at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

‘No nation,’ he writes, ‘is fonder of singing and dancing than the Indian.’.

Arrian, the Greek historian of Alexander’s campaign in North India, was struck by this light-heartedness of the race. ‘No nation,’ he writes, ‘is fonder of singing and dancing than the Indian.’.

Out of all this again grew the six systems of Indian philosophy.

Both Jainism and Buddhism were breakaways from the Vedic religion and its offshoots, though in a sense they had grown out of it. They deny the authority of the Vedas and, most fundamental of all matters, they deny or say nothing about the existence of a first cause. Both lay emphasis on non-violence, and build up organizations of celibate monks and priests. There is a certain realism and rationalism in their approach, though inevitably this does not carry us very far in our dealings with the invisible world. One of the fundamental doctrines of Jainism is that truth is relative to our standpoints. It is a rigorous ethical and non-transcendental system, laying a special emphasis on the ascetic aspect of life and thought.

Buddha had the courage to attack popular religion, superstition, ceremonial, and priestcraft, and all the vested interests that clung to them. He condemned also the metaphysical and theological outlook, miracles, revelations, and dealings with the supernatural. His appeal was to logic, reason, and experience; his emphasis was on ethics, and his method was one of psychological analysis, a psychology without a soul. His whole approach comes like the breath of the fresh wind from the mountains.

It is curious and significant that throughout the long span of Indian history there have been repeated warnings given by great men against priestcraft and the rigidity of the caste system, and powerful movements have risen against them; yet slowly, imperceptibly, almost, it seems, as if it were the inevitable course of destiny, caste has grown and spread and seized every aspect of Indian life in its strangling grip.

Rebels against caste have drawn many followers, and yet in course of time their group has itself become a caste. Jainism, a rebel against the parent religion and in many ways utterly different from it, was yet tolerant to caste and adapted itself to it; and so it survives and continues in India, almost as an offshoot of Hinduism. Buddhism, not adapting itself to caste, and more independent in its thought and outlook, ultimately passes away from India, though it influences India and Hinduism profoundly.

‘If a king is energetic, his subjects will be equally energetic.’.

‘Never in this world does hatred cease by hatred; hatred ceases by love.’ And ‘Let a man overcome anger by kindness, evil by good.’.

‘One may overcome a thousand men in battle, but he who conquers himself is the greatest victor.’.

‘Not by birth, but by his conduct alone, does a man become a low-caste or a Brahmin.’.

‘who would willingly use hard speech to those who have done a sinful deed, strewing salt, as.

‘who would willingly use hard speech to those who have done a sinful deed, strewing salt, as it were, upon the wound of their fault?’.

Consequences—‘Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy.’.

So also Buddha gives no clear answer about the existence of the soul. He does not deny it and he does not affirm it. He refuses to discuss this question, which is very remarkable, for the Indian mind of his day was full of the individual soul and the absolute soul, of monism and monotheism and other metaphysical hypotheses.

The river flows continuously and appears to be the same from moment to moment, yet the waters are ever changing.

So also fire. The flame keeps glowing and even maintains its shape and form, yet it is never the same flame and it changes every instant. So everything continually changes and life in all its forms is a stream of becoming. Reality is not something that is permanent and unchanging, but rather a kind of radiant energy, a thing of forces and movements, a succession of sequences.

The idea of time is just ‘a notion abstracted by mere usage from this or that event.’ We cannot say that one thing is the cause of something else for there is no core of permanent being which changes.

There is an emphasis on the pain and suffering of life, and the ‘Four Noble Truths’ which Buddha enunciated deal with this suffering, its cause, the possibility of ending it, and the way to do it. Speaking to his disciples, he is reported to have said: ‘and while ye experienced this (sorrow) through long ages, more tears have flowed from you and have been shed by you, while ye strayed and wandered on this pilgrimage (of life), and sorrowed and wept, because that was your portion which ye abhorred, and that which ye loved was not your portion, than all the water which is in the four great oceans.’.

It was the extinction of false desire, and not just annihilation, but it cannot be described by us except in negative terms.

Edwin Arnold’s Light of Asia became one of my favourite books.

When I visited countries where Buddhism is still a living and dominant faith, I went to see the temples and the monasteries and met monks and laymen, and tried to make out what Buddhism had done to the people. How had it influenced them, what impress had it left on their minds and faces, how did they react to modern life? There was much I did not like.

Despite Buddha’s warning, they had deified him, and his huge images, in the temples and elsewhere, looked down upon me and I wondered what he would have thought.

There was a look of peace and calm on the faces of many of the monks, a dignity, a gentleness, an air of detachment and freedom from the cares of the world. Did all this accord with life today, or was it a mere escape from it? Could it not be fitted into life’s ceaseless struggle and tone down the vulgarity and acquisitiveness and violence that afflict us?.

The contacts between India and the western world which Chandragupta Maurya had established continued during the reign of his son, Bindusara.

The old dream of uniting the whole of India under one supreme government fired Ashoka and forthwith he undertook the conquest of Kalinga on the east coast, which corresponds roughly with modern Orissa and part of Andhra. His armies triumphed in spite of the brave and obstinate resistance of the people of Kalinga. There was a terrible slaughter in this war, and when news of this reached Ashoka he was stricken with remorse and disgusted with war.

His messengers and ambassadors went to Syria, Egypt, Macedonia, Cyrene and Epirus, conveying his greeting and Buddha’s message. They went to Central Asia also and to Burma and Siam, and he sent his own son and daughter, Mahendra and Sanghamitra, to Ceylon in the south. Everywhere an appeal was made to the mind and the heart; there was no force or compulsion. Ardent Buddhist as he was, he showed respect and consideration for all other faiths. He proclaimed in an edict: ‘All sects deserve reverence for one reason or another. By thus acting a man exalts his own sect and at the same time does service to the sects of other people.’.

Buddhism spread rapidly in India from Kashmir to Ceylon. It penetrated into Nepal and later reached Tibet and China and Mongolia. In India, one of the consequences of this was the growth of vegetarianism and abstention from alcoholic drinks. Till then both Brahmins and Kshatriyas often ate meat and took wine. Animal sacrifice was forbidden.

Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines almost alone, a star. From the Volga to Japan his name is still honoured. China, Tibet, and even India, though it has left his doctrine, preserve the tradition of his greatness. More living men cherish his memory today than have ever heard the names of Constantine or Charlemagne.

Buddhism, child of Indian thought, had its nationalist background also. India was to it the holy land where Buddha had lived and preached and died, where famous scholars and saints had spread the faith. But Buddhism was essentially international, a world religion, and as it developed and spread it became increasingly so. Thus it was natural for the old Brahminic faith to become the symbol again and again of nationalist revivals.

Southern India was especially noted for its fine products and its trade by sea. They were sea-powers and their ships carried merchandise to distant countries.

The Mauryas, the Kushans, the Guptas, and, in the south, the Andhras, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and others, each lasted for two or three hundred years—longer, as a rule, than the British Empire has so far lasted in India.

Considered essential for the defeat of the enemy. It is interesting to note that Chanakya in his Arthashastra,.

It is interesting to note that Chanakya in his Arthashastra, in discussing weapons of warfare, mentions machines which can destroy a hundred persons at one time and also some kind of explosives. He also refers to trench warfare. What all this meant it is not possible to say now. Probably the reference is to some traditional stories of magical exploits. There is no ground for thinking that gunpowder is meant.

When they broke away and opposed the whole drift of national development, they weakened and their empire went to pieces.

We have been an exclusive people, proud of our past and of our heritage and trying to build walls and barriers to preserve it. Yet in spite of our race-consciousness and the growing rigidity of caste, we have, like others who take such pride in the purity of their racial stock, developed into a strange mixture of races—Aryan, Dravidian, Turanian, Semitic, and Mongolian.

In India also the past has always been glorified.

It is interesting to note that while Indian philosophy is highly individualistic and deals almost entirely with the individual’s growth to some kind of inner perfection, the Indian social structure was communal and paid attention to groups only.

The individual was allowed perfect freedom to think and believe what he liked, but he had to conform strictly to social and communal usage.

“The Iranians and Indians are like two brothers, who, according to a Persian legend, had got separated from each other, one going east and the other to the west. Their families had forgotten all about each other and the only thing that remained in common between them were the snatches of a few old tunes which they still played on their flutes. It was through these tunes that, after a lapse of centuries, the two families recognized each other and were reunited. So also we come to India to play on our flutes our age-old songs, so that, hearing them, our Indian cousins may recognize us as their own and become reunited with their Iranian cousins.’.

It is not some secret doctrine or esoteric knowledge that has kept India vital and going through these long ages, but a tender humanity, a varied and tolerant culture, and a deep understanding of life and its mysterious ways. Her abundant vitality flows out from age to age in her magnificent literature and art, though we have only a small part of this with us and much lies hidden still or has been destroyed by nature or man’s vandalism.

The Trimurti, in the Elephanta caves, might well be the many-faced statue of India herself, powerful, with compelling eyes, full of deep knowledge and understanding, looking down upon us.

The Ajanta frescoes are full of a tenderness and love of beauty and life, and yet always with a suspicion of something deeper, something beyond.

There were some mountains in Greece also, and the Greeks chose Olympus as the abode of the gods, just as the Indians placed their gods and even their sages on the Himalayan heights.

After the collapse of classical civilization in Europe it was the Arabs who kept the flame of scientific knowledge alight through the Middle Ages.

It is an interesting thought that image worship came to India from Greece.

The Vedic religion was opposed to all forms of idol and image worship.

Early Buddhism was strongly opposed to it and there was a special prohibition against the making of images and statues of the Buddha.

Even so, no statues of the Buddha were made to begin with, but Apollo-like statues of the Bodhisattvas (supposed to be the previous incarnations of the Buddha) appeared.

The human mind appears to have a passion for finding out some kind of unity in life, in nature and the universe. That desire, whether it is justified or not, must fulfil some essential need of the mind.

Have at their back the search for unity and harmony.

Kalidasa is acknowledged to be the greatest poet and dramatist of Sanskrit literature.

The former half is a description of external nature, yet interwoven with human feeling; the latter half is a picture of a human heart, yet the picture is framed in natural beauty. So exquisitely is the thing done that none can say which half is superior. Of those who read this perfect poem in the original text, some are moved by the one, some by the other. Kalidasa understood in the fifth century what Europe did not learn until the nineteenth, and even now comprehends only imperfectly, that the world was not made for man, that man reaches his full stature only as he realizes the dignity and worth of life that is not human. That Kalidasa seized this truth is a magnificent tribute to his intellectual power, a quality quite as necessary to great poetry as perfection of form. Poetical fluency is not rare; intellectual grasp is not very uncommon: but the combination of the two has not been found perhaps more than a dozen times since the world began. Because he possessed this harmonious combination, Kalidasa ranks not with Anacreon and Horace and Shelley, but with Sophocles, Virgil, and Milton.

The essential basis of the Greek drama is tragedy, the problem of evil. Why does man suffer? Why is there evil in the world? The enigma of religion, of God. What a pitiful thing is man, child of a day, with his blind and aimless strivings against all-powerful fate—‘The Law that abides and changes not, ages long …’ Man must learn by suffering and, if he is fortunate, he will rise above his striving:.

Happy be, on the weary sea Who hath fled the tempest and won the haven.

Happy be, on the weary sea Who hath fled the tempest and won the haven. Happy whoso has risen, free, Above his striving. For strangely graven Is the art of life that one and another In gold and power may outpass his brother. And men in their millions float and flow. And seethe with a million hopes as leaven; And they win their Will, or they miss their Will, And the hopes are dead or are pined for still; But whoever can know, As the long days go, That to Live is happy, hath found his Heaven!.

Man learns by suffering, he learns how to face life, but he learns also that the ultimate mystery remains and he cannot find an answer to his questions or solve the riddle of good and evil.

There be many shapes of mystery; And many things God brings to be, Past hope or fear. And the end men looked for cometh not, And a path is there where no man thought.

Sanskrit is a language amazingly rich, efflorescent, full of luxuriant growth of all kinds, and yet precise and strictly keeping within the framework of grammar which Panini.

Sanskrit is a language amazingly rich, efflorescent, full of luxuriant growth of all kinds, and yet precise and strictly keeping within the framework of grammar which Panini laid down two thousand six hundred years ago.

‘The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin and more exquisitely refined than either: yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs, and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all without believing them to have sprung from some common source which perhaps no longer exists …’.

Practically every German university had a Sanskrit department, with one or two professors in charge of it.

A language is something infinitely greater than grammar and philology. It is the poetic testament of the genius of a race and a culture, and the living embodiment of the thoughts and fancies that have moulded them.

A language is something infinitely greater than grammar and philology. It is the poetic testament of the genius of a race and a culture, and the living embodiment of the thoughts and fancies that have moulded them. Words change their meanings from age to age and old ideas transform themselves into new, often keeping their old attire. It is difficult to capture the meaning, much less the spirit, of an old word or phrase.

I believe that Sanskrit is more widely understood in India than Latin was in Europe at the time of Dante.’.

Have no idea of the number of people who understood Latin in the Europe of Dante’s time; nor do I know how many understand Sanskrit in India today; but the number of these latter is still large, especially in the south. Simple spoken Sanskrit is not very difficult to follow for those who know well any of the present-day Indo-Aryan languages—Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, etc. Even present-day Urdu, itself wholly an Indo-Aryan language, probably contains 80 per cent words derived from Sanskrit.

Prevented the normal growth of the modern Indian languages.

This continuing use of Sanskrit has undoubtedly prevented the normal growth of the modern Indian languages. The educated intellectuals looked upon them as vulgar tongues not suited to any creative or learned work, which was written in Sanskrit, or later not infrequently in Persian. In spite of this handicap the great provincial languages gradually took shape in the course of centuries, developed literary forms, and built up their literatures.

Buddha had repeatedly warned his people against learned controversy over metaphysical problems. ‘Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent,’ he is reported to have said.

Truth was to be found in life itself and not in argument about matters outside the scope of life and therefore beyond the ken of the human intellect.

Thought cannot know itself and cannot go outside itself or know another. There is no God apart from the universe, and no universe apart from God, and both are equally appearances.

The very name of the province of Bihar today is derived from Vihara, monastery, which indicates how full that huge area must have been of monasteries.

Eight or nine years ago, when I was in Paris, André Malraux put me a strange question at the very beginning of our conversation. What was it, he asked me, that enabled Hinduism to push away organized Buddhism from India, without any major conflict, over a thousand years ago? How did Hinduism succeed in absorbing, as it were, a great and widespread popular religion, without the usual wars of religion which disfigure the history of so many countries? What inner vitality or strength did Hinduism possess then which enabled it to perform this remarkable feat? And did India possess this inner vitality and strength today? If so, then her freedom and greatness were assured.

Even when Buddhism was at its height in India, Hinduism was widely prevalent.

Buddhism died a natural death in India, or rather it was a fading out and a transformation into something else.

‘India,’ says Keith, ‘has a strange genius for converting what it borrows and assimilating it.’.

Buddhism was not only entirely a product of India; its philosophy was in line with previous Indian thought and the philosophy of the Vedanta (the Upanishads).

The Upanishads had even ridiculed priestcraft and ritualism and minimised the importance of caste.

Brahminism and Buddhism acted and reacted on each other, and in spite of their dialectical conflicts or because of them, approached nearer to each other, both in the realm of philosophy and that of popular belief.

Brahminism made of Buddha an avatar, a God. So did Buddhism. The Mahayana doctrine spread rapidly but it lost in quality and distinctiveness what it gained in extent. The monasteries became rich, centres of vested interests, and their discipline became lax. Magic and superstition crept into the popular forms of worship. There was a progressive degeneration of Buddhism in India after the first millenium of its existence.

But both Brahminism and Buddhism deteriorated and degrading practices grew up in them.

Brahminism absorbed Buddhism, this process changed Brahminism also in many ways.

It became difficult to distinguish the two. If Brahminism absorbed Buddhism, this process changed Brahminism also in many ways.

In the eighth century Shankaracharya, one of the greatest of India’s philosophers, started religious orders or maths for Hindu sanyasins or monks. This was an adoption of the old Buddhist practice of the sangha. Previously there had been no such organizations of sanyasins in Brahminism, although small groups of them existed.

‘In India,’ says Havell, ‘religion is hardly a dogma, but a working hypothesis of human conduct, adapted to different stages of spiritual development and different conditions of life. A dogma might continue to be believed in, isolated from life, but a working hypothesis of human conduct must work and conform to life, or it obstructs life. The very raison d’etre of such a hypothesis is its workableness, its conformity to life, and its capacity to adapt itself to changing conditions. So long as it can do so it serves its purpose and performs its allotted function.

‘To know Indian art in India alone,’ says Sir John Marshall, ‘is to know but half its story. To apprehend it to the full, we must follow it in the wake of Buddhism, to Central Asia, China, and Japan; we must watch it assuming new forms and breaking into new beauties as it spreads over Tibet and Burma and Siam; we must gaze in awe at the unexampled grandeur of its creations in Cambodia and Java.

In each of these countries, Indian art encounters a different racial genius, a different local environment, and under their modifying influence it takes on a different garb.’27 Indian art is so intimately associated with.

The Greeks loved beauty for its own sake and found not only joy but truth in it; the ancient Indians loved beauty also but always they sought to put some deeper significance in their work, some vision of the inner truth as they saw it.

It is India that gave us the ingenious method of expressing all numbers by means of ten symbols, each symbol receiving a value of position, as well as an absolute value; a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit, but its very simplicity, the great ease which it has lent to all computations, puts our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions; and we shall appreciate the grandeur of this achievement when we remember that it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest men produced by antiquity.

Ramanujam’s brief life and death are symbolic of conditions in India. Of our millions how few get any education at all, how many live on the verge of starvation; of even those who get some education how many have nothing to look forward to but a clerkship in some office on a pay that is usually far less than the unemployment dole in England. If life opened its gates to them and offered them food and healthy conditions of living and education and opportunities of growth, how many among these millions would be eminent scientists, educationists, technicians, industrialists, writers and artists, helping to build a new India and a new world?.

The Nyaya method is analytic and logical.

Yoga is a word well known now in Europe and America, though little understood, and it is associated with quaint practices, more especially with sitting Buddha-like and gazing on one’s navel or the tip of one’s nose.14 Some people learning odd tricks of the body presume to become authorities on the subject in the West, and impress and exploit the credulous and the seekers after the sensational. The system is much more than these devices and is based on the psychological conception that by proper training of the mind certain higher levels of consciousness can be reached. It is meant to be a method for finding out things for oneself rather than a preconceived metaphysical theory of reality or of the universe.

‘If the government gets hold of you, they’ll flog you to death; if the Buddhists get hold of you, they’ll starve you to death!’.

To know and understand India one has to travel far in time and space, to forget for a while her present condition with all its misery and narrowness and horror, and to have glimpses of what she was and what she did. ‘To know my country’, wrote Rabindranath Tagore, ‘one has to travel to that age, when she realized her soul and thus transcended her physical boundaries, when she revealed her being in a radiant magnanimity which illumined the eastern horizon, making her recognized as their own by those in alien shores who were awakened into a surprise of life; and not now when she has withdrawn herself into a narrow barrier of obscurity, into a miserly pride of exclusiveness, into a poverty of mind that dumbly revolves around itself in an unmeaning repetition of a past that has lost its.

It was the old tradition of India to be tolerant to all faiths and forms of worship.

What this was I do not know but the word inevitably makes one think of the Arab word for Buddhists—Samani, which was derived from the Sanskrit Shravana.

To call God benevolent or righteous was, it was suggested, just as pagan and degraded as to say that He has a beard.

Prithvi Raj is a popular hero, still famous in song and legend, for reckless lovers are always popular. He had carried away the girl he loved and who loved him from the very palace of her father, Jaichandra, King of Kanauj, defying an assembled host of princelings who had come to offer court to her. He won his bride for a brief while, but at the cost of a bitter feud with a powerful ruler and the lives of the bravest on both sides. The chivalry of Delhi and central India engaged in internecine conflict and there was much mutual slaughter. And so, all for the love of a woman, Prithvi Raj lost his life and throne, and Delhi, that seat of empire, passed into the hands of an invader from outside. But his love story is sung still and he is a hero, while Jaichandra is looked upon almost as a traitor.

Indian history has usually been divided by English as well as some Indian historians into three major periods: Ancient or Hindu, Muslim, and the British period.

Him for it. The Hara chief replied to the Lodi King: ‘There are three things you must not ask of a Rajput: his horse, his mistress, or his sword’,.

Among the unfortunate developments that took place in India was the growth of purdah or the seclusion of women. Why this should have been so is not clear but somehow it did result from the interaction of the new elements on the old. In India there had been previously some segregation of the sexes among the aristocracy, as in many other countries and notably in ancient Greece. Some such segregation existed in ancient Iran also and to some extent all over western Asia. But nowhere was there any strict seclusion of women. Probably this started in the Byzantine court circles where eunuchs were employed to guard the women’s apartments. Byzantine influence travelled to Russia where there was a fairly strict seclusion of women right up to Peter the Great’s time. This had nothing to do with the Tartars who, it is well established, did not segregate their women-folk.

Sir George Birdwood has said somewhere: ‘So long as the Hindus hold to the caste system, India will be India; but from the day they break from it, there will be no more India. That glorious peninsula will be degraded to the position of a bitter “East End” of the Anglo-Saxon Empire.’.

Some old inscriptions further tell us how the members of the village councils were elected and what their qualifications and disqualifications were. Various committees were formed, elected annually, and women could serve on them. In case of misbehaviour, a member could be removed. A member could be disqualified if he failed to render accounts of public funds. An interesting rule to prevent nepotism is mentioned: near relatives of members were not to be appointed to public office.

These village councils were very jealous of their liberties and it was laid down that no soldier could enter the village unless he had a royal permit. If the people complained of an official, the Nitisara says that the king ‘should take the side, not of his officers, but of his subjects’.

‘When a ruler treats his subjects like grass and dirt, then subjects should treat him as a bandit and an enemy.’.

There was plenty of land available and there was no advantage in dispossessing the peasant. Thus in India there was no landlord system, as known in the west, nor was the individual peasant the full owner of his patch of land. Both these concepts were introduced much later by the British with disastrous results.

Nevertheless the Afghan and Mughal riders took special care not to interfere with old customs and conventions and no fundamental changes were introduced, and the economic and social structure of Indian life continued as before.

‘In India’, says Havell, ‘religion is hardly a dogma, but a working hypothesis of human conduct adapted in different stages of spiritual development and different conditions of life.’.

This has led to one good consequence and many bad ones. The good one is bodily cleanliness. A daily bath has always been an essential feature of a Hindu’s life, including most of the depressed classes. It was from India that this habit spread to England and elsewhere.

When that religious sanction goes, there is marked deterioration in the standards of cleanliness.

The evil consequence of ceremonial purity was a growth of exclusiveness, touch-me-notism, and of not eating and drinking with people of other castes.

Interdining was taboo, much more so was intermarriage between castes. Some mixed marriages inevitably took place but on the whole it is extraordinary how much each caste kept to itself and propagated its own kind. The continuation of racial identity through long ages is an illusion and yet the caste system in India has to some extent managed to preserve distinctive types, especially among the higher castes.

The joint property was supposed to provide for the needs of all the members of the family, workers or non-workers. Inevitably this meant a guaranteed minimum for all of them, rather than high rewards for some.

The beginnings of a mixed culture began to appear and foundations were laid on which Akbar was to build.

His grandfather, Babar, had won the throne of Delhi in 1526, but he was a stranger to India and continued to feel so. He had come from the north, where the Timurid Renaissance was flourishing in his homelands in Central Asia and the influence of the art and culture of Iran was strong. He missed the friendly society he was used to, the delights of conversation, the amenities and refinements of life which had spread from Baghdad and Iran. He longed for the snow and ice of the northern highlands, for the good flesh and flowers and fruits of Ferghana. Yet, with all his disappointment at what he saw, he says that Hindustan is a remarkably fine country.

This class had fewer intimate contacts with the Muslims than any other class, above it or below.

The Indians were the Marathas and Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the south; the foreigners were the British and the French. Of these, it appeared almost inevitable, during the.

The Indians were the Marathas and Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the south; the foreigners were the British and the French.

The second consequence of Nadir Shah’s raid was the separation of Afghanistan from India.

Bengal, Clive, by promoting treason and forgery and with very little fighting, had won the battle of Plassey in 1757, a date which is sometimes said to mark the beginning of the British empire in India.

Of that bitter taste has clung to it ever since. Soon the British held the whole of Bengal and Bihar and one of the early consequences of their ride was a terrible famine which ravaged these two provinces in 1770, killing over a third of the population of this rich, vast, and densely populated area.

Haider Ali was a remarkable man and one of the notable figures in Indian history. He had some kind of a national ideal and possessed the qualities of a leader with vision.

Looking back over this period, it almost seems that the British succeeded in dominating India by a succession of fortuitous circumstances and lucky flukes.

With remarkably little effort, considering the glittering prize, they won a great empire and enormous wealth, which helped to make them the leading power in the world. It seems easy for a slight turn in events to have taken place which would have dashed their hopes and ended their ambitions.

They were defeated on many occasions—by Haider Ali and Tipu, by the Marathas, by the Sikhs, and by the Gurkhas. A little less good fortune and they might have lost their foothold in India, or at the most held on to certain coastal territories only.

Seems clear that India became a prey to foreign conquest because of the inadequacy of her own people and because the British represented a higher and advancing social order.

Another but a different type of Indian statesman was Sawai Jai Singh, of Jaipur in Rajputana. He belongs to a somewhat earlier period and he died in 1773. He lived during the period of disruption following Aurungzeb’s death. He was clever and opportunist enough to survive the many shocks and changes that followed each other in quick succession. He acknowledged the suzerainty of the Delhi Emperor. When he found that the advancing Marathas were too strong to be checked, he came to terms with them on behalf of the Emperor. But it is not his political or military career that interests me. He was a brave warrior and an accomplished diplomat, but he was something much more than this. He was a mathematician and an astronomer, a scientist and a town planner, and he was interested in the study of history.

Jai Singh built big observatories at Jaipur, Delhi, Ujjain, Benares, and Mathura. Learning through Portuguese.

Jai Singh built big observatories at Jaipur, Delhi, Ujjain, Benares, and Mathura. Learning through Portuguese missionaries of the progress of astronomy in Portugal, he sent his own men, with one of the missionaries, to the court of the Portuguese King Emmanuel. Emmanuel sent his envoy, Xavier de Silva, with De la Hire’s tables to Jai Singh. On comparing these with his own tables, Jai Singh came to the conclusion that the Portuguese tables were less exact and had several errors. He attributed these.

Emmanuel sent his envoy, Xavier de Silva, with De la Hire’s tables to Jai Singh. On comparing these with his own tables, Jai Singh came to the conclusion that the Portuguese tables were less exact and had several errors. He attributed these to the ‘inferior diameters’ of the instruments used.

He founded the city of Jaipur. Interested in town planning, he collected the plans of many European cities of the time and then drew up his own plan. Many of these plans of the old European cities of the time are preserved in the Jaipur museum. The city of Jaipur was so well and wisely planned that it is still considered a model of town planning.

The fact that he rose and functioned as a scientist in the typically feudal milieu of Rajputana and during one of the darkest periods of Indian history, when disruption and war and tumults filled the scene, is very significant.

‘The government of an exclusive company of merchants is perhaps the worst of all governments for any country whatever.’.

England came to India. When Queen Elizabeth gave a charter to the East India Company in 1600, Shakespeare was alive and writing. In 1611 the Authorized English edition of the Bible was issued; in 1608 Milton was born. There followed Hampden and Cromwell and the political revolution. In 1660 the Royal Society of England, which was to advance the cause of science so much, was organized. A hundred years later, in 1760, the flying shuttle was invented and there followed in quick succession the spinning jenny, the steam engine, and the power loom.

Which of these two Englands came to India? The England of Shakespeare and Milton, of noble speech and writing and brave deed, of political revolution and the struggle for freedom, of science and technical progress, or the England of the savage penal code and brutal behaviour, of entrenched feudalism and reaction? For there were two Englands, just as in every country there are these two aspects of national character and civilization. ‘The discrepancy in England,’ writes Edward Thompson, ‘between the highest and the ordinary levels of our civilization, has always been immense; I doubt if there is anything like it in any country with which we should wish to be compared and it is a discrepancy that lessens so slowly that it often seems hardly to lessen at all.’14.

History is almost always written by the victors and conquerors and gives their viewpoint; or, at any rate the victors’ version is given prominence and holds the field.

Truth hides somewhere at the bottom of the deepest well and falsehood, naked and unashamed, reigns almost supreme.

In our own day Lenin was a monster and a brigand to many English stateman of high repute, yet millions have considered him as a saviour and the greatest man of the age.

Authority corrupts and absolute authority corrupts absolutely,.

Authority corrupts and absolute authority corrupts absolutely, and no man in the wide world today has had or has such absolute authority over such large numbers of people as the British Viceroy of India.

Direct result of British policy: the princes; the minority problem; various vested interests, foreign and Indian; the lack of industry and the neglect of agriculture; the extreme backwardness in the social services; and, above all, the tragic poverty of the people. The attitude to education has been significant. In Kaye’s Life of Metcalfe it is stated that ‘this dread of the free diffusion of knowledge became a chronic disease … continually afflicting the members of Government with all sorts of hypochondriacal day-dreams and nightmares, in which visions of the printing press and the Bible were making their flesh creep, and their hair to stand erect with horror. It was our policy in those days to keep the natives of India in the profoundest state of barbarism and darkness, and every attempt to diffuse the light of knowledge among the people, either of our own or of the independent states, was vehemently opposed and resented.’.

About fifteen of these may be considered major states, the biggest of these being Hyderabad, Kashmir, Mysore, Travancore, Baroda, Gwalior, Indore, Cochin, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Bhopal and Patiala.

Even the British Government, in spite of its dislike of education, was compelled by circumstances to arrange for the training and production of clerks for its growing establishment.

The best and noblest gifts of humanity cannot be the monopoly of a particular race or country; its scope may not be limited nor may it be regarded as the miser’s hoard buried underground.

Since Hitler emerged from obscurity and became the Fuehrer of Germany, we have heard a great deal about racialism and the nazi theory of the herrenvolk.

As an Indian, I am ashamed to write all this, for the memory of it hurts, and what hurts still more is the fact that we submitted for so long to this degradation. I would have preferred any kind of resistance to this, whatever the consequences, rather than that our people should endure this treatment.

Among the Muslims the most prominent sects in business and industry are the Khojas, Memons, and Bohras. All of these are converts from Hinduism, and all come from Gujrat, Kathiawar, or Cutch.

‘Liberty of thought and action is the only condition in life, of growth and well-being. Where it does not exist, the man, the race, the nation must go.’.

Am thoroughly convinced that no individual or nation can live by holding itself apart from the community of others, and wherever such an attempt has been made under false ideas of greatness, policy or holiness—the result has always been disastrous to the secluding one.’.

He once wrote: ‘I am a socialist not because I think it is a perfect system, but half a loaf is better than no bread. The other systems have been tried and found wanting. Let this one be tried—if for nothing else, for the novelty of the thing.’.

Vivekananda spoke of many things but the one constant refrain of his speech and writing was abhay—be fearless, be strong. For him man was no miserable sinner but a part of divinity; why should he be afraid of anything? ‘If there is a sin in the world it is weakness; avoid all weakness, weakness is sin, weakness is death.’.

Tagore, the aristocratic artist, turned democrat with proletarian sympathies, represented essentially the cultural tradition of India, the tradition of accepting life in the fullness thereof and going through it with song and dance.

Gandhi, more a man of the people, almost the embodiment of the Indian peasant, represented the other ancient tradition of India, that of renunciation and asceticism.

British policy was inclined to be pro-Hindu and anti-Muslim, except in the Punjab, where Muslims took more easily to Western education than elsewhere.

It is significant that Akbar, whom the Hindus especially admired, has not been approved of in recent years by some Muslims. Last year the 400th anniversary of his birth was celebrated in India. All classes of people, including many Muslims, joined, but the Muslim League kept aloof because Akbar was a symbol of India’s unity.

One of the declared objects of the Aligarh College he founded was ‘to make the Mussulmans of India worthy and useful subjects of the British crown’. He was not opposed to the National Congress because he considered it predominantly a Hindu organization; he opposed it because he thought it was politically too aggressive (though it was mild enough in those days), and he wanted British help and co-operation. He tried to show that Muslims as a whole had not rebelled during the Mutiny and that many had remained loyal to the British power.

He was in no way anti-Hindu or communally separatist. Repeatedly he emphasized that religious differences should have no political or national significance. ‘Do you not inhabit the same land?’ he said. ‘Remember that the words Hindu and Mohammedan are only meant for religious distinction; otherwise all persons, whether Hindu or Mohammedan, even the Christians who reside in this country, are all in this particular respect belonging to one and the same nation.’.

A little before I left him he said to me: ‘What is there in common between Jinnah and you? He is a politician, you are a patriot.’ I hope there is still much in common between Mr Jinnah and me. As for my being a patriot I do not know that this is a particular qualification in these days, as least in the limited sense of the word. Greatly attached as I am to India, I have long felt that something more than national attachment is necessary for us in order to understand and solve even our own problems, and much more so those of the world as a whole. But Iqbal was certainly right in holding that I was not much of a politician, although politics had seized me and made me its victim.

We did not grow much more truthful perhaps than we had been previously, but Gandhi was always there as a symbol of uncompromising truth to pull us up and shame us into truth. What is truth? I do not know for certain, and perhaps our truths are relative and absolute truth is beyond us. Different persons may and do take different views of truth, and each individual is powerfully influenced by his own background, training, and impulses. So also Gandhi. But truth is at least for an individual what he himself feels and knows to be true. According to this definition I do not know of any person who holds to the truth as Gandhi does. That is a dangerous quality in a politician, for he speaks out his mind and even lets the public see its changing phases.

A very few fell away and among them was Mr M.A. Jinnah. He left the Congress not because of any difference of opinion on the Hindu-Muslim question but because he could not adapt himself to the new and more advanced ideology, and even more so because he disliked the crowds of id-dressed people, talking in Hindustani, who idled the Congress. His idea of politics was of a superior variety, more suited to the legislative chamber or to a committee-room. For some years he felt completely out of the picture and even decided to leave India for good. He settled.

‘Indian culture,’ he wrote, ‘is neither Hindu, Islamic, nor any other, wholly. It is a fusion of all.’ Again he said: ‘I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other peoples’ houses as an interloper, a beggar, or a slave.’ Influenced by modern thought currents, he never let go of his roots and clung to them tenaciously.

‘For millions it is an eternal vigil or an eternal trance.’ His ambition, he said, was ‘to wipe every tear from every eye.’.

Is easy to be wise after the event, but I am still inclined to think.

It is easy to be wise after the event, but I am still inclined to think that politically, and situated as we were then, it was a natural and logical decision for us.

Sunnis are in a majority in India and in the Islamic countries, except in Iran, where Shias are in a majority.

Speeches and in some newspapers became marked. A Congress Muslim minister was stabbed and there was no condemnation of this from any Muslim League leader; in fact it was condoned. Other exhibitions of violence frequently took place.

The small Parsee community has also produced outstanding leaders of modern industry. Mr Jinnah’s family, it is interesting to note, was originally Hindu.

Mr Jinnah’s demand was based on a new theory he had recently propounded—that India consisted of two nations, Hindu and Muslim. Why only two I do not know, for if nationality was based on religion, then there were many nations in India. Of two brothers one may be a Hindu, another a Muslim; they would belong to two different nations. These two nations existed in varying proportions in most of the villages of India. They were nations which had no boundaries; they overlapped. A Bengali Muslim and a Bengali Hindu living together, speaking the same language, and having much the same traditions and customs, belonged to different nations. Ali this was very difficult to grasp; it seemed a reversion to some medieval theory.

An approximate estimate of the average annual income per capita was Rs 65. This included the rich and the poor, the town-dweller, and the villager.

The Congress provincial governments were anxious to develop a power alcohol industry. This was desirable from many points of view, but there was an additional reason in the United Provinces and Bihar. The large numbers of sugar factories there were producing as a byproduct a vast quantity of molasses which was being treated as waste material. It was proposed to utilise this for the production of power alcohol. The process was simple, there was no difficulty, except one—the interests of the Shell and Burma Oil combine were affected. The Government of India championed these interests and refused to permit the manufacture of power alcohol. It was only in the third year of the present war, after Burma fell and the supplies of oil and petrol were cut off, that the realization came that power alcohol was necessary and must be produced in India.

Which have strong traditions of their own. In China I was greatly attracted to the Industrial Co-operatives—the Indusco movement—and it seems to me that some such movement is peculiarly suited to India. It would fit in with the Indian background, give a democratic basis to small industry, and develop the co-operative habit. It could be made to complement big industry. It must be remembered that, however rapid might be the development of heavy industry in India, a vast field will remain open to small and cottage industries. Even in Soviet Russia owner-producer co-operatives have played an important part in industrial growth.

The three fundamental requirements of India, if she is to develop industrially and otherwise, are a heavy engineering and machine-making industry, scientific research institutes, and electric power.

There was neither lack of capital nor skilled personnel in India, only machinery was lacking, and industrialists were clamouring for it.

Jamshedji Tata, the far-sighted founder of Tata Steel, had vision enough to start the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. This research institute was one of the very few of its kind in India; the others were some government institutions with limited objectives. The vast field of scientific and industrial research, which has thousands of institutes, academies, and special stations in the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, was thus almost wholly neglected in India, except for the Bangalore institute and some work done in the universities. An effort was made, some time after World War II started, to encourage research and, though limited in scope, it has produced good results.

Between England and Soviet Russia, however, there was a complete breach; there had been the Arcos raid and withdrawal of diplomatic representatives.

Always there has been that inner conflict within him and in our national politics, between Gandhi as a national leader and Gandhi as a man with a prophetic message, which was not confined to India but was for humanity and the world.

The accidents of geography have had a powerful effect on determining national character and history. The fact that India was cut off by the tremendous barrier of the Himalayas and by the sea produced a sense of unity in this wide area and at the same time bred exclusiveness.

The accidents of geography have had a powerful effect on determining national character and history. The fact that India was cut off by the tremendous barrier of the Himalayas and by the sea produced a sense of unity in this wide area and at the same time bred exclusiveness. Over this vast territory a vivid and homogeneous civilization grew up which had plenty of scope for expansion and development, and which continued to preserve a strong cultural unity. Yet within that unity geography again produced diversity. The huge northern and central plain differed from the hilly and variegated areas of the Deccan, and the people living in different geographical areas developed different characteristics. History also took a different course in the north and in the south, though often the two overlapped and joined hands. The flatness of the land, and the vast open spaces of the north, as in Russia, required powerful central governments for protection against external enemies. Empires flourished in the south as well as the north, but the north was ready the centre of empire and often dominated the south. A strong central government in the old days inevitably meant autocracy. It was not a mere accident of history that the Mughal Empire was broken up, among other causes, by the Marathas. The Marathas came from the hilly tracts of the Deccan, and had preserved some spirit of independence when the great majority of the dwellers on the northern plains had grown servile and submissive. The British had an easy victory in Bengal, and the people of the fertile plains there submitted with extraordinary docility. Having established themselves there they spread elsewhere. Geography counts still and must count in the future, but other factors play a more important role now. Mountains and seas are no longer barriers, but they still determine a people’s character and a country’s political and economic position. They cannot be ignored in considering new schemes of division, partition or re-merging, unless the planning is on a world scale.

Bernard Shaw has said that though he (Gandhi) may commit any number of tactical errors, his essential strategy continues to be right.

Not to break with the past, and yet not to live in it; realise the present and look to the future … To change the rhythm of life and make it in tune with this present and future. The cost of war was heavy, and the consequences full of uncertainty. That war was not of our seeking, but since it had come, it could be made to harden the fibre of the nation and provide those.

The cost of war was heavy, and the consequences full of uncertainty. That war was not of our seeking, but since it had come, it could be made to harden the fibre of the nation and provide those vital experiences out of which a new life might blossom forth. Vast numbers would die, that was inevitable, but it is better to die in war than through famine; it is better to die than to live a miserable, hopeless life. Out of death, life is born afresh, and individuals and nations who do not know how to die, do not know also how to live. ‘Only where there are graves are there resurrections’.

In China, it was evident that, whatever the reaction of the people to any particular action of ours, their sympathies were entirely on the side of Indian freedom. That sympathy had historical roots, but, even more so, it was based on the realization that unless India was free, China’s freedom might be endangered. It was not in China only but throughout Asia, Egypt, and the Middle East, Indian freedom had become a symbol of a larger freedom for other subject and dependent countries, a test in the present and a measuring rod for the future. Mr Wendell Wilkie in his book—One World—says:.

The stream of life goes on in spite of famine and war, full of its inherent contradictions, and finding sustenance even in those contradictions and the disasters that follow in their train. Nature renews itself and covers yesterday’s battlefield with flowers and green grass, and the blood that was shed feeds the soil and gives strength and colour to new life. Human beings with their unique quality of possessing memory live in their storied and remembered pasts and seldom catch up to the present in ‘The worlde that neweth every daie’. And that present slips into the past before we are hardly aware of it; today, child of yesterday, yields place to its own offspring, tomorrow. Winged victory ends in a welter of blood and mud; and out of the heavy trials of seeming defeat the spirit emerges with new strength and wider vision. The weak in spirit yield and are eliminated, but others carry the torch forward and hand it to the standard-bearers of tomorrow.

Indian civilization achieved much that it was aiming at, but, in that very achievement, life began to fade away, for it is too dynamic to exist for long in a rigid, unchanging environment. Even those basic principles, which are said to be unchanging, lose their freshness and reality when they are taken for granted and the search for them ceases. Ideas of truth, beauty, and freedom decay, and we become prisoners following a deadening routine.

The very thing India lacked, the modern West possessed, and possessed to excess. It had the dynamic outlook. It was engrossed in the changing world, caring little for ultimate principles, the unchanging, the universal. It paid little attention to duties and obligations and emphasized rights. It was active, aggressive, acquisitive, seeking power and domination, living in the present and ignoring the future consequences of its actions.

Our lives are encumbered with the dead wood of this past; all that is dead and has served its purpose has to go.

Religions have helped greatly in the development of humanity. They have laid down values and standards and have pointed out principles for the guidance of human life. But with all the good they have done, they have also tried to imprison truth in set forms and dogmas, and encouraged ceremonials and practices which soon lose all their original meaning and become mere routine.

But with all the good they have done, they have also tried to imprison truth in set forms and dogmas, and encouraged ceremonials and practices which soon lose all their original meaning and become mere routine. While impressing upon man the awe and mystery of the unknown that surrounds him on all sides, they have discouraged him from trying to understand not only the unknown but what might come in the way of social effort. Instead of encouraging curiosity and thought, they have preached a philosophy of submission to nature, to established churches, to the prevailing social order, and to everything that is. The belief in a supernatural agency which ordains everything has led to a certain irresponsibility on the social plane, and emotion and sentimentality have taken the place of reasoned thought and inquiry. Religion, though it has undoubtedly brought comfort to innumerable human beings and stabilized society by its values, has checked the tendency to change and progress inherent in human society.

Philosophy has avoided many of these pitfalls and encouraged thought and inquiry. But it has usually lived in its ivory tower, cut off from life and its day-today problems, concentrating on ultimate purposes and fading to link them with the life of man. Logic and reason were its guides and they took it far in many directions, but that logic was too much the product of the mind and unconcerned with fact.

Science ignored the ultimate purposes and looked at fact alone. It made the world jump forward with a leap, built up a glittering civilization, opened up innumerable avenues for the growth of knowledge, and added to the power of man to such an extent that for the first time it was possible to conceive that man could triumph over and shape his physical environment.

Science ignored the ultimate purposes and looked at fact alone. It made the world jump forward with a leap, built up a glittering civilization, opened up innumerable avenues for the growth of knowledge, and added to the power of man to such an extent that for the first time it was possible to conceive that man could triumph over and shape his physical environment. Man became almost a geological force, changing the face of the planet earth chemically, physically, and in many other ways. Yet when this sorry scheme of things entirely seemed to be in his grasp, to mould it nearer to the heart’s desire, there was some essential lack and some vital element was missing. There was no knowledge of ultimate purpose and not even an understanding of the immediate purpose, for science had told us nothing about any purpose in life. Nor did man, so powerful in his control of nature, have the power to control himself, and the monster he had created ran amok. Perhaps new developments in biology, psychology, and similar sciences, and the interpretation of biology and physics, may help man to understand and control himself more than he has done in the past. Or, before any such advances influence human life sufficiently, man may destroy the civilization he has built and have to start anew.

There is no visible limit to the advance of science, if it is given the chance to advance. Yet it may be that the scientific method of observation is not always applicable to all the varieties of human experience and cannot cross the uncharted ocean that surrounds us. With the help of philosophy it may go a little further and venture even on these high seas. And when both science and philosophy fail us, we shall have to rely on such other powers of apprehension as we may possess. For there appears to be a definite stopping place beyond which reason, as the mind is at present constituted, cannot go. ‘La dérniere démarche de la raison,’ says Pascal, ‘c’est de connaitre qu’il y a une infinite de choses qui la surpassent. Elle est bien faible si elle ne va jusque-la.’.

It is better to understand a part of truth and apply it to our lives, than to understand nothing at all and flounder helplessly in a vain attempt to pierce the mystery of existence.

Chinese society built up a balance and an equilibrium which survived through many changes for thousands of years. Perhaps one of the great advantages that China has had over other countries is her entire freedom from dogma, from the narrow and limited religious outlook, and her reliance on reason and common sense. No other country has based its culture less on religion and more on morality and ethics and a deep understanding of the variety of human life.

Specialization has led to a narrowing of individual life in a particular groove, and man’s labour in industry is often confined to some infinitesimal part of the whole product. Specialization in knowledge and work will have to.

Specialization has led to a narrowing of individual life in a particular groove, and man’s labour in industry is often confined to some infinitesimal part of the whole product. Specialization in knowledge and work will have to continue, but it seems more essential than ever that a synthetic view of human life and man’s adventure through the ages should be encouraged.

India must therefore lessen her religiosity and turn to science. She must get rid of the exclusiveness in thought and social habit which has become like a prison to her, stunting her spirit and preventing growth. The idea of ceremonial purity has erected barriers against social intercourse and narrowed the sphere of social action. The day-today religion of the orthodox Hindu is more concerned with what to eat and what not to eat, who to eat with and from whom to keep away, than with spiritual values. The rules and regulations of the kitchen dominate his social life. The Muslim is fortunately free from these inhibitions, but he has his own narrow codes and ceremonials, a routine which he rigorously follows, forgetting the lesson of brotherhood which his religion taught him. His view of life is, perhaps, even more limited and sterile than the Hindu view, though the average Hindu today is a poor representative of the latter view, for he has lost that traditional freedom of thought and the background that enriches life in many.

Caste is the symbol.

India must therefore lessen her religiosity and turn to science. She must get rid of the exclusiveness in thought and social habit which has become like a prison to her, stunting her spirit and preventing growth. The idea of ceremonial purity has erected barriers against social intercourse and narrowed the sphere of social action. The day-today religion of the orthodox Hindu is more concerned with what to eat and what not to eat, who to eat with and from whom to keep away, than with spiritual values. The rules and regulations of the kitchen dominate his social life.

‘The jail … acts as a magnifying glass on human character. Every tiny weakness is brought out, emphasized, wakened, until presently there is no more of the convict with the weakness but only a weakness wearing convict clothes.’.

May well create new problems.

The attempt to solve one problem in the wrong way may well create new problems.

It is a tale that is told, from which we may draw the knowledge and comprehension needed for the future. The disproportion between the quarrels of nations and the suffering which fighting out those quarrels involves; the poor and barren prizes which reward sublime endeavour on the battlefield; the fleeting triumph of war; the long, slow, rebuilding; the awful risks so hardly run; the doom missed by a hair’s breadth, by the spin of a coin, by the accident of an accident—all this should make the prevention of another great war the main preoccupation of mankind.

‘There is no power in the world more completely imbued with the idea of its dominance than the British empire. Even the word “empire” sticks in Mr Churchill’s throat every time he tries to utter it.’.

Life is a continuous struggle of man against man, of man against his surroundings, a struggle on the physical, intellectual, and moral plane out of which new things take shape and fresh ideas are born.

‘You can rob an army of its general,’ says Confucius, ‘but not the least of men of his will.’.

‘I am now convinced that no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.’.

But there must be an end to this wandering. If there was no other sufficient reason for it, there is a very practical consideration which cannot be ignored. I have almost exhausted the supply of paper that I had managed to secure after considerable difficulty and it is not easy to get more.

But there must be an end to this wandering. If there was no other sufficient reason for it, there is a very practical consideration which cannot be ignored. I have almost exhausted the supply of paper that I had managed to secure after considerable difficulty and it is not easy to get more of it.

It was presumptuous of me to imagine that I could unveil her and find out what she is today and what she was in the long past. Today she is four hundred million separate individual men and women, each differing from the other, each living in a private universe of thought and feeling. If this is so in the present, how much more difficult is it to grasp that multitudinous past of innumerable successions of human beings. Yet something has bound them together and binds them still. India is a geographical and economic entity, a cultural unity amidst diversity, a bundle of contradictions held together by strong but invisible threads. Overwhelmed again and again, her spirit was never conquered, and today when she appears to be the plaything of a proud conqueror, she remains unsubdued and unconquered. About her there is the elusive quality of a legend of long ago; some enchantment seems to have held her mind. She is a myth and an idea, a dream and a vision, and yet very real and present and pervasive. There are terrifying glimpses of dark corridors which seem to lead back to primeval night, but also there is the fullness and warmth of the day about her. Shameful and repellent she is occasionally, perverse and obstinate, sometimes even a little hysteric, this lady with a past, But she is very lovable, and none of her children can forget her wherever they go or whatever strange fate befalls them. For she is part of them in her greatness as well as her failings, and they are mirrored in those deep eyes of hers that have seen so much of life’s passion and joy and folly, and looked down into wisdom’s well. Each one of them is drawn to her, though perhaps each has a different reason for that attraction or can point to no reason at all, and each sees some different aspect of her many-sided personality. From age to age she has produced great men and women, carrying on the old tradition and yet ever adapting it to changing times. Rabindranath Tagore, in line with that great succession, was full of the temper and urges of the modem age and yet was rooted in India’s past, and in his own self built up a synthesis of the old and the new. ‘I love India,’ he said, ‘not because I cultivate the idolatry of geography, not because I have had the chance to be born in her soil but because she has saved through tumultuous ages the living words that have issued from the illuminated consciousness of her great ones.’ So many will say, while others will explain their love for her in some different way. The old enchantment seems to be breaking today and she is looking around and waking up to the present. But however she changes, as change she must, that old witchery will continue and hold the hearts of her people. Though her attire many change, she will continue as of old, and her store of wisdom will help her to hold on to what is true and beautiful and good in this harsh, vindictive, and grasping world.

# The Book of Women: Celebrating the Female Spirit (Foundations of a New Humanity) (Osho)

I am not talking here as a man; otherwise it is impossible to talk about the woman. I am talking as awareness. I.

I am not talking here as a man; otherwise it is impossible to talk about the woman. I am talking as awareness.

Have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.

Please comment. I have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.

I have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.

Understanding any expression of existence—men or women or trees or animals or birds—is the function of science, not of a mystic.

With Albert Einstein the whole history of science has taken a very different route because the more he went into the deepest core of matter, the more he became puzzled.

“You don’t understand. It is made in such a way that nobody can solve it—mathematician or no mathematician.”.

“It is made in this way so that the boy from the very beginning starts learning that life cannot be solved, cannot be understood.”.

Am a mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think my small boy will be able to?”.

“I am a mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think my small boy will be able to?”.

A psychiatrist is a fellow who asks you a lot of expensive questions that your wife asks you for nothing.

You may speak of love and tenderness and passion, but real ecstasy is discovering you haven’t lost your keys after.

You may speak of love and tenderness and passion, but real ecstasy is discovering you haven’t lost your keys after all.

Women begin by resisting a man’s advances and end by blocking his retreat.

You want to change a woman’s mind, agree with her.

If you want to change a woman’s mind, agree with her.

If you want to know what a woman really means, look at her—don’t listen to her.

The lady walked up to the policeman and said, “Officer, that man on the corner is annoying me.” “I have been watching the whole time,” said the cop, “and that man wasn’t even looking at you.” “Well,” said the woman, “isn’t that annoying?”.

The romantic young man turned to the beautiful young girl in his bed and asked, “Am I the first man you ever made love to?” She thought for a moment and then said, “You could be—I have a terrible memory for faces.”.

Ultimately the man who goes on trying to understand life proves to be a fool, and the man who enjoys life becomes wise and goes on enjoying life, because he becomes more and more aware of the mysterious that surrounds us.

One is that the woman is capable of producing life; man is not.

One is that the woman is capable of producing life; man is not. In that way he is inferior, and that inferiority has played a great role in the domination of women by men. The inferiority complex works in this way: It pretends to be superior—to deceive oneself and to deceive the whole world. So man down the ages has been trying to destroy the woman’s genius, talents, capacities, so that he can prove himself superior—to himself and to the world.

One difference I see is that a woman is more capable of love than a man is.

The woman can be satisfied with one love, utterly fulfilled, because she does not look at the body of the man, she looks at his innermost qualities.

Love never should be forced, love never should be an attempt. It should not be in the mind at all—you are playing, dancing, singing, enjoying … part of this long joy. If it happens, then it is beautiful. When love happens, it has beauty. When it is made to happen, it is ugly.

In Hinduism, the woman had to die when the husband died. What a great jealousy! You have possessed her your whole life, and even after death you want to possess her. You are afraid. She is beautiful, and when you are gone, who knows? She may find another partner, perhaps better than you. So the system of sati prevailed for thousands of years—the most ugly phenomenon you can imagine.

Man is very egoistic. That’s why I call him male chauvinistic. Man has created this society, and in this society there is no place for the woman. And she has tremendous qualities of her own! For example, if man has the possibility of intelligence, the woman has the possibility of love. It does not mean she cannot have intelligence; she can have intelligence, she just has to be given the chance to develop it. But love she is born with—she has more compassion, more kindness, more understanding. Man and woman are two strings of one harp, but both are in suffering separate from each other. And because they are suffering and do not know the reason, they start taking revenge on each other.

It is not enough to earn money, it is not enough to become a success in the world; more necessary is a beautiful home, and the woman has the capacity to change any house into a home. She can fill it with love; she has that sensitivity. She can rejuvenate man, help him relax.

“I hope you will become a mother of ten children, and finally, your husband will be your eleventh child. And unless you become a mother to your husband, you have not succeeded in being a true wife.”.

The woman who loves you can enhance your creativity, can inspire you to heights you have never dreamed of. And she asks nothing. She simply wants your love, which is her basic right.

Love never creates bondage, it gives freedom.

The woman should search into her own soul for her own potential and develop it, and she will have a beautiful future. Man and woman are neither equal nor unequal, they are unique. And the meeting of two unique beings brings something miraculous into existence.

Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.

But the truth is that the pain and suffering that women of the world have gone through is a thousandfold more than man has ever known.

All the knowledge, all your conditionings, the whole process of your upbringing, your education, your society and civilization—they constitute the shell which keeps you and your understanding imprisoned. But he is not mentioning a single word of what he means by “shell.”.

On one hand it protects, on another hand it destroys. It is true that if you keep the wonder in your eyes you will be surprised to know that even pain has its own sweetness, its own miracle, its own joy. It is not less wondrous than joy itself. But the strange fact is that the woman is always more like a child, more full of wonder than man. Man is always after knowledge—and what is knowledge? Knowledge is just a means to get rid of wonder. The whole of science is trying to demystify existence, and the word science means knowledge. And it is a very simple fact that the more you know, the less you wonder.

And what is man’s function? He does not participate in her pain. Nine months she suffers, the birth of the child she suffers—and what does the man do? As far as the man is concerned, he simply uses the woman as an object to fulfill his lust and sexuality. He is not concerned at all about what the consequence will be for the woman. And still he goes on saying, “I love you.” If he had really loved her, the world would not have been overpopulated. His word “love” is absolutely empty. He has treated her almost like cattle.

Unless you have a rebellious spirit you are not alive in the true sense of the word.

You can make anybody confess anything if you go on torturing him. A point comes when he feels it is better to confess rather than to unnecessarily suffer the same torture every day.

Real liberation will make the woman authentically a woman, not an imitation of man.

Real liberation will make the woman authentically a woman, not an imitation of man. Right now that’s what is happening: Women are trying to be just like men. If men smoke cigarettes then the woman has to smoke cigarettes. If they wear pants then the woman has to wear pants. If they do a certain thing then the woman has to do that. She is just becoming a second-rate man.

I would like the woman to become really a woman, because much depends on her. She is far more important than man because she carries in her womb both the woman and the man. She mothers both, the boy and the girl; she nourishes both. If she is poisoned, then her milk is poisoned, then her ways of bringing up children are poisoned.

The woman needs total freedom so that she can give freedom to man too. This is one of the fundamentals to be remembered: If you make somebody a slave you will be reduced to slavery ultimately, finally; you can’t remain free. If you want to remain free, give freedom to others; that’s the only way to be free.

The Liberation movement that is going on in the world is a man-created phenomenon, a male-created phenomenon. You will be surprised about it, that it is again a male conspiracy. Now man wants to get rid of women. He wants to have no responsibility. He wants to enjoy women, but only as fun. He does not want to take all the other responsibilities that come with it. Now, this is a subtle conspiracy: The man is trying to persuade women all over the world that the woman has to become independent. It is a subtle trick. And the male mind is cunning and the male mind is succeeding. And now many women have become poisoned by this idea.

In the past also it has been so. Man has persuaded women in the past that they are pure beings, angels. Man is dirty, boys are boys—but the woman? She is divine. Man has put woman on a high pedestal; that was his trick to control woman. Man has worshipped, and through worship he has controlled. And naturally, when the woman was on the pedestal she thought that she was something divine—she could not do those things that men are doing, she could not, because that was going against her ego. That high pedestal was very ego-satisfying. She was the mother, she was divine; she had more divine qualities than man. Man is ugly, immoral, and all that. Man has to be forgiven.

What is needed is that man should become more like woman, rather than woman becoming more like man.

The home is the visible womb outside the woman, it is a projection of the inner womb.

Want to say to the women of the whole world that your Liberation movement has not done anything, because it is in the hands of very stupid women. They are reactionaries, not revolutionaries. Otherwise, the simple and the most important thing, the first priority, is that the women should demand a separate vote, so that women can only vote for women, and men can only vote for men. Just a simple and single step, and all the parliaments of the world will be half-filled with women. And the women will be naturally in power because man by nature has a tendency to fight. He will create parties, political parties, religious ideologies—on small, minor, trivial things. So if the women in a parliament are one single whole, the other half, of men, will be divided into at least eight or ten parties. The whole world can move into the hands of women. And women are not interested in wars, women are not interested in nuclear weapons, women are not interested in communism or capitalism.

All these “isms” are from the head. Women are interested in being joyful, in small things of life: a beautiful house, a garden, a swimming pool. Life can be a paradise, but it is going to remain a hell unless man is removed from power altogether. And he can be remedied so easily.

Women are more irritable, nagging, bitchy, and the reason is that they have been deprived of something that is their birthright; and they don’t even know what it is.

Men and women should not be in a contract, like marriage. They should be in love—but they should retain their freedom. They don’t owe anything to each other.

The pill, in my opinion, is the greatest revolution that has happened in history. All its implications have not yet been made available to man. In the past it was difficult, because making love meant more and more children. That was destroying the woman, she was always pregnant. And to remain pregnant and give birth to twelve or twenty children is a torturous experience. Women were used like cattle.

And the greatest harm that has been done to her is marriage, because neither man nor woman is monogamous; psychologically they are polygamous. So their whole psychology has been forced against its own nature.

So their whole psychology has been forced against its own nature. And because woman was dependent on man she had to suffer all kinds of insults—because man was the master, he was the owner, he had all the money.

The strange fact is, all religions are against prostitution—and they are the cause of it!.

The strange fact is, all religions are against prostitution—and they are the cause of it! They are all for marriage, and they cannot see a simple fact that prostitution came into existence with marriage.

Make your love a really festive affair, don’t make it a hit-and-run affair. Dance, sing, play music—and don’t let sex be cerebral. Cerebral sex is not authentic; sex should be spontaneous. Create the situation. Your bedroom should be a place as holy as a temple. In your bedroom don’t do anything else; sing and dance and play, and if love happens on its own, as a spontaneous thing, you will be immensely surprised that biology has given you a glimpse of meditation.

Love. It is unfortunate that even animals know how to love, and man has to be taught.

Once you have a sexual relationship with a woman, she cannot have respect for you. That has been the cost—because she knows you have used her.

Of the causes that marked the change between the Western woman and the Eastern, the first is Karl Marx. He proposed, and convinced the intelligentsia of the whole world, that poverty has nothing to do with any past life, or with fate, or with destiny; that it is not decided by God who should be poor and who should be rich. It is the social structure, the economic structure which decides who is going to be poor. And this structure can be changed, because it is not God-made—there is no God, as such—it is man-made.

The second hammering came from Sigmund Freud. He declared that men and women are equal, belong to the same species, and any theories or philosophies which condemn women are simply inhuman and male chauvinistic. And then the third and the last hammering came from Masters and Johnson’s research, which brought to light that the woman has been deprived of orgasm for centuries. It proved that man has been really inhuman in his behavior. As far as his own sexual needs were concerned he used the woman, but he did not allow the woman to enjoy sex.

The Women’s Liberation movement declares that they don’t want to have any relationship with men—cut off all relationships with men. And as a reaction, women should do everything to man that he has done to her: misbehave, mistreat, use dirty words as man has always done, smoke cigarettes as man has always done. Naturally, they are losing their grace, their beauty … dress just as man has always dressed. But it is a strange phenomenon that the way you dress changes so much. The Eastern woman’s dress has a grace, and it gives a grace to her whole body. The Western woman is trying to compete with cowboys—blue jeans, stupid-looking clothes, ugly hairdos. They think perhaps they are taking revenge—they are destroying themselves. But revenge always destroys you, reaction always destroys you. I would love to see them as rebels.

You are attracted to something which is a challenge to get.

“Now things cannot be beautiful. The wind that has blown is no longer there. The season has changed, it is no longer spring between us; no flowers blossom, no fragrance arises. It is time to part.”.

You don’t just go and start painting just because the canvas is available and the brush is there and the color is there. You don’t start painting. You don’t say, “All requirements are here, so I can paint.” You can paint—but you will not be a painter that way.

You meet a woman, the canvas is there. You immediately become a lover—you start painting, and she starts painting on you. Of course you both prove to be foolish—painted fools—and sooner or later you understand what is happening. But you never thought that love is an art. You are not born with the art, it is nothing to do with your birth. You have to learn it. It is the most subtle art.

The requirement is that a great lover is always ready to give love and is not bothered whether it is returned or not.

Each heart is a valley. If you pour love into it, it will respond.

The first lesson of love is not to ask for love, but just to give.

The first lesson of love is not to ask for love, but just to give. Become a giver. And people are doing just the opposite. Even when they give, they give only with the idea that love should come back. It is a bargain. They don’t share, they don’t share freely. They share with a condition. They go on watching out of the corner of their eye whether it is coming back or not. Very poor people … they don’t know the natural functioning of love. You simply pour, it will come.

And if it is not coming, nothing to be worried about—because a lover knows that to love is to be happy.

As one learns swimming by swimming, by loving one loves.

They just wait. From somewhere some Cleopatra will come and then they will open their heart, but by that time they have completely forgotten how to open it.

“You don’t love me anymore?” asked Mulla Nasruddin’s wife. “You never say anything nice to me anymore like you used to when we were courting.” She wiped a tear from her eye with the corner of her apron. “I love you, I love you,” retorted Mulla Nasruddin. “Now will you please shut up and let me drink my beer in peace?”.

In fact, society should create all barriers possible for marriage and no barrier for divorce.

The court should create barriers—live with the woman for two years at least, then the court can allow you to get married.

Two persons should be allowed to live together long enough to become acquainted, familiar with each other. And even if they want to get married, they should not be allowed. Then divorces will disappear from the world. The divorces exist because marriages are wrong and forced.

A romantic mood is good if you are a poet—and poets are not known to be good husbands or good wives. In fact poets are almost always single. They fool around but they never get caught, and hence their romance remains.

One should not get married to a woman or to a man in a poetic mood. Let the prose mood come, then settle.

Love is not a passion, love is not an emotion. Love is a very deep understanding that somebody somehow completes you. Somebody makes you a full circle. The presence of the other enhances your presence. Love gives freedom to be yourself; it is not possessiveness.

Just meditate over a few of Murphy’s sutras. First: It is good to be married occasionally. Second: A clever man tells a woman he understands her, a stupid man tries to prove it. Third: Marriage is a three-ringed circus: engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffer-ring. Fourth: Marriage may make the world go round, but so does a punch in the nose. Fifth: Saving a marriage from divorce: The only way is not to show up for the wedding. Sixth: A woman is God’s second mistake—man is the first, obviously—and two wrongs together don’t make a right. And the last: A woman is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of man. So beware! If you want to get married, who am I to object? I can only make you a little more aware. Think before you jump!.

Millions of people have decided not to love human beings anymore. It is better to love a dog, a cat, a parrot; it is better to love a car—because you can dominate them well, and the other never tries to dominate you. It is simple; it is not as complex as it is going to be with human beings.

Love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the.

Love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the ego. And man is very afraid of dropping the ego. It seems almost like committing suicide. It only seems so because we don’t know anything other than the ego.

Them. You will give dignity to people by your love; you.

To relate is one of the greatest things of life: To relate means to love, to relate means to share. But before you can share, you must have. And before you can love you must be full of love, overflowing with love.

Two seeds cannot relate, they are closed. Two flowers can relate; they are open, they can send their fragrances to each other, they can dance in the same sun and in the same wind, they can have a dialogue, they can whisper.

Death is secure, life is insecurity.

One who wants to reach to the peaks has to take the risk of getting lost.

One who wants to climb the highest peaks has to take the risk of falling from somewhere, slipping down.

The flower is exposed—such a delicate thing, and exposed to so many hazards: A strong wind may come, it may rain cats and dogs, the sun may be too hot, some foolish man may pluck the flower. Anything can happen to the flower, everything can happen to the flower, the flower is constantly in danger.

Seed is safe; hence millions of people decide to remain seeds. But to remain a seed is to remain dead, to remain a seed is not to live at.

Seed is safe; hence millions of people decide to remain seeds. But to remain a seed is to remain dead, to remain a seed is not to live at all.

The seed cannot be destroyed so easily by the wind, the seed is very protected, secure.

First be, then all else shall be added unto you.

Relating is a process. Avoid relationships, and go deeper and deeper into relating.

My emphasis is on verbs, not on nouns; avoid nouns as much as possible. In language you cannot avoid, that I know; but in life, avoid—because life is a verb. Life is not a noun, it is really living, not life. It is not love, it is loving. It is not relationship, it is relating. It is not a song, it is singing. It is not a dance, it is dancing.

Meditate, find out your own center first. Before you can relate with somebody else, relate with yourself. That is the basic requirement to be fulfilled. Without it, nothing is possible. With it, nothing is impossible.

You can allow somebody to enter to your center only when you are not afraid, when you are not fearful.

Don’t be bothered about the result. That is the fear-oriented mind. Don’t think about what will happen out of it. Just be here, and act, totally. Don’t calculate. A fear-oriented man is always calculating, planning, arranging, safeguarding. His whole life is lost in this way.

“They are like a person who is naked, but never goes to take a bath in the river because he is afraid—where will he dry his clothes?”.

What have you got to lose? Nothing. This body will be taken by death. Before it is taken by death, give it to love. Whatsoever you have will be taken away. Before it is taken away, why not share it? That is the only way of possessing it. If you can share and give, you are the master. It is going to be taken away. There is nothing which you can retain forever. Death will destroy everything.

Nobody is against you! Even if you feel somebody is against you, he too is not against you—because everybody is concerned with himself, not with you.

When two centers meet, there is love. And love is an alchemical phenomenon—just like hydrogen and oxygen meet and a new thing, water, is created. You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want, as much.

You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want, as much hydrogen as you like, but the thirst will not go.

The basic requirement is that the other has to be given absolute freedom to be himself.

First, never treat the child as yours, never possess the child. It comes through you, but it is not yours.

Love, but never possess the child.

Never treat a child like a child. Treat the child with deep respect. God has chosen.

Never treat a child like a child. Treat the child with deep respect. God has chosen you to be a host.

It is very difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child.

It is very difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child. Humiliation comes very easy because the child is helpless and cannot do anything, cannot retaliate, cannot react.

Once you respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him. You don’t try to impose anything on the child. You.

Once you respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him.

You help him to become more and more powerful in exploring the world, but you never give him directions.

Never, never help him in any way, force him in any way, to become a hypocrite.

Don’t listen to morality, don’t listen to religion, don’t listen to culture—listen to nature.

Whatsoever is natural is good—even if sometimes it is very difficult for you, very uncomfortable for you.

Before the child is born you should go as deeply as possible in meditation.

“I am pregnant, and the child is more important than getting angry at you.

“I am pregnant, and the child is more important than getting angry at you. This episode will pass and after a few days I will not remember who has insulted me and what I have done. But the child is going to be there at least seventy, eighty years in the world. It is a big project.”.

When a child is there you are both secondary; the child has every preference.

Give love, but never give a structure. Give love, but never give a character.

In fact, the mother never thinks of her child as a grown-up person who is able to be free.

So from this very moment, from the very beginning, be respectful and give him freedom.

He is not here in this world to follow your opinion.

You are creating something immensely valuable—you are carving a life, you are protecting a life.

Don’t take it too seriously, otherwise you will destroy the child. Your seriousness will become destructive. Take it playfully. The responsibility is there! But it has to be taken very playfully.

There are people who are afraid of women, and if you are afraid of women you can’t love them. How can love arise out of fear? And why are you afraid of women?—because your childhood was lived in fear of your mother. She was constantly after you, she was constantly hammering you. She was constantly telling you to do this and not to do that—of course, for your own good. She has crippled you, she has destroyed many things in you. She has made you phony because she has told you what is right to do. Whether you like it or not, whether it is spontaneously arising in you or not, you have to follow the order.

A boy who has really been dominated by the mother, who has been reduced into absolute obedience, will not be able to make love to a woman, because as he will come close to the woman psychologically he will go impotent. How can you make love to your mother? It is impossible.

It conditions the child to a certain religious ideology, political dogma, some philosophy, some theology.

Each child is angry with his mother. The mother has to prohibit many things, the mother has to say no—it cannot be avoided. Even a good mother sometimes has to say no, and restrict and deny. The child feels rage, anger. He hates the mother and loves the mother also because she is his survival, his source of life and energy. So he hates the mother and loves the mother together.

Love is like a breeze. You see … it just comes. If it is there it is there. Then it is gone. And when it is gone it is gone.

The religious priests, the popes and others, would not like man to live joyously for the simple reason that if people started living joyfully, cheerfully, blissfully, who will bother about their paradise.

The religious priests, the popes and others, would not like man to live joyously for the simple reason that if people started living joyfully, cheerfully, blissfully, who will bother about their paradise and their heaven?.

Everything new looks inhuman in the beginning.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her. And it is bound to be so, because whether you are man or woman, you are created by one man, one woman. They have contributed to you half and half. Your.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her. And it is bound to be so, because whether you are man or woman, you are created by one man, one woman. They have contributed to you half and half. Your father and your mother both are alive in you.

Love is so fulfilling that who cares about writing poetry? Poetry is written by people who have missed the train.

Love is so fulfilling that who cares about writing poetry? Poetry is written by people who have missed the train. Now they are somehow consoling themselves by writing poetry about love—love they do not know.

But I would like you to know that you will be a loser. You are competing with man, and you need not compete; you are already superior. You need not write poetry, you are poetry. Your love is your music. Your heart throbbing with your lover is your dance!.

The woman is the superior sex; she need not prove it.

But drop the idea that you will be creating something superior out of love. If you really want to create something, don’t think of love either, because love is so satisfying, so fulfilling. It is such a miracle, who wants to write poetry?.

I have never come across a single lover, man or woman, who has created poetry, who has created paintings, who has created sculptures, for the simple reason that they are so contented. All these creative things need a discontent, a wound which you have to cover up.

I am perfectly happy with your idea. Just do whatever creative endeavor you want to; but remember, you don’t have the inferiority complex of man, so you cannot compete with man in any way. You are already in a better position. Man is poor; just have compassion for the poor guy.

The other day you said that women create children, and men create arts and other material things.

In poor countries still the old idea continues that the more children you have the better off you will be economically. In the past it was true—it is absolutely false today. Mohammed married nine women and he allowed Mohammedans to marry four women, simply to create more Mohammedans, because there was constant war between the Mohammedans and the non-Mohammedans and it was a question of power—the politics of numbers.

Giving birth to a child is not anything conscious, deliberate, meditative. You are just being used by nature, by biology as a means to propagate the race, the species.

If a purpose is there—that you want to create a child—then it is business. If there is no purpose, if it is purposeless fun, then only does it have beauty, and then it does not create any bondage.

And man has been telling her, “You are great because you give birth to children!” This is a rationalization, this is a consolation. Beware of such tricks. Man has exploited woman in every possible way and it is time to finish this exploitation.

This has been one of the greatest calamities in human history: Because women have never been appreciated for their talents, they have by and by retarded their talents. Because a retarded woman was appreciated more, a foolish woman was appreciated more. She just had to have a beautiful, proportionate body and no mind, nothing more. She should be a cow—with no intelligence, with no penetrating awareness. That was expected, otherwise the man would feel embarrassed, hurt. So women have learned a trick down the ages—that the rule of the game is that the woman should not show her talents. If she is intelligent she should pretend she is stupid. If she is creative s <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>.

# Reservoir Modelling (Steve Cannon)

This book is focused on the development of structurally complex, clastic, offshore fields rather than large onshore producing fields.


# Advanced Petroleum Reservoir Simulation (M. R. Islam;M. E. Hossain;S. H. Moussavizadegan;S. Mustafiz;J. H. Abou-Kassem)

The petroleum industry is known as the biggest user of computer models.

The petroleum industry is known as the biggest user of computer models. Even though space research and weather prediction models are robust and often tagged as the “mother of all simulation”, the fact that a space probe device or a weather balloon can be launched – while a vehicle capable of moving around in a petroleum reservoir cannot – makes reservoir modeling more challenging than in any other discipline.

First, there is a lack of data and their proper scaling up.

Second is the problem of assuring correct solutions to the mathematical models that represent the reservoir data.

Data acquisition and remote-sensing ability. However, in the absence of proper science, it is anecdotally said that a weather model of Alaska can be used to simulate a petroleum reservoir in Texas. Of course, pragmatism.

However, in the absence of proper science, it is anecdotally said that a weather model of Alaska can be used to simulate a petroleum reservoir in Texas.

This has the embedded assumption that ‘outcome justifies the process’ – the ultimate of the obsession with externals.

That proper reservoir simulation should be transparent and empower decision makers rather than creating a black box.

This principle implies that the input data have to be accurate for the simulation results to be acceptable.

Petroleum industry has established itself as the pioneer of subsurface data collection.

For a modeling process to be knowledge-based, it must fulfill two criteria, namely, the source has to be true (or real) and the subsequent processing has to be true.


# Book of Man (Osho)

Priests and politicians have caused a tremendous split in man. They have created a guilt-ridden man who is alienated from himself, fighting a permanent inner conflict which pervades all areas of his life—a conflict between body and soul, matter and mind, materialism and spiritualism, science and religion, man and woman, West and East . ..

Life can be lived in two ways: either as calculation—in science, technology, mathematics, economics—or as poetry—in art, music, beauty, love.

He loses access to his innate feminine qualities of feeling, gentleness, love and intuition and becomes a head-oriented, efficient, unfeeling robot.

Society teaches man to become a ‘strong man’ which is synonymous with suppressing his feminine qualities of softness and receptivity, love and compassion. But every man has an ‘inner woman’ inside—his own unconscious or semi-conscious female part, which has been denied and suppressed for thousands of years.

‘No man is just man and no woman is just woman; each man is both man and woman, and so is each woman—woman and man.

‘My vision of the new man is of a rebel, of a man who is in search of his original self, of his original face. A man who is ready to drop all masks, all pretensions, all hypocrisies, and show to the world what he, in reality, is. Whether he is loved or condemned, respected, honoured or dishonoured, crowned or crucified, does not matter; because to be yourself is the greatest blessing in existence. Even if you are crucified, you will be crucified fulfilled and immensely contented. A man of truth, a man of sincerity, a man who knows love and who knows compassion, and who understands that people are blind, unconscious, asleep, spiritually asleep.’.

Everybody is coming out with a mask which is smiling, happy looking, so everybody is deceiving everybody else.

Even friends, even lovers keep one another at a distance: too much closeness will be dangerous, they may see your reality.

Nature has no idea of money, otherwise dollars would have been growing on trees.

Just be yourself, then there is no misery, no competition and no botheration that others have more, that you don’t have more.

The world is against individuality. It is against your being just your natural self.

You were born an emperor, utterly contented within yourself. But your father wants you to love him, your mother wants you to love her. Everybody around you wants to become an object of your love. Nobody bothers that a man who cannot love himself cannot love anybody else either. So a very mad society is created where everybody is trying to love somebody.

A rightly brought up child will be allowed to grow in love towards himself so that he becomes so full of love that sharing becomes a necessity.

You are the giver; the giver is never a beggar.

‘I am to love myself; otherwise, I will miss the meaning of life. I will never grow up, I will simply grow old. I will not have any individuality. I will not be truly human, dignified, integrated.’.

In Japan, they have 400-year-old trees, but their height is only 6 inches. They think that it is a form of art. It is murder, sheer murder! The tree looks ancient, but is only 6 inches high. It would have been 100 feet high, reaching towards the stars. What have they done? What strategy have they used? The same strategy has been used against humanity, human beings. They put the tree in a pot which has no bottom. So whenever the tree grows its roots, they go on cutting them, because there is no bottom to the pot. The roots they go on cutting, and unless roots grow deeper, the tree cannot rise higher. It grows old, but it never grows up. Exactly the same has been done with human beings.

The people of the United States were killing innocent, poor people in Vietnam. What business was it of theirs? And it was not one-sided. They were sending their own, who have not tasted anything of life, to kill and to be killed in the name of democracy, in the name of America. But why should one sacrifice oneself in any name? Mohammedans and Christians have been fighting, killing each other, in the name of God. Both are struggling with one another in the same name—God. A strange world we have created! But the strategy is very simple: destroy the person’s natural love for himself. Then he is so unworthy in his own eyes, he is ready to do anything for a gold medal, just to feel a little worth—that he is also somebody. Do you see on your generals many coloured stripes? What kind of stupidity is this? Those stripes go on growing as the general goes on killing himself, destroying himself.

But you can accept responsibility only when you have tremendous love for yourself.

‘One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I would rather suffer for the entire eternity in hellfire, but I will remain myself. At least that much joy I will have—that this is my choice, nobody has forced me.’.

‘One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I would rather suffer for the entire eternity in hellfire, but I will remain myself. At least that much joy I will have—.

You just need to trust yourself; that is another name for loving yourself. And when you trust and love yourself, obviously, you have taken all the responsibility of whatever you are, whoever you are, upon your shoulders. That gives such a tremendous experience of being that nobody can enslave you again.

‘That’s what I want to know. Life, I have known. It was beautiful; with all its anxieties, anguishes, still it was a joy. Just to breathe is joy enough. I have lived, I have loved; I have done whatever I wanted to do, I have said whatever I wanted to say. Now I want to taste death—and the sooner the better.

‘There are only two possibilities: either my soul will go on living in other forms as the Eastern mystics say—that is a great excitement, to go on that journey of the soul free from the burden of the body. The body is a cage, it has limitations. Or perhaps the materialists are right, that when your body dies, everything dies. Nobody remains afterwards. That too, is a great excitement—not to be! I know what it means to be, and the moment has come to find out what it means not to be. And when I am no more, what is the problem? Why should I be worried about it? I will not be there to worry, so why waste time now?’.

‘And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am responsible. I knew that it was going to happen because to talk about truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask for death.

‘And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am responsible. I knew that it was going to happen because to talk about truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask for death. Don’t blame these poor people who have decided my death. If anybody is responsible, I am. And I want you all to know that I lived taking responsibility for myself and I am dying taking responsibility for myself. Living, I was an individual. Dying, I am an individual. Nobody decides for me; I am decisive about myself.’.

Be yourself, just yourself, simply yourself. And, remember, you are taking a great risk when you declare that you are simply yourself. You don’t belong to any crowd, any herd. These are all herds: Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, Communists. You are declaring yourself an individual, knowing perfectly well that it is risky. The crowd may not forgive you at all. But it is so beautiful to take the risk, to move on the razor’s edge where every step is dangerous.

Don’t want you to be a businessman, I want you to be a gambler. And when you are gambling, put everything at stake. Don’t save anything for the next moment. Then whatever happens will bring great blessing to you. Even if you become a beggar, your being will be far more dignified than that of an emperor.

I don’t want you to be a businessman, I want you to be a gambler. And when you are gambling, put everything at stake. Don’t save anything for the next moment. Then whatever happens will bring great blessing to you. Even if you become a beggar, your being will be far more dignified than that of an emperor.

Once a man falls in love with rebellion, he is on the right path.

And it has enforced those ideals so deeply in you that you are always interested in the ideal, ‘how I should be’ and you have forgotten who you are.

Neither does the rose ever try to become a lotus, nor does the lotus ever try to become a rose.

Live moment to moment, with tremendous acceptance, without creating any division, and you are on the way towards self-knowledge.

It is not really sadness that gives you pain. It is the interpretation that sadness is wrong that gives you pain, and that becomes a psychological problem. It is not anger that is painful; it is the idea that anger is wrong that creates psychological anxiety. It is the interpretation, not the fact. The fact is always liberating.

Repression is to live a life that you were not meant to live. Repression is to do things which you never wanted to do. Repression is to be the fellow that you are not. Repression is a way to destroy yourself. Repression is suicide—very slow, of course, but a very certain, slow poisoning. Expression is life; repression is suicide.

Society has played a great game—it has put everybody against himself. So you are continuously fighting within yourself.

Continuously fighting. Society has divided you into a split person: it has made you schizophrenic and it has confused you.

Cannot give you God, I cannot give you truth, I cannot give you your inner core, but I can take all the rubbish that has been heaped upon.

I cannot give you God, I cannot give you truth, I cannot give you your inner core, but I can take all the rubbish that has been heaped upon you.

The problem becomes more complicated because the people he has to protect himself against are the people who think that they love him.

He has to fight against those whom he loves, and he thinks they love him too.

‘We will love you, we do love you, but only if you follow the way we are following, if you follow the religion we are following, if you become obedient the way we are obedient.’.

Disobedience is the foundation of a real religious man—disobedience to all priests, to all politicians, to all vested interests.

Love your children, but never hope through them.

Love your children as much as you can and give them a feeling that they are loved for themselves and not for any other use that they can be of.

Love your children tremendously and give them a feeling that they are accepted as they are.

He needs the mother, that’s one thing, he uses the mother, that’s one thing, but there is no law of nature that he should love the mother. He likes her because she is so helpful, so useful; without her, he cannot exist. So he is grateful, respectful—all these things are okay—but love is a totally different phenomenon.

And it is very simple because the child’s love will flow towards his own child, it cannot go backwards—just as the Ganges goes on flowing towards the ocean, not towards the source.

You fall in love with the colour of the hair—now, what has that to do with love? After two days, you will not look at the colour of the hair at all.

So, remember, that love for the mother has to be more like respect, less like love. Love towards your mother has to be more of the quality of gratefulness, respect, deep respect.

Man is a machine, that’s why. Man, as he is, is utterly unconscious. He is nothing but his habits, the sum total of his habits.

Reaction comes out of the past, responses come out of the present moment. Response is spontaneous, reaction is just old habit.

You are feeling nervous and you take out your cigarette and you start smoking. It is a reaction; whenever you have felt nervous, you have done it.

Somebody would come who had always been a vegetarian, and he would say, ‘Eat meat.’ Now, it is the same fundamental—this man is just a little too much of himself, a little eccentric. He would say, ‘Eat meat.’ Now, watch a vegetarian eating meat. The whole body wants to throw it out and he wants to vomit, and the whole mind is puzzled and disturbed and he starts perspiring, because the mind has no way to cope with it.

The politician means the desire to dominate, the desire to be number one. The politician means ambition, the ambitious mind.

Watch, become alert, observe, and go on dropping all the reactive patterns in you. Each moment try to respond to the reality—not according to the ready-made idea in you but according to the reality as it is there outside. Respond to the reality! Respond with your total consciousness but not with your mind.

A dog is a dog: he remains a dog. He is born a dog and will die a dog. A man can become a Buddha, and can become an Adolf Hitler too. So man is very open-ended on both sides—he can fall back.

All over nature, it is the male who attracts the female. And for that reason, all over nature, the male is more beautiful—because the female need not have any beauty; just being female is enough. But strange—man has been standing on his head continuously. It is the male who should be more beautiful so that a female is attracted towards him.

Celebration is the highest growth of consciousness. I teach you celebration. Celebration is my key.

The man continuously fights in the world so his male energy is exhausted. By the time he comes home, he wants to become feminine. He wants to rest from his male aggression. In the office, in the factory, in the marketplace, in politics—everywhere he has been fighting and fighting. At home, he does not want to fight, he wants to rest, because tomorrow again the world will start.

The whole day the woman has been feminine, not fighting at all; there was nobody to fight with. She is tired of being a woman . . . and the kitchen and everything and the children. She wants to enjoy a little bit of aggression and fight and nagging, and the poor husband is available. So she becomes male and the husband becomes female; that is the whole foundation of henpeckedness.

Men are better friends, remember; man and woman are never friends. Lovers are enemies but never friends; in fact, lovers and enemies, never friends. Men are very good friends; women don’t know how to be friendly. It is very difficult for women to love other women; they know each other too well—in fact they know too much about each other. But men are very friendly and homosexuals are really gay people, because there is no agony . . . but there is no ecstasy either. One has to risk and pay.

Man is aware deep down that woman has something which he does not have. In the first place, the woman is attractive to him, she looks beautiful. He falls in love with the woman, the woman becomes almost an addiction to him—and that’s where the trouble arises. The feeling of dependence on woman, which every man feels, makes him react in such a way that he tries to manage the woman as a slave—spiritually a slave. He is also afraid because she is beautiful. She is beautiful not only to him: she is beautiful to whomever looks at her, to whomever comes in contact with her. Great jealousy arises in the egoist, male chauvinist mind. He has done with women what Machiavelli suggests to politicians—marriage is politics too. Machiavelli suggests that the best way of defence is offense, and man has used the idea for centuries—centuries before Machiavelli recognized it as a basic fact in all political spheres. Wherever there is some kind of domination, offense is certainly the best way of defence. In defence, you are already losing ground; you have already accepted yourself as the defeated side. You are just protecting yourself.

In India, there are religious scriptures like Manu Smriti, 5,000 years old, and they suggest that if you want to have peace in your house, giving a good beating to the woman once in a while is absolutely necessary.

In India, there are religious scriptures like Manu Smriti, 5,000 years old, and they suggest that if you want to have peace in your house, giving a good beating to the woman once in a while is absolutely necessary. She should be kept almost imprisoned. And that’s how she has lived—in different cultures, different countries, but her imprisonment has been almost the same.

A real superiority needs no proof, no evidence, no witness, no argument. A real superiority is immediately recognized by anybody who has even a small amount of intelligence. The real superiority has its own magnetic force.

Only in one thing is he stronger and that is he has a muscular body. He is a good manual worker. Otherwise, on every point he feels—and he has felt for centuries—a deep inferiority complex. To avoid that complex, the only way is to force woman into an inferior position. And that is the only thing that is more powerful in man: he can force woman. He is more cruel, he is more violent, and he has forced woman to accept an idea which is absolutely false: that she is weak. And to prove that woman is weak, he has to condemn all the feminine qualities. He has to say that they are all weak, and all those qualities together make woman weak.

The traits that are thought to be weak are all the feminine ones.

The delicate woman, the fragile woman, jumps into the funeral pyre and the stronger Mohammed Ali goes on doing his push-ups. And he is still stronger!.

The greatest problem has been that woman is capable of becoming a mother; she is capable of giving birth to life, and man is not. That was the beginning of the feeling of inferiority—that nature depends on woman, not on man.

Women are women, men are men; they have differences, but differences don’t make anybody higher or lower. Their differences create their attraction. Just think of a world where there are only men. It will be so ugly. Life is rich because there are differences, different attitudes, different opinions. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior. People are simply different.

Why do men have hair on their chests? Well, they can’t have everything!.

IT IS ONE of the human weaknesses, one of the deep-rooted frailties, to seek attention. The reason one seeks attention is because one does not know oneself. It is only in other people’s eyes can one see his face, in their opinions, he can find his personality. What they say matters immensely. If they neglect him, ignore him, he feels lost.

And the situation cannot change until you discover your authentic self—which does not depend on anybody’s opinion, attention, criticism, indifference, which does not have anything to do with anybody else.

Even if people condemn you, criticize you, are against you, that is acceptable; at least they are paying attention to you.

Once you know yourself, you don’t care about others. Even if the whole world forgets you, it does not matter, it does not even make the slightest difference to you; or the whole world can know—that too does not give you any ego.

You are emperors, but you have to discover yourself. And this discovery is not difficult: your kingdom is within you. You just have to learn to close your eyes and look inwards. A little discipline, a little learning not to remain focused on the outside continuously, but to turn inwards at least once or twice a day, whenever you can find time . . . Slowly, slowly you start becoming aware of your eternal being. Then the idea of attention simply disappears. And the miracle is: the day you don’t need anybody’s attention, people start feeling your charisma, because charisma is the radiation of your individuality. They start feeling that you are somebody special, unique—although they cannot pinpoint where your uniqueness is, what it is that attracts like a magnet.

And do you think, if you are divorced, you will not again choose another woman of the same type? If you ask psychologists, they will say you will again choose the same type of woman. You needed it; it is your own choice. You cannot live without misery. You think your wife is creating misery? It is because you wanted to live in misery—that’s why you have chosen this woman. You will again choose the same type of woman. You will only become attracted to the same type of woman unless you drop your old mind completely.

There are two things necessary to keep one’s wife happy. First: let her think she is having her own way. And second: let her have it.

Would love a world where the family is replaced by the commune. Psychologically, it is more healthy to have a commune, where children are not possessed by the parents, they belong to the commune; where children are not given the imprint of the mother and father only, they have many uncles in the commune, many aunts in the commune. Sometimes they sleep with this family, sometimes with that family. I want the family to be replaced by the commune, and in a commune, there is no need for marriage.

For the man who cannot live with himself, the other is a need, an absolute need, because whenever he is alone, he is bored with himself—so bored that he wants some occupation with somebody else. Because it is a need, it becomes a dependence, you have to depend on the other. And because it becomes a dependence, you hate, you rebel, you resist, because it is a slavery. Dependence is a kind of slavery, and nobody wants to be a slave.

You meet a woman—you are not able to live alone. The woman is also not able to live alone, that’s why she is meeting you; otherwise there is no need. Both are bored with themselves and both are thinking that the other will help to get rid of the boredom. Yes, in the beginning, it looks like that, but only in the beginning.

That’s why if you see a bored couple walking by, you can be certain they are married. If they are not bored, you can be certain they are not married. The man must be walking with somebody else’s wife, that’s why there is so much joy.

‘Who knows, I may come out of my boredom, my anguish, my anxiety, my aloneness. This woman may help me.’.

Because you are not meditative, you need others to keep you occupied. And because you are not meditative, you are not able to love either, because love is an overflowing joy. You are bored with yourself; what have you got to share with the other? Hence, being with the other also becomes hell.

One psychoanalyst met another psychoanalyst on the street. The first one said to the other, ‘You look fine. How am I?’.

Nobody knows about himself, nobody is acquainted with himself. We only see the faces of others. A woman looks beautiful, a man looks beautiful, smiling, all smiles. We don’t know his anguish. Maybe all those smiles are just a facade to deceive others and to deceive himself. Maybe behind those smiles there are great tears. Maybe he is afraid if he does not smile, he may start weeping and crying. When you see the other, you simply see the surface, you fall in love with the surface. But when you come closer, you soon know that the inner depths of the other person are as dark as your own. He is a beggar just as you are. Now . . . two beggars begging from each other.

Nobody can guarantee that two persons will always be happy together, because people change. When you meet a woman, she is one person, you are one person. After ten years, you will be another person, she will be another person. It is like a river: the water is continuously flowing. The people who had fallen in love are no longer there, both are no longer there. Now you can go on clinging to a certain promise given by somebody else—but you had not given it.

A real man of understanding never promises for tomorrow, he can only say, ‘For the moment.’ A really sincere man cannot promise at all. How can he promise? Who knows about tomorrow? Tomorrow may come, may not come. Tomorrow may come, ‘I will not be the same, you will not be the same.’ Tomorrow may come, ‘You may find somebody with whom you fit more deeply, I may find somebody whom I go with more harmoniously.’ The world is vast. Why exhaust it today? Keep doors open, keep alternatives open.

‘What has happened to Jack? I have not seen him for ages.’ ‘Oh, he married the girl he rescued from drowning.’ ‘And is he happy?’ ‘You bet! But he hates water now.’.

The need is because every man has a feminine part in his being, and every woman has a masculine part in her being. The only way to understand it, the easiest way to understand it, the most natural way to understand it is to be in deep, intimate relationship with someone. If you are a man, be in a deep, intimate relationship with a woman. Let trust grow so all barriers dissolve. Come so close to each other that you can look deep into the woman and the woman can look deep into you. Don’t be dishonest with each other.

You fall in love with a woman because she is so new: the physiology, the proportions of her body, the face, the eyes, the eyebrows, the colour of her hair, the way she walks, the way she turns, the way she says hello, the way she looks. Everything is new, the whole territory unknown: you would like to investigate this territory. It is inviting, it is very inviting; you are caught, hypnotized. And when you start approaching, she starts to run away; that is part of the game. The more she runs, the more enchanting she becomes. If she simply says, ‘Yes, I am ready,’ half of the enthusiasm will be dead that very moment. In fact, you will start thinking how to run away. So, she gives you a chance to chase her. People are never as happy as while the courting continues—very happy—because it is a chase. Man is basically a hunter, so when the woman is chased, running away, trying to hide here and there, avoiding, saying no, the man gets more and more hot. The challenge becomes intense; the woman has to be conquered. Now he is ready to die for her, or do whatsoever is needed, but the woman has to be conquered. He has to prove that he is no ordinary man.

The world remains the same sorry-go-round!.

The politician has no consciousness; in fact, he is trying to avoid his inner problems, he is trying to escape from his own problems. And the easiest way to do so is to become concerned about world problems, economics, politics, history, service to the poor, transformation of the conditions of society, reformation.

And the easiest way to do so is to become concerned about world problems, economics, politics, history, service to the poor, transformation of the conditions of society, reformation. All these are strategies for escaping from one’s own problems—subtle strategies, dangerous, because one feels that one is doing something great, while one is simply being a coward.

There are three ways to be ruined in this world: first is by sex, second is by gambling, and the third is by politics. Sex.

There are three ways to be ruined in this world: first is by sex, second is by gambling, and the third is by politics.

Second, remember the fundamental law of all revolutions: when the revolution comes, things will be different—not better, just different.

That religion has proved to be the opium of the people.

Hindus believe in the Vedas and believe that they are written by God himself—they are the most ancient books in existence but no Hindu bothers to look into them. If God wrote them, there is going to be something immensely valuable, but 98 per cent of the Vedas are just rubbish—such rubbish that it proves that they are not written by God.

These are ways of livelihood, these are ways of getting bread and butter, a shelter.

Carpenter’s son can become a buddha, why not you? Kabir was a weaver. He continued his work for his whole life; even.

When you close your shop, forget all about your business. When you come home, don’t carry the shop in your head. When you are home with your wife, with your children, don’t be a businessman. That is ugly: that means your being is becoming.

When you close your shop, forget all about your business. When you come home, don’t carry the shop in your head. When you are home with your wife, with your children, don’t be a businessman. That is ugly: that means your being is becoming coloured by your doing.

The being should remain transcendental to your doing and you should always be capable of putting your doing aside and entering into the world of your being.

Rosenfeld walked into the house with a grin on his face. ‘You will never guess what a bargain I just got,’ he told his wife. ‘I bought four polyester, steel-belted, radial wide-tread, white-walled, heavy-duty tyres, on sale!’ ‘Are you nuts?’ said Mistress Rosenfeld. ‘What did you buy tyres for? You don’t even have a car.’ ‘So,’ said Rosenfeld, ‘you buy brassieres, don’t you?’.

You simply show your money. So whatsoever is costly becomes significant, whatsoever is costly is thought to be significant.

Have you watched a child just running, shouting, dancing for nothing at all?—because he has nothing. If you ask him, ‘Why are you so happy?’ he will not be able to answer you. He will really think that you are mad. Is there any need for any cause to be happy? He will simply be shocked that the ‘why’ can be raised. He will shrug his shoulders and will go on his way and start singing and dancing again. The child has nothing. He is not a prime minister yet, he is not a president of the United States, he is not a Rockefeller. He owns nothing—maybe a few shells or a few stones that he has collected on the seashore, that’s all.

On the one hand, there is fear that you may miss and others may attain, and, on the other, a deep apprehension that even if you get what you are after, nothing is got. Even if you arrive, you arrive nowhere because death comes and destroys everything.

The most important thing that happened to the first man who walked on the moon was that he suddenly forgot that he was an American. Suddenly, the whole earth was one, there were no boundaries, because there is no map on earth. The American continent, the African continent, the Asian continent, this country and that country all disappeared.

A free man belongs to himself and nobody else. A free man is simply an energy with no name, no form, no race, no nation. The days of nations and races are past, the days of the individual are coming. In a better world, there will be no Germans, no Indians, no Hindus, no Christians—there will be pure individuals, perfectly free, living their life in their own way, not disturbing anybody’s life and not allowing anybody to disturb their lives.

Pornography exists because of the priests, not because of the ‘Playboys.’ In fact, the Playboys are only by-products of the priests. So much pornography exists simply because so much sex has been repressed; it wants to find some way, some outlet.

Killing arises only if sex is very repressed. It is a strange fact that whenever a society has been affluent, rich, sexually free, it was destroyed by poor, backward, repressive societies. That was the fate of Greek civilization, that was the fate of Roman civilization, that was the fate of Hindu civilization, and that is going to be the fate of American culture. It is very strange that the further evolved a society is, the more it is vulnerable to being destroyed easily by the less evolved, because the less evolved are more repressive. They are more foolish, they are more stupid; they still go on listening to the priests.

Have you observed that you get angry only with those people who are very intimate with you? The more the intimacy, the more the anger. Why? The greater the gap between you and the person, the less the anger that will be there. You do not get angry with a stranger. You get angry with your wife, with your husband, with your son, with your daughter, with your mother. Why? Why do you get more angry with persons who are more intimate with you? The reason is this: you are angry with yourself. The more intimate a person is with you, the more he has become identified with you.

The greatest warrior has nothing to do with war. He has nothing to do with fighting others. He has something to do inside himself. And it is not a fight, although it brings victory; it is not a war, not a conflict. But one has to be a warrior because one has to be very alert just like a warrior.

There are only two types of people in the world. People who want to live comfortably . . . . They are seeking death; they want a comfortable grave. And people who want to live. They choose to live dangerously, because life thrives only when there is risk. Have you ever gone climbing the mountains? The higher the climb, the fresher you feel, the younger you feel. The greater the danger of falling, the bigger the abyss by the side, the more alive you are . . . between life and death, when you are just hanging between life and death. Then there is no boredom, then there is no dust of the past, no desire for the future.

Or surfing or skiing or gliding: wherever there is a risk of losing life, there is tremendous joy because the risk of losing life makes you tremendously alive. Hence, people are attracted to dangerous sports.

People go climbing mountains. Somebody asked Hillary, ‘Why did you try to climb Everest? Why?’ And he said, ‘Because it is there—a constant challenge.’ It was risky, many people had died before. For almost sixty, seventy years, groups had been going, and it was almost a certain death. But still people were going. What was the attraction?.

And don’t make your tomorrow predictable. Expect nothing and be ready for everything. That’s what I mean when I say live dangerously.

I’m not saying don’t get married. It is a formality. Good, satisfy the society. But deep in your mind never possess the woman. Never for a single moment say, ‘You belong to me’—because how can a person belong to you? And when you start possessing the woman, she will start possessing you. Then you both are no longer in love. You are just crushing and killing each other, paralysing each other.

Love—but don’t degrade your love through marriage. Work—work is needed—but don’t let work become your only life.

Risk is the only guarantee for being truly alive.

THE BOHEMIAN LIFE is the only life worth living! All other kinds of lives are only lukewarm; they are more ways of committing slow suicide than ways of living life passionately and intensely.

You can be creative only if you are an individual, you cannot create as a part of the mob psychology. The mob psychology is uncreative; it lives a life that is more a drag. It knows no dance, no song, no joy; it is mechanical.

The creator cannot follow the well-trodden path. He has to search and find out his own way.

He has to inquire in the jungles of life, he has to go alone, he has to be a dropout from the mob mind, from the collective psychology.

The collective mind is the lowest mind in the world; even the so-called idiots are a little more superior than the collective idiocy.

But collectivity has its own bribes: it respects people, honours people, if they go on insisting that the way of the collective mind is the only right way.

Discipline is a beautiful word, but it has been misused as all other beautiful words have been misused in the past. The word discipline comes from the same root as the word disciple; the root meaning of the word is a process of learning. One who is ready to learn is a disciple, and the process of being ready to learn is discipline.

‘I know only one thing, that I know nothing.’.

One thing may be right this moment and may become wrong the next moment. Don’t try to be consistent, otherwise you will be dead. Only dead people are consistent.

Try to be alive, with all its inconsistencies, and live each moment without any reference to the past, without any reference to the future either. Live the moment in the context of the moment, and your response will be total. And that totality has beauty and that totality is creativity. Then whatsoever you do will have a beauty of its own.

A PERSON CAN either grow old or grow up. The person who only grows old has not lived at all. He has passed time, but he has not lived. All his life is nothing but repression. I teach you not to grow old. That does not mean you will not become old, it means I give you another dimension: growing.

There is no lust in his love, no desire, he wants to get nothing out of it. His love has a purity, an innocence; his love is a joy.

The old man knows that those childish desires were really childish. He knows that all those days of youth and turmoil are gone. He is in the same state as when the storm has gone and silence prevails. That silence can be of tremendous beauty, depth, richness. If the old man is really mature, which is very rarely the case, he will be beautiful. But people only grow in age, they don’t grow up. Hence the problem.

The eastern word for master is acharya. The word acharya means one who lives his life authentically, according to his own consciousness and awareness.

Being with him, you will learn only one thing: how to live in freedom, awareness, in deep integrity and dignity.

Think of two candles, one lit and one unlit, coming closer and closer. A moment comes when you will be suddenly amazed—both candles are lit. The flame has jumped to the other candle. Just a certain proximity . . . . Love creates that proximity, and the flame jumps from one heart to another heart. There is no question of anybody surrendering, there is no question of anybody believing.

Although he goes against society, just to be against society is not necessarily to be right. In fact, most of the time to move from one extreme to another is always to move from one wrong to another wrong.

‘Now I will decide each time whether to be obedient or not. I will not have a fixed philosophy but I will move according to the situation—because you have been cunning with me, you have been cheating me. I’m your son and still you have been cheating me!

Die Mannschaft — as the national squad is called — for almost a decade, as his 23 goals and 40 assists from 92 appearances attest. But when he released an explosive statement, with a declaration that he could no longer wear the German shirt with “pride and excitement”.

Özil’s burden July 25, 2018 00:00 IST Updated: July 25, 2018 03:36 IST The German footballer has been tragically bruised by the politics-sport interface Mesut Özil’s withdrawal from the German football team on Sunday came as a shock to many. One of the most gifted midfielders of his generation, Özil has been a mainstay of the Die Mannschaft — as the national squad is called — for almost a decade, as his 23 goals and 40 assists from 92 appearances attest. But when he released an explosive statement, with a declaration that he could no longer wear the German shirt with “pride and excitement” because of “racism and disrespect”, it caused many a football fan to shudder. The turn of events has its roots in Özil and fellow footballer İlkay Gündoğan meeting Turkish President Recep Erdoğan in London and presenting him with shirts just before the World Cup. Both Özil and Gündoğan are Germany-born players of Turkish origin and their act was perceived as an endorsement of the Turkish leader, who is widely derided for leading his country down the path of autocracy with rampant human rights violations. Germany’s surprise first-round exit from the 2018 World Cup in Russia produced a convenient brickbat to target Özil with, and it was compounded by the vitriol directed at him. From DFB (German Football Association) president Reinhard Grindel to the legendary skipper Lothar Matthäus to sections of the media, the Arsenal playmaker spared no one as he alleged they had “disrespected his Turkish roots” and “selfishly turned [him] into political propaganda.” The episode has unravelled at a time when Germany is at a crossroads — over whether to move forward and forge a more cosmopolitan, open society or retreat into its nationalistic past. Özil, apart from his immigrant background, is a practising Muslim, and when Germany won the 2014 World Cup he was the poster boy of the DFB’s efforts to make football inclusive. That one international failure — which could be explained purely in footballing terms — can lead to such a vile debate clearly indicates the fault lines. “I am German when we win, but an immigrant when we lose,” lamented the 29-year-old. To have his loyalty questioned even after he gave up his Turkish passport in order to play for Germany must have been distressing. However, Özil has unwittingly walked into an unnecessary controversy over a sensitive issue. Meeting President Erdoğan may have been “about respecting the highest office of his family’s country”, but he should have been mindful of the fact that Germany and Turkey shared a tenuous relationship, with the Turkish President having accused Angela Merkel’s government of being stuck in Germany’s Nazi past. And when a minister in the Turkish Cabinet termed Özil’s move to quit as the “most beautiful goal against the virus of fascism”, it hit Germany where it hurt the most. When Özil said he had “two hearts, one German, one Turkish,” he was attempting a delicate balancing act, favouring integration — a cherished modern-day value — over assimilation. Little did he expect that it would be so rough a ride..

He said that the Constitution should be torn up on two grounds: first, that it is based on Western ideas written by Anglophile lawyers and is in the wrong language. That happens to be true, we can do nothing about it. The second and more far-reaching objection was that the Constitution rests on a false premise. He says it has the wrong idea of what a nation is. The Constitution assumes [that a] nation called India is a territory called India and all the people living in it. Wrong, he says, a nation is not territory but its people. The people of India are the Hindu people and the Constitution should have been written for the Hindu people and the Hindu Rashtra.

Because it means that anybody who is not a Hindu or is not willing to identify himself as a Hindu is either a guest or an interloper.

One said that religion should be the determinant of nationhood.

The other said that we are fighting for the rights of everybody and that was the idea of India.

Now, India still reflects this idea. Pakistan reflects their idea in the worst form. Why would these people advocate an idea which is a mirror image of Pakistan? That was my point. My point was not that Hindus are in any way like Pakistan; it was a rejection of Pakistan and an assertion of the idea that a majority of Indian Hindus will not be in that Pakistan.

The Prime Minister says the Constitution is his holy book and Deen Dayal Upadhyay is his ideologue. The two ideas are incompatible.

The BJP is competing for the Hindutva votes. Hinduism is not Hindutva. Hinduism is a religious identity of 80% of our population and Hindutva is a political ideology of, I dare say, 20% of our population.

So I would say we are secular in the sense that we want the state to be distant from religion, we don’t want a Hindu Rashtra.

So I would say we are secular in the sense that we want the state to be distant from religion, we don’t want a Hindu Rashtra. But that does not mean we have no personal religion ourselves. There are very many Hindus in the Congress. Their Hinduism is a Hinduism of acceptance, coexistence. Such Hindus will be ashamed of people lynching an innocent man on the grounds of his religion, of a cap on his head, of the meat he is carrying, or that he is herding cows.

The Congress is secular in the sense that we want the state to be distant from religion, we don’t want a Hindu Rashtra. That does not mean we have no personal religion ourselves.

Over 34% of India’s current population lives in urban areas, rising by 3% since 2011.

An important conundrum is whether the Congress can emerge as a meaningful alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its Hindu majoritarian politics. On the evidence of its campaign so far, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the party appears to have chosen the path of least resistance. Given that these two States also happen to.

The party of Hinduism? G. Sampath   G. Sampath November 08, 2018 00:00 IST Updated: November 08, 2018 03:36 IST Liberals hoping that Rahul Gandhi’s Congress would rescue them from Hindutva may be in for a rude awakening The stage is all set for Assembly elections in five States — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana. Described as a ‘semi-final’ for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, they offer a foretaste of the electoral strategies likely to be on view next year. Though State and national elections often have their own specific dynamic, some useful inferences may be drawn from the campaigns of the national parties, especially the Congress. An important conundrum is whether the Congress can emerge as a meaningful alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its Hindu majoritarian politics. On the evidence of its campaign so far, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the party appears to have chosen the path of least resistance. Given that these two States also happen to be among those where the BJP’s Hindutva dimension is in full bloom, they presented the Congress with a good opportunity to test its political counter to the divisive agenda of its adversary. The combination of high anti-incumbency and a two-way contest with the BJP meant that the Congress could have taken the ideological battle to the Sangh Parivar. Wooing the upper castes But the Congress did nothing of the sort. It steered clear of the BJP’s majoritarian depredations, and opted to woo the same upper castes that constitute the BJP’s core vote base. It has embraced what has come to be known as ‘soft Hindutva’. In Madhya Pradesh, for instance, the Congress has promised to build cow shelters in every village if voted to power — this in a State where desperate farmers were fired upon by the administration. In Kerala, its State unit has played along with so-called religious sentiment, opposing the entry of women (between the ages of 10-50) in Sabarimala instead of standing by the constitutional principle of equality. In Rajasthan, too, the Congress’s game plan is to retrieve the upper caste vote from the BJP. Hindutva politics has queered the pitch in such a way that today no party can specifically woo the savarna voter without pandering to communal sentiment. In effect, this means not confronting the infusion of religion into the heart of democratic politics. Conversely, challenging it would require two things from a party: certain ideological non-negotiables, among which, in the case of the Congress, would be the Nehruvian legacy of secularism and a politics of caste rooted in the principle of social justice. Given the cynicism that has become commonplace in public discourse, it is fashionable to scoff at any expectation of principles in politics. But it is delusional to imagine that the very realpolitik that unleashed the genie of communal hatred on national politics will also be able — now that its disruptions are coming home to roost — to put that genie back into the constitutional bottle. In fact, the most troubling takeaway from the Congress’s approach to these Assembly polls is that even an outright victory for a Congress-led alliance in 2019, however improbable it may seem at present, may not really signify a defeat of communal forces. The clearest indication yet that the Congress cannot be expected to counter the normalisation of Hindu majoritarianism came during party president Rahul Gandhi’s campaign tour in Madhya Pradesh, where he stated that the “Congress was a party of Hinduism”. He prefaced it by saying that it was “not a party of Hindutva” but the fact that he felt compelled to paint the Congress in Hindu colours marks a clear shift in the party’s overt political line. For some time now, there has been a debate on the Congress’s use of ‘soft Hindutva’ as a counter to the BJP’s presumably ‘hard’ Hindutva. Mr. Gandhi’s supporters have argued that what has been labelled as ‘soft Hindutva’ is nothing but a free and open expression of his personal faith as a devout Hindu. Even if this were true, his temple visits, which rarely seem to take place without a photo-op, the recent emergence of vermilion on his forehead, his pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar, and his coming out as a Shiv bhakt, are all gestures saturated with political significance. Smart politics? They could either be read as a smart political response to the widespread ‘Hinduisation’ of the socio-political sphere, or as an admission of defeat to Hindutva forces, for this is exactly what they seek — an India where Hindu identity would be the starting point of any mobilisation for political power. Last month, a Rajasthan Minister was booked for violating the Representation of the People Act after he gave a speech asking all Hindus to vote for the BJP. Mr. Gandhi has never verbalised such a plea with regard to his own party. But can we truly characterise his description of the Congress as a “party of Hinduism”, or his embodiment of Hindu symbolism on the campaign trail, as actions in keeping with either the spirit of the Representation of the People Act or the secularism the Constitution speaks of? There are other aspects of this symbolism-driven ‘soft Hindutva’ that are as troubling: an overriding anxiety not to be seen as sympathetic to Muslims; and a low key yet consistent messaging that underscores Mr. Gandhi’s position at the apex of the caste hierarchy as a “ janeu -wearing Hindu”. The phrase, used by a Congress spokesperson after Mr. Gandhi’s visit to the Somnath temple last year, was invoked by a BJP leader recently in the context of yet another temple visit by Mr. Gandhi, when he asked, “What kind of janeu-dhari are you? What is your gotra ?” The focus on Mr. Gandhi’s caste pedigree once again reveals how temple politics is never without its attendant caste politics. Put simply, it gives the lie to Mr. Gandhi’s self-serving distinction between Hindutva and Hinduism, a distinction that is also becoming increasingly popular among an influential section of Indian liberals who, much like Mr. Gandhi, seem to have suddenly woken up to their Hindu identity in the last four years. For these ‘proud Hindus’, one of whom has recently penned a bestselling book on why he is one, the classical secularist position that one’s religion is a private matter and not an instrument to garner social or political capital is, of course, past its sell-by date. The distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva — which only matters because of the political uses of religion —rests on two premises. First, that Hinduism is inclusive and progressive, while Hindutva is exclusionary and regressive; second, that Hinduism is individualistic and preaches tolerance, whereas Hindutva is a supremacist ideology that deploys angry mobs to subjugate other religious communities. On Sangh Parivar’s page While this is, no doubt, an interesting distinction, it is even more interesting that no Hindutva ideologue has ever expressed any discomfort with this definition of Hinduism that categorically rejects Hindutva. If anything, representatives of the Sangh Parivar have been pleased with the transformation of the Congress president into a tilak-wearing, temple-hopping ‘Hindu politician’. The Congress becoming more ‘Hindu’ is but another sign of savarna consolidation, a movement of which Hindutva is the flag-bearer. Mr. Gandhi’s version of non-threatening Hinduism and the Parivar’s aggressive Hindutva are in complete agreement on one issue: caste. They both want to be the party of choice for the upper castes, and so long as this remains the case, the Congress cannot be expected to operationalise in its politics the principle of equality. In other words, liberals and other good-hearted people hoping that Mr. Gandhi and the Congress would rescue them from Hindutva may be in for a rude awakening. As is well known, god doesn’t help those who don’t help themselves. sampath.g@thehindu.co.in.

Indira Gandhi was the first woman to present a Budget in 1970, when she was the Prime Minister. Her Finance Minister Morarji Desai had resigned from the Cabinet, prompting her to retain the Finance portfolio for a year.

Only a sentence of two years and above will attract disqualification under the Representation of the People Act. Sedition, or Section 124A of the IPC, is not one of the offences that entail disqualification, regardless of the length of the jail term.

“Section 124 A IPC also attracts intention or tendency to create disorder or disturbance to law and order or incitement to violence... Whether that act resulted in violence is immaterial. The charge under Section 124 A IPC stands proved.” She also imposed a Rs. 10,000 fine. After taking a look at the judgment, Mr. Vaiko objected to an observation that he had sought “lenient punishment”.

The first Budget of the second Modi government appeared to be of a continuum of the last with an emphasis on social welfare. This includes a bank overdraft facility of Rs. 5000 for women members of Self Help Groups (SHG) and an identification with the poor, while the rich (those with incomes between Rs. 2 and 5 crore and Rs. 5 crore and above) have been hit with a hike in surcharge.

The political optics of taxing the rich is quite potent and the government appears mindful of that.

There was a lot of stress on infrastructure development, including tax relief for affordable housing, with a proposed tax holiday for developers of affordable housing and an additional deduction of upto Rs. 1.5 lakh for interest on home loans borrowed upto March 31, 2020.

Audit report reveals irregularities within scam-hit Vyapam Testing times:The head office of the Mandhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board in Bhopal.A. M. Faruqui   Sidharth Yadav Bhopal, July 29, 2019 00:00 IST Updated: July 29, 2019 06:08 IST Recruitments were carried out during two years under false premises For at least two financial years after the Vyapam scam was uncovered in Madhya Pradesh in July 2013, administrative and financial irregularities running into crores of rupees continued unchecked within the examination board, reveals an audit report. Glaring irregularities such as unjustified recruitment of volunteers, posting of security guards hired by Vyapam at private bungalows, recruitment of officials on fake community certificates, and the use of whitener and overwriting in cash books, have come to the fore in the audit report for 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. The Directorate of Local Fund Audit of the Department of Finance in its report submitted to Vyapam in 2017 stated such irregularities “were an open invitation to fraud and embezzlement”. In almost all the instances of financial irregularities, it said “related persons/officials” had to repay the board for the funds used. The Hindu is in possession of a copy of the report. Scam rekindled The scam has been rekindled as State Home Minister Bala Bachchan recently said the government did not possess the anonymous letter received by the Indore Police on June 20, 2013, that blew the lid off the scam. The scam involved 13 different examinations conducted by the Vyapam or the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board for recruitment to government jobs and admissions to educational institutions in the State. In August 2013, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government constituted a Special Task Force to probe the scam. The Central Bureau of Investigation took over in July 2015. In the two years, while the STF was investigating the scam, several officials were recruited to the board on a false premise. “The board, a respectable organisation which recruits personnel in other Departments, itself has recruited personnel on fake SC/ST certificates, which shows the absence of vigilance within it,” says the report. ‘Against rules’ Moreover, the team noted that in 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the board hired volunteers and daily wage workers “against the rules and in an objectionable way” and paid them Rs. 1,21,94,751 as salary. “It is unclear which work were the volunteers required for, in what numbers and of what category. It is unclear through which process they were recruited and for how long, whether there were vacancies and the work done by them monitored,” says the report. “In the absence of permission from the government to create posts for these volunteers, the payment made to these volunteers stands nullified and should be recovered from individual payers,” says the report. The report says Rs. 14,25,952 was paid to 23 volunteers in 2013-2014 and 13 in 2014-2015, although they had “not signed against their names” in the attendance records. Notes from officials The volunteers received their salaries based on notes sent by higher officials. “In the records, in some places in front of their names ‘Secretary’ or ‘honourable Minister’ was found to be written,” the report reveals. In 2013-2014, as much as Rs. 2,14,925 was paid to guards of Krishna Security, a Bhopal-based firm, from the board’s coffers, but they were posted at private houses and bungalows. ‘Neglect of duty’ Moreover, in the cash books of the financial years audited, says the report, several figures under the cash and bank columns had been changed using whitener or by overwriting, without being attested by the competent authority. The team noted that the use of whitener “could make fraud possible and thereby damage the credibility of the board”. “The scam wouldn’t have happened in the first place if there was an internal audit of confidential payments,” said State Law Minister P.C. Sharma. He said he was not aware of the audit report..

The point of the story is this: “Two Gun” Crowley didn’t blame himself for anything.

Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding’s cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome—oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy.

Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding’s cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome—oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy. Did Secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a “loan” of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court—and blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.

Let’s realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons.

Let’s realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home.

Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”.

Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.

“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. “There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”.

“Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”.

“If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”.

They don’t realize that neither you nor I want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems. And if salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won’t need to sell us. We’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying—not being sold.

“People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.”.

# Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life (Lamott, Anne)

But the idea of spending entire days in someone else’s office doing someone else’s work did not suit my father’s soul.

One of the gifts of being a writer is that it gives you an excuse to do things, to go places and explore. Another is that writing motivates you to look closely at life, at life as it lurches by and tramps around.

Make mistakes, and that Thurber was right when he said, "You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backwards.".

Understood immediately the thrill of seeing oneself in print. It provides some sort of primal verification: you are in print; therefore you exist. Who knows what this urge is all about, to appear somewhere outside yourself, instead of feeling stuck inside your muddled but stroboscopic mind, peering out like a little undersea animal— a spiny blenny, for instance—from inside your tiny cave? Seeing yourself in print.

Who knows what this urge is all about, to appear somewhere outside yourself, instead of feeling stuck inside your muddled but stroboscopic mind, peering out like a little undersea animal— a spiny blenny, for instance—from inside your tiny cave?.

"for a life oriented to leisure is in the end a life oriented to death—the greatest leisure of all.".

Throughout my childhood I believed that what I thought about was different from what other kids thought about. It was not necessarily more profound, but there was a struggle going on inside me to find some sort of creative or spiritual or aesthetic way of seeing the world and organizing it in my head.

Read more than other kids; I luxuriated in books. Books were my refuge. I sat in corners with my little finger hooked over my bottom lip, reading, in a trance, lost in the places and times to which books took me. And there was a moment during my junior year in high school when I began to believe that I could do what other writers were doing. I came to believe that I might be able to put a pencil in my hand and make something magical happen.

I felt that in my strange new friends and in certain new books, I was meeting my other half. Some people wanted to get rich or famous, but my friends and I wanted to get real. We wanted to get deep. (Also, I suppose, we wanted to get laid.).

"a zoo of lusts, a bedlam of ambitions, a nursery of fears, a harem of fondled hatreds.".

Short stories instead. "Do it every day for a while," my father kept saying. "Do it as you would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do it as a debt of honor. And make a commitment to finishing things.".

I heard a preacher say recently that hope is a revolutionary patience;.

I heard a preacher say recently that hope is a revolutionary patience; let me add that so is being a writer. Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don’t give up.

Writing has so much to give, so much to teach, so many surprises. That thing you had to force yourself to do—the actual act of writing—turns out to be the best part. It’s like discovering that while you thought you needed the tea ceremony for the caffeine, what you really needed was the tea ceremony. The act of writing turns out to be its own reward.

Good writing is about telling the truth.

We are a species that needs and wants to understand who we are.

Start with your childhood, I tell them. Plug your nose and jump in, and write down all your memories as truthfully as you can. Flannery O’Connor said that anyone who survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life. Maybe your childhood was grim and horrible, but grim and horrible is Okay if it is well done. Don’t worry about doing it well yet, though. Just start getting it down.

"his heels hitting heavily on the pavement at first but with an effortless gathering out of a kind of sweet panic growing lighter and quicker and quieter, he runs. Ah: runs. Runs.".

E. L. Doctorow once said that "writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." You don’t have to see where you’re going, you don’t have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best.

E. L. Doctorow once said that "writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." You don’t have to see where you’re going, you don’t have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice about writing, or life, I have ever heard.

"Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.".

Typing fully formed passages as fast as a court reporter. But this is just the fantasy of the uninitiated.

"It’s not like you don’t have a choice, because you do—you can either type or kill yourself.".

A friend of mine says that the first draft is the down draft—you just get it down. The second draft is the up draft—you fix it up. You try to say what you have to say more accurately. And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth, to see if it’s loose or cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy.

Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft. I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won’t have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren’t even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they’re doing it.

Perfectionism means that you try desperately not to leave so much mess to clean up. But clutter and mess show us that life is being lived.

They cramp around our wounds—the pain from our childhood, the losses and disappointments of adulthood, the humiliations suffered in both—to keep us from getting hurt in the same place again, to keep foreign substances out.

That awareness is learning to keep yourself company. And then learn to be more compassionate company, as if you were somebody you are fond of and wish to encourage. I doubt that you would read a close friend’s early efforts and, in his or her presence, roll your eyes and snicker. I doubt that you would pantomime sticking your finger down your throat. think you might say something along the lines of, "Good for you.

I doubt that you would pantomime sticking your finger down your throat. think you might say something along the lines of, "Good for you. We can work out some of the problems later, but for now, full steam ahead!".

But some days the smoke is faint and you just have to follow it as best you can, sniffing away.

Still, even on those days, you might notice how great perseverance feels.

And the next day the scent may seem stronger—or it may just be that you are developing a quiet doggedness. This is priceless. Perfectionism, on the other hand, will only drive you mad.

"When I write, I feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth.".

Perfectionism is a mean, frozen form of idealism, while messes are the artist’s true friend.

What people somehow (inadvertently, I’m sure) forgot to mention when we were children was that we need to make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here—and, by extension, what we’re supposed to be writing.

Now, you also want to ask yourself how they stand, what they carry in their pockets or purses, what happens in their faces and to their posture when they are thinking, or bored, or afraid. Whom would they have voted for last time? Why should we care about them anyway? What would be the first thing they stopped doing if they found out they had six months to live? Would they start smoking again? Would they keep flossing?.

Bad things happen to good characters, because our actions have consequences, and we do not all behave perfectly all the time.

But no matter what, you are probably going to have to let bad things happen to some of the characters you love or you won’t have much of a story. Bad things happen to good characters, because our actions have consequences, and we do not all behave perfectly all the time.

One line of dialogue that rings true reveals character in a way that pages of description can’t.

"Nothing is as important as a likable narrator. Nothing holds a story together better.".

Having a likable narrator is like having a great friend whose company you love, whose mind you love to pick, whose running commentary totally holds your attention, who makes you laugh out loud, whose lines you always want to steal.

They shouldn’t be too perfect; perfect means shallow and unreal and fatally uninteresting.

Like for them to have a nice sick sense of humor and to be concerned with important things, by which I mean that they are interested in political and psychological and spiritual matters.

I want them to want to know who we are and what life is all about. I like them to be mentally ill in the same sorts of ways that I am; for instance, I have a friend who said one day, "I could resent the ocean if I tried," and realized that I love that in a guy.

Try to tell it to you. One final reminder: you probably won’t know your characters until weeks or months after you’ve started working with them. Frederick Buechner wrote:.

You leave some measure of real freedom for your characters to be themselves. And if minor characters show an inclination to become major characters, as they’re apt to do, you at least give them a shot at it, because in the world of fiction it may take many pages before you find out who the major characters really are, just as in the real world it may take you many years to find out that the stranger you talked to once for half an hour in the railroad station may have done more to point you to where your true homeland lies than your priest or your best friend or even your psychiatrist.

Dream must be vivid and continuous—because.

Also, you may not be able to see the problems, because in finding your characters and their story, you are trying to describe something by feel and not by sight.

Second, remember that you should be able to identify each character by what he or she says. Each one must sound different from the others. And they should not all sound like you; each one must have a self.

The garden is one of the two great metaphors for humanity.

The garden is one of the two great metaphors for humanity. The other, of course, is the river.

Metaphors are a great language tool, because they explain the unknown in terms of the known.

Didn’t know where to start, but I did know that the garden did not start out as metaphor. It started out as paradise. Then, as now, the garden is about life and beauty and the impermanence of all living things. The garden is about feeding your children, providing food for the tribe. It’s part of an urgent territorial drive that we can probably trace back to animals storing food. It’s a competitive display mechanism, like having a prize bull, this greed for the best tomatoes and English tea roses; it’s about winning, about providing society with superior things, and about proving that you have taste and good values and you work hard.

"You don’t love to garden?" they’d ask incredulously, and I’d shake my head and not mention that what I love are cut flowers, because this sounds so violent and decadent, like when Salvador Dalí said his favorite animal was fillet of sole.

I talked earlier about the artist who is trying to capture something in one corner of his canvas but keeps discovering that what he has painted is not what he had in mind. He keeps covering his work over with white paint each time that he discovers what it isn’t, and each time this brings him closer to discovering what it is. This has happened again and again for me in writing. I may think I know who a certain character is or how an essay should proceed, so I make a stab at following this ghostly blueprint in my head. Then it turns out that I’ve been wrong, wrong about the character. I had the sandwich board she was wearing confused with who she really is. So I white it out and try again.

Kvetching.

Flails.

Tried not to make any big decisions about how to salvage the book or my writing life, because the one thing I knew for sure was that if you want to make God laugh, tell her your plans.

Your job is to present clearly your viewpoint, your line of vision. Your job is to see people as they really are, and to do this, you have to know who you are in the most compassionate possible sense.

If you find that you start a number of stories or pieces that you don’t ever bother finishing, that you lose interest or faith in them along the way, it may be that there is nothing at their center about which you care passionately. You need to put yourself at their center, you and what you believe to be true or right. The core, ethical concepts in which you most passionately believe are the language in which you are writing.

For instance, I used to think that paired opposites were a given, that love was the opposite of hate, right the opposite of wrong. But now I think we sometimes buy into these concepts because it is so much easier to embrace absolutes than to suffer reality. I don’t think anything is the opposite of love. Reality is unforgivingly complex.

Every human has something to cry about.

"The winds of solitude roaring at the edge of infinity.".

"Listen to your broccoli, and your broccoli will tell you how to eat it.".

Money won’t guarantee these writers much of anything, except that now they have a much more expensive set of problems. The pressure on their lives has actually intensified.

I went through a very bad bout of jealousy last year, when someone with whom I am (or rather was) friendly did extremely well. It felt like every few days she’d have more good news about how well her book was doing, until it seemed that she was going to be set for life. It threw me for a loop. I am a better writer than she is. A lot of my writer friends do very well, hugely well, and I’m not jealous of them. I do not know why that is, but it’s true. But when it happened for her, I would sit listening to her discuss her latest successes over the phone, praying that I could get off the line before I started barking. I was literally oozing unhappiness, like a sump.

My deepest belief is that to live as if we’re dying can set us free. Dying people teach you to pay attention and to forgive and not to sweat the small things.

I started telling myself that if you want to know how God feels about money, look at whom she gives it to.

I told myself that historically when people do too well too quickly, they are a Greek tragedy waiting to happen.

"A critic is someone who comes onto the battlefield after the battle is over and shoots the wounded"?.

Sam and I walked Bill and Adair up to their car after dinner. Crisp cold starry night. Bill, holding Sam, inhaled deeply. "Doesn’t it smell wonderful, Sam?" he said. Sam inhaled deeply, too, like he was smelling a delicious meal, looked off into space, and said, "It smells like moon.".

There are an enormous number of people out there with invaluable information to share with you, and all you have to do is pick up the phone. They love it when you do, just as you love it when people ask if they can pick your brain about something you happen to know a great deal about—or, as in my case, have a number of impassioned opinions on. Say you happen to know a lot about knots, or penguins, or cheeses, and the right person asks you to tell him or her everything you know. What a wonderful and rare experience. Usually what happens in real life is that people ask you questions you can’t remember the answer to, like what you came into the kitchen to get, or what happened on the Fourth of July in 1776, and you sit there thinking, "God, I knew that; it’s right there on the tip of my tongue, let’s see—Okay, wait, the Constitution? No, wait, shit, I used to know ... " When you do actually know a bit about something, it is such a pleasure to be asked a lot of questions about it.

"God! I’m so glad I took so few risks! I’m so glad I kept shooting so low!".

Thought she’d been very honest, and that this was totally commendable, but that you don’t always have to chop with the sword of truth. You can point with it, too.

"August in Waterton, Alberta": Above me, wind does its best to blow leaves off the aspen tree a month too soon. No use wind. All you succeed in doing is making music, the noise of failure growing beautiful.

In the first story of Donald Barthelme’s I ever read, twenty years ago, he said that truth is a hard apple to catch and it is a hard apple to throw. I know what a painful feeling it is when you’ve been.

In the first story of Donald Barthelme’s I ever read, twenty years ago, he said that truth is a hard apple to catch and it is a hard apple to throw.

I always show my work to one of two people before sending a copy to my editor or agent. I feel more secure and connected this way, and these two people get a lot of good work out of me. They are like midwives; there are these stories and ideas and visions and memories and plots inside me, and only I can give birth to them. Theoretically I could do it alone, but it sure makes it easier to have people helping.

The word block suggests that you are constipated or stuck, when the truth is that you’re empty. As I said in the last chapter, this emptiness can destroy some writers, as do the shame and frustration that go with it.

I remind myself of this when I cannot get any work done: to live as if I am dying, because the truth is we are all terminal on this bus. To live as if we are dying gives us a chance to experience some real presence. Time is so full for people who are dying in a conscious way, full in the way that life is for children. They spend big round hours. So instead of staring miserably at the computer screen trying to will my way into having a breakthrough, I say to myself, "Okay, hmmm, let’s see. Dying tomorrow. What should I do today?" Then I can decide to read Wallace Stevens for the rest of the morning or go to the beach or just really participate in ordinary life.

"Is life too short to be taking shit, or is life too short to be minding it?".

"Do you have any other really funny books about cancer?".

I heard a tape once in which an actor talked about trying to find God in the modern world and how, left to our own devices, we seek instead all the worldly things—possessions, money, looks, and power—because we think they will bring us fulfillment. But this turns out to be a joke, because they are just props, and when we check out of this life, we have to give them all back to the great propmaster in the sky. "They’re just on loan," he said. "They’re not ours." This tape changed how I felt about my students emulating their favorite writers. It helped me see that it is natural to take on someone else’s style, that it’s a prop that you use for a while until you have to give it back. And it just might take you to the thing that is not on loan, the thing that is real and true: your own voice.

The redemption in Beckett is so small: in the second act of Waiting for Godot, the barren dying twig of a tree has put out a leaf. Just one leaf. It’s not much; still Beckett didn’t commit suicide. He wrote.

You are going to have to give and give and give, or there’s no reason for you to be writing. You have to give from the deepest part of yourself, and you are going to have to go on giving, and the giving is going to have to be its own reward. There is no cosmic importance to your getting something published, but there is in learning to be a giver.

Here is the best true story on giving I know, and it was told by Jack Kornfield of the Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre. An eight-year-old boy had a younger sister who was dying of leukemia, and he was told that without a blood transfusion she would die. His parents explained to him that his blood was probably compatible with hers, and if so, he could be the blood donor. They asked him if they could test his blood. He said sure. So they did and it was a good match. Then they asked if he would give his sister a pint of blood, that it could be her only chance of living. He said he would have to think about it overnight. The next day he went to his parents and said he was willing to donate the blood. So they took him to the hospital where he was put on a gurney beside his six-year-old sister. Both of them were hooked up to IVs. A nurse withdrew a pint of blood from the boy, which was then put in the girl’s IV. The boy lay on his gurney in silence while the blood dripped into his sister; until the doctor came over to see how he was doing. Then the boy opened his eyes and asked, "How soon until I start to die?".

The first time you read through your galleys is heaven. The second time through, all you see are the typos no one caught. It looks like the typesetter typed it with frostbitten feet, drunk. And the typos are important ones. They make you look ignorant; they make you look like an ignorant racist. By the third or fourth time through, you can see that there is not one fresh or insightful or even salvageable line in the whole thing. By the fifth reading, you are no longer sure that publishing this would be in your best interests.

No one has expressed it better than a great novelist I heard once on a talk show who said something like "You want to know the price I pay for being a writer? Okay, I’ll tell you. I travel by plane a great deal. And I’m usually seated next to some huge businessman who works on files or his laptop computer for a while, and then notices me and asks me what I do. And I say I’m a writer. Then there’s always a terrible silence. Then he says eagerly, ’Have you written anything I might have heard of?’ "And that’s the price I pay for being a writer.".

I think I’ve told my students every single thing I know about writing. Short assignments, shitty first drafts, one-inch picture frames, Polaroids, messes, mistakes, partners.

"So why does our writing matter, again?" they ask. Because of the spirit, I say. Because of the heart. Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life: they feed the soul. When writers make us shake our heads with the exactness of their prose and their truths, and even make us laugh about ourselves or life, our buoyancy is restored. We are given a shot at dancing with, or at least clapping along with, the absurdity of life, instead of being squashed by it over and over again. It’s like singing on a boat during a terrible storm at sea. You can’t stop the raging storm, but singing can change the hearts and spirits of the people who are together on that ship.


# Completion Equipment

The minimum yield strength defines the minimum tensile strength in psi.However, since the tensile load is taken by the plain end area or wall section area of the pipe, the weight/foot of the pipe will also affect the tolerable tensile.


# Kerogen (aapg.org)

Geochemists define kerogen as the fraction of sedimentary organic constituent of sedimentary rocks that is insoluble in the usual organic solvents.

The types of kerogens present in a rock largely control the type of hydrocarbons generated in that rock.

The type of kerogen present determines source rock quality. The more oil prone a kerogen, the higher its quality.

The effect of different matrix constituents varies from strongest to weakest: illite > Ca-bentonite > kaolinite > Na-bentonite > calcium carbonate > gypsum. Variations in the mineral matrix effect related to organic richness occur in whole-rock samples with TOC values less than 10%.

Kerogen type III contains sufficient hydrogen to be gas generative but not enough hydrogen to be oil prone. In its pure form, it is composed of vitrinite, a maceral formed from land plant wood. As with other intermediate kerogen types, however, various maceral mixtures or degradational processes can contribute to kerogen type III formation.

Kerogen type IV is a term not universally employed by organic geochemists because it is difficult to distinguish type IV from type III using only Rock-Eval pyrolysis.


# How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One (Fish, Stanley)

“When you write you lay out a line of words. The line of words is a miner’s pick, a woodcarver’s gouge, a surgeon’s probe. You wield it and it digs a path you follow.” And when you come to the end of the path, you have a sentence.

Alone a word is just a word, a part of speech clustered in a category; it looks over at other words it would like to have a relationship with (it’s almost a dating situation) but has no way of connecting with them.

Alone a word is just a word, a part of speech clustered in a category; it looks over at other words it would like to have a relationship with (it’s almost a dating situation) but has no way of connecting with them. And then a verb shows up, providing a way of linking up noun to adjective, and suddenly you have a sentence, a proposition, a little world. “Beautiful Joan sighed.” “John was angry.” “I am proud.” “Crucial decisions await.” And on and on forever.

That’s the basic logical structure of many sentences: X does Y to Z. (Sentences can also come without objects, as in “Joe walks.”) “Simon bought the car.” “The government raised taxes.” “The corporation gives bonuses.” “Heat parches lawns.” The instances are infinite, although the form remains the same (this is a key point, and I shall return to it): doer, doing, done to.

It’s like being able to reel off the locations on a baseball field—first base, second base, third base, home plate, left field, right field, center field, pitcher’s mound—without having the slightest clue as to how they function in a game. You can talk the talk, but you can’t walk the walk. Not only is that kind of abstract knowledge.

Nine times out of ten when I ask someone to pick out the verb (the designator of the action) in the sentence “Helping old ladies cross the street prevents accidents,” the first answer I will hear is “Helping” and the second I will hear is “cross.” And were I to ask what is the sentence’s subject (an unhappy grammatical term because it suggests theme or content), the answer most likely would be “old ladies.” People make these mistakes because they think that whenever something they recognize as a noun turns up, it must be the subject of the sentence, or that whenever they recognize a verbal form, it must be the sentence’s main verb. They confuse a taxonomy of the parts of speech with an analysis of a sentence’s logical structure. The two are entirely distinct. You can’t tell anything about the function a word plays in a sentence by identifying it as a noun or a verb. “Old ladies” is certainly a noun (or more precisely a noun phrase), and “Helping” and “cross” are certainly verbal forms, but the subject of the sentence is whatever performs its action, and in this case it is the compound phrase “Helping old ladies cross the street”; the main verb of the sentence is whatever action is being performed, and in this case it is the action “prevents.”.

But if one understands that a sentence is a structure of logical relationships and that the number of relationships involved is finite, one understands too that there is only one error to worry about, the error of being illogical, and only one rule to follow: make sure that every component of your sentences is related to the other components in a way that is clear and unambiguous (unless ambiguity is what you are aiming at). And how do you do that? Not by learning rules, but by coming to know the limited number of relationships your words, phrases, and clauses can enter into, and becoming alert to those times when the relationships are not established or are unclear: when a phrase just dangles in space, when a connective has nothing to connect to, when a prepositional phrase is in search of a verb to complement, when a pronoun cannot be paired with a noun.

“They say that money talks, but I say money corrupts.” You might think that disagreeing is a “natural” act, requiring no formal skills. But disagreeing is a learned activity; it is more than just saying no; it involves giving reasons for your rejection of what others have said.

That is why the prescriptive advice you often get in books like Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style—write short sentences, be direct, don’t get lost in a maze of piled-up clauses, avoid the passive voice, place yourself in the background, employ figures of speech sparingly—is useful only in relation to some purposes, and unfortunate in relation to others.

“A stitch in time saves nine.” “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” “Out of sight, out of mind.” “Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “An apple a day keeps the doctor away.” “Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.”.

King is replying to the question (sometimes asked by his colleagues in the movement) “Why don’t you wait a while and hold back on the sit-ins and marches?” The answer is at once withheld and given. It is formally withheld by the succession of “when” clauses (the technical name is anaphora), that offer themselves as preliminary to the direct assertion but are the direct assertion; each “when” clause is presented as a piece of the answer, but is in itself fully sufficient as an answer. “Here is the reason we can’t wait,” each says, but if that isn’t enough, here is another and another. As the huge dependent clause (a clause that does not stand alone as a complete sentence) grows and grows, the independent clause—the sentence’s supposedly main assertion—becomes less and less necessary.

Who announces (in “A Consideration Upon Cicero”), “I write naturally and without a plan; the first stroke of the pen just leads to a second.”.

The word “essay” means to try out, test, probe. In the essay style, successive clauses and sentences are not produced by an overarching logic, but by association; the impression the prose gives is that it can go anywhere in a manner wholly unpredictable.

# Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging - (petrowiki.org)

Measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei (protons) contained within the fluid-filled pore space of porous media (reservoir rocks).

Because these protons primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example:.

NMR logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present, the properties of these fluids, and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids.

T1 describes how quickly the protons align within the static magnetic field.

T1 describes how quickly the protons align within the static magnetic field. The T1 curve is an exponential curve that characterizes the rate of change of the proton magnetization.

T1 is the time at which the magnetization reaches 63% of its final value, and three times T1 is the time at which 95% polarization is achieved.

Large values of T1 (measured in milliseconds) correspond to weak coupling between the fluid and its surrounding environment and a slow approach to magnetic equilibrium, whereas, small T1 values represent strong coupling and a rapid approach to equilibrium. Different fluids, such as water, oil, and gas, have very different T1 values. T1 is directly related to pore size and viscosity.

Pulse NMR devices use precisely timed bursts (pulse sequences) of RF energy that generate an oscillating magnetic field (B1) that tilts or "tips" the aligned protons perpendicular (x-y plane) to the direction of the applied magnetic field. The application of B1 results in a change in energy state that causes the protons to precess in phase to one another. These changes are known as NMR.

When the B1 field is turned off, the precessions of the protons are no longer in phase with one another, and the net magnetization decreases. In this situation, a receiver coil (antenna) that measures magnetization in the transverse direction will detect an exponential decaying signal called free-induction decay (FID);.

The process of spins lossing their coherence due to magnetic field inhomogeneity is not a true "relaxation" process and is dependent on the location of the molecule in the magnet field distirbution. Therefore, the FID decay constant is often referred as T2* rather than T2.

The primary objectives in NMR logging are measuring T1 signal amplitude (as a function of polarization), T2 signal amplitude and decay, and their distributions.

The total signal amplitude is proportional to the total hydrogen content and is calibrated to give formation porosity independent of lithology effects.

In NMR logging, T1 measurement initially required either a stationary mode or very slow logging speeds.

T2 measurement uses the spin-echo technique, in which the protons are first tipped into the transverse (x-y) plane by a 90° RF pulse and then inverted (flipped) by a subsequent 180° RF pulse at a fixed-time interval to rephase the dephasing protons.


# Carlson, M.R.-Practical Reservoir Simulation - Using, Assessing, and Developing Results-PennWell (2006)_k2opt

With experience, it becomes painfully obvious— many reservoir engineering estimates, plans, and schemes have fundamental ﬂaws. In some cases, it is possible to identify a wrong assumption as the central cause of the problem. Unfortunately, this is not the norm. Most often, it will be attributed to a combination of things; some.

Screening Most reservoir engineering textbooks do not have a section dealing with how to screen the input data. There are no examples of bad data. The point is that doing a reservoir simulation probably will put most practicing engineers into new territory.

On a philosophical note, the essence of Buddhism is ignorance is our sole enemy. In simplistic terms, it replaces sin. This general concept is sometimes coined lifelong learning.

As a reservoir matures and more.

At the other extreme, some petroleum engineers are convinced reservoir engineering analysis is so theoretical as to be of no practical application. Do not believe this. Most senior engineering managers, vice presidents, and quite a few presidents have a reservoir engineering background.

One of the most important skills is the ability to recognize good and bad input data.

The input to the simulator is tuned.The model is run with the historical base product production speciﬁed—usually oil. The idea is to match GORs, water cuts, and pressures predicted by the model to actual performance.This part of the study is usually the most timeconsuming, normally averaging one-third of total study time. The permeability × height (kh) or bottomhole pressure (bhp) of the wells is then adjusted so base product production matches actual ﬁeld performance.

In order to make predictions, the kh, or bottomhole pressure, of all wells must be adjusted to match actual production performance.This involves a series of trial and error runs to obtain the correct values.

Stage.At the end of the tuning phase the model is usually terminated with a restart.This input data ﬁle contains all of the information necessary to continue a simulation at a later time.

The assumptions on which a simulation is based should be outlined. Simulation also generates an enormous amount of paper output. It takes considerable time and ingenuity to reduce this data to an understandable form from a commonsense perspective.

First, almost all reservoir data is in the public domain.

The author has spent a great deal of time in Western Canada and has experience on reservoirs in Peru, Bangladesh, India, Australia, Indonesia, and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) as well. The.

A number of factors, such as basin maturity and geological controls, were considered in preparing this ﬁgure; however, it is logical to extrapolate exploration success with increased information. This was—and is—the purpose of making the data public.

Correctly applied, reservoir simulation can be a powerful tool. It is extremely dangerous if applied incorrectly. It is a similar to riding a high-performance sailboat in a big wind. If you don’t respect it, you will likely get hurt. If you fear it (or are overawed by it), you will not be able to control it, and you will end up in the drink. You can never take your eyes off what is happening and where you are going, because something unpredictable will happen when you do. It takes time and practice to become good. Sailing is not for everyone but is addictive to others. Each study will be a variation on a common theme. However, the emphasis on the various components in different studies will change with individual reservoirs and the stage of the reservoir in its production life cycle.

The author participated in a course taught by Dr. A. Settari, which required a simulator be built as a class project. This problem set had a reputation for being long, involved, and difﬁcult.

Reading pages of differential equations and matrices is not the same as actually programming a simulator.

The development of the partial differential equations is the same for a reservoir simulator as for pressure transient analysis.

First, a description of the behavior of the ﬂuids at different pressures is required—an equation of state; and, second, an interblock transport relation is required.

For gas, the real gas law is used. • The liquid phase has dissolved gas, which is a linear function of pressure (black oil). • Water is characterized as a liquid of low compressibility, which is a linear function of pressure.

The intrinsic property of the rock is termed permeability. Note there is a breakdown at high Reynolds numbers.

Directions. This directional change in permeability is not directly programmed into reservoir simulators, as.

This level of error is considered tolerable in the majority of cases.

There are certain cases where this error is not acceptable. Probably the most common is in thermal simulation where adverse mobility ratios (i.e., much greater than one) exist in displacements. Gas (steam) displacement of viscous oil—i.e., heavy oil—is a classic example. The converse, where oil displaces gas, does not cause problems.

This case, the differential equations are formed differently: ﬂow is allowed diagonally between grid blocks.

The solution to this equation is not going to be solved exactly. Approximate solutions are going to be developed at certain ﬁxed points in space and, as the simulator marches through certain ﬁxed points, in time. Thus, two discretizations occur, one in space and the other in time.

One is called a block-centered grid and the other a pointcentered grid. The boundary conditions for these two types of grids are different; however, all of the commercial simulators use block-centered grids.

Time discretization is accomplished with timesteps. These are also arbitrarily chosen.

The accuracy of the solution.

Smaller grid blocks and shorter timesteps provide more accurate solutions.

In order to handle the large volumes of computational data, matrices are used to solve these problems.

The solution at time n + 1 is on the left side. On the far left-hand side are all of the spatial terms, which are made up of permeability and grid-block dimensions. The next term, on the right-hand side, represents the length of the timestep and the previous solution (pressures and grid-block production rates), which completes the information necessary to project the solution at the end of the timestep.

The initial solution or pressures must be set to start the simulation and a series of grid-block values are obtained from the simulator at discrete points in time.

Regular grid, the error is proportional to the spacing squared.

Regular grid, the error is proportional to the spacing squared. For an irregular grid, the error is directly related to the spacing.

Is not possible to determine the absolute level of error from this technique, only how it varies with spacing. Therefore, to determine the absolute level of error, it is necessary to compare a computer simulation with an analytical solution.

These analytical solutions are only available for certain geometries, and, as a result, the accuracy of most real simulations cannot be determined absolutely.

However, multiple runs made with different grid spacing can be compared to each other, which indicates convergence to a consistent solution is rapid and changes in solutions are of.

However, multiple runs made with different grid spacing can be compared to each other, which indicates convergence to a consistent solution is rapid and changes in solutions are of a small magnitude. This is called a grid sensitivity.

Therefore, it is practical to test the accuracy of a grid using multiple simulation runs. These sensitivities need not be performed on the entire grid. It is generally sufﬁ- cient to make a grid for a small group of wells, which feature the important mechanisms in the reservoir. This allows detailed (small dimension) grid blocks to be explored with realistic simulation execution.

Turbulent ﬂow is described by the Forcheimer equation,.

The base differential equations for pressure transient analysis and reservoir simulation.

The base differential equations for pressure transient analysis and reservoir simulation are the same, although in different coordinate forms: ∂ 2 p ∂ c = p φµ ∂ x 2 ∂ t k ∂ 2 p 1 ∂ p ϕµ c ∂ p 2 + = ∂ rr ∂ r k ∂ t (2.7) (2.8) 2 0 < It is natural to ask is why reservoir simulators are not formulated based on pseudo pressures. The answer is they can. It is even possible to assign a pseudo pressure to oil. The use of pseudo pressure linearizes the 1/µz when dealing with gas. In a reservoir simulation, these factors are all calculated for time.

The use of pseudo pressure linearizes the 1/µz when dealing with gas. In a reservoir simulation, these factors are all calculated.

Implicit versus explicit solutions (formulation/practical knowledge) Using a simplified single-phase example can be solved in two ways. The ﬁrst assumes the pressure gradients in space don’t change much between timesteps.

Implicit versus explicit solutions (formulation/practical knowledge) Using a simplified single-phase example can be solved in two ways. The ﬁrst assumes the pressure gradients in space don’t change much between timesteps. Therefore, the solution at time n + 1 can be estimated from existing values of pressure. This is known as an explicit solution.

After a few experiments, the prediction of the solution at time n + 1 is improved if one takes the solution from time n + 1 and averages it with the original solution at time n, yielding an average effective pressure of (P n+1 + P n )/2 for the iteration. This updated average pressure is then used to reestimate the pressure at time n + 1. The variation in each successive estimate of the solution at time n + 1 is observable using the average pressure across the timestep. The difference between successive iterations can be set at a tolerance deﬁning convergence, and a form of control is introduced. This is known as an implicit solution.

Explicit solutions are based on the solution at the last timestep, and only one leap forward in time is made. Implicit solutions are based on both the previous and current solution and involve multiple estimates of the solution at time n +.

Caused problems in generating the basic formulation for reservoir simulators. The general idea, depicted in Figure 2–12, shows a simpliﬁed onedimensional (1-D) grid. As injected water displaces.

The Buckley-Leverett theory is deﬁcient in one major respect—accounting for capillary pressure.

# Myth = Mithya: Decoding Hindu Mythology (DR. DEVDUTT PATTANAIK)

People outgrow myth and mythology when myth and mythology fail to respond to their cultural needs.

The difference between God and god is that the latter fears death and jealously guards Amrita, the nectar of immortality. God has no such fear. God never dies, for God was never born. Every time God blinks a god dies. Every time a god blinks a human dies. This idea of relativity between humans, gods and God is captured in the following narrative. It shows that only God can expand and contract time and space.

Shiva represents the hermit’s way of life;Vishnu represents the householder’s way of life. In the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, Hindu society was able to resolve its own conflict: to celebrate worldly life or renounce its fettering enchantments.

Brahma creates,Vishnu sustains, Shiva destroys, while Saraswati, Lakshmi and Shakti embody knowledge, wealth and power respectively.

Brahma creates,Vishnu sustains, Shiva destroys, while Saraswati, Lakshmi and Shakti embody knowledge, wealth and power respectively. The male forms of the divine are associated with verbs—creating, sustaining and destroying—while the female forms of the divine are associated with nouns: knowledge, wealth, power. Gods do; Goddesses are. Gods are active; Goddesses passive. Goddesses may be knowledge, wealth and power but it is Gods who are knowledgeable, wealthy and powerful. Thus the male form of divinity represents the subject—he who is sensitive to life and he who responds to life. The female form of divinity represents the object—she who is life.

The split portion of the Purusha is identified as Prakriti. The two complement each other. In common parlance, Purusha is translated to mean ‘man’ while Prakriti means ‘nature’. Thus Purusha can also mean ‘culture’ while Prakriti can also mean ‘woman’. These translations suggest that in the Hindu world man is equal to culture and woman to nature. Such an interpretation reinforces the popular belief that the Hindu world is patriarchal, with men deciding how the world should be.

Rishis realized that just as Purusha could not be explained without comparing and contrasting it with Prakriti, the northern direction could not be explained without referring to the southern direction, the right side could not be explained without the left side and man could not be explained without woman. Following this realization, the north, the right side and all things masculine came to represent Purusha while the south, the left side and all things feminine came to represent Prakriti.

Spurred by the ego, Brahma seeks to possess the Goddess, control her. She takes many forms, as is her nature, and slips away like water from a clenched palm. To keep up with her, Brahma changes his forms. When she becomes a goose, he becomes a gander. When she becomes a cow, he becomes a bull. In effect, Brahma loses his own identity and acquires an identity that depends on the outside world.

To keep up with her, Brahma changes his forms. When she becomes a goose, he becomes a gander. When she becomes a cow, he becomes a bull. In effect, Brahma loses his own identity and acquires an identity that depends on the outside world. As the chase proceeds, Brahma forgets the reason he created the world in the first place. The objective of self-realization gives way to the quest for self-preservation, self-propagation and self-actualization.

Had Dasharatha not been cursed, had Kaikeyi not misused her boons, Rama would never have gone into the forest and Ravana would never have been killed. The effects of curses and boons telescope into each other, weaving the plots of a narrative.

Unlike Brahma, who treats the Asuras and the Devas equally, Vishnu clearly sides with the Devas. This favouritism ensures that the wealth that emerges from the ocean of milk stays above the earth, enriching human society. Vishnu is thus a worldly form of God, patron of culture, the lord of Lakshmi.

Rama behaves like Ravana here. He distracts Vali with Sugriva’s challenge just as Ravana distracted him with the golden deer. He kills Vali through an act of trickery that is acceptable in the jungle but not in civilized society. In other words, Rama uses the law of the jungle against the very people who follow it. Vali accuses Rama of being a cheat but Rama refuses to feel guilty: those who live by the law of the jungle must be ready to die by the law of the jungle.

Life begins with a naming ceremony, followed by the rituals of shaving the hair, piercing the ear, giving the child solid food, teaching the child to read and write, getting the child educated, then married. Marriage is followed by the birth of the next generation. When the new generation comes, the old generation dies. Funeral rites involve the promise to produce children, for through children the forefathers are reborn. This predictability is the hallmark of the perfect society. Rama’s kingdom was said to be such a kingdom. The rains always came on time. There were no diseases or accidents. No surprises.

‘If I have thought of no man but Rama as my husband, let the earth split and consume me.’.

Without Sita, Rama could not bear to live on earth. He entered the river Sarayu and did not rise again.

Civilized behaviour, however cruel it may be. Rama suffers greatly because he has to choose between the dharma of a king and the dharma of a husband. As king, he must respect his people’s wishes. As husband, he can never be unfaithful to his wife. In the struggle to balance the two roles, Rama’s personal life takes a toll. Rama’s poise and dignity in the face of such pressure and tragedy make him, in the eyes of Hindus, the supreme upholder of social values, maryada purushottam.

Knowledge is a faithful wife. Saraswati is difficult to acquire, but once she comes into a person’s life she never leaves. Wealth, on the other hand, is a demanding wife. Lakshmi comes and goes as she pleases and one must constantly strive to keep her coming. Knowledge does not outlive death. Wealth does.

Lakshmi comes and goes as she pleases and one must constantly strive to keep her coming. Knowledge does not outlive death. Wealth does. Distribution of knowledge only enhances it. Distribution of wealth depletes it. The difference between Saraswati and Lakshmi is apparent in their respective symbols.

Lakshmi has two forms: Bhoodevi and Shridevi. The former is the goddess of earth, the latter the goddess of heaven. The former is associated with fertility, the latter with glory and power. The former bestows tangible wealth in the form of gold and grain. The latter bestows intangible wealth: power, fame and.

Krishna is witness to a crisis between model social codes and unreasonable aspirations of the people. Krishna acknowledges, suffers and resolves this conflict between head and heart with compassion and love. Surrounded by social turbulence, he remains calm and composed, with an endearing look in his eyes and a smile on his lips. This makes him poorna-avatar, the complete and most perfect incarnation of God.

A comparison of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata shows that, though both seek to establish order in the world, they are clearly responses to different needs. The Ramayana is about compliance; the Mahabharata is about revolution. Rama strives to keep old rules; Krishna struggles to make new rules. Rama’s approach, unfortunately, allows for the exile of Sita. Krishna’s approach is marked by a furious bloodbath, where all rules of civilized warfare are disregarded.

What is dharma for Rama can never be dharma for Krishna because Rama and Krishna belong to different points in time. Rama resides in an earlier, purer age and Krishna in a later, darker age. As the Manu Smriti states, rules and regulations need to change with time and space; they need to respond to history and adapt to geography.

Daksha gave twenty-seven of his daughters in marriage to Chandra, the moon-god, who was renowned for his beauty and virility. Chandra preferred the beautiful Rohini to the others. The neglected wives complained to Daksha, who threatened Chandra with dire consequences if he did not treat all his wives with equal affection, as is expected of any polygamous man. Chandra disregarded Daksha’s threat. So he was cursed with a degenerative disease. As the days passed, he lost his potency, and began to wane. A terrified Chandra went to Shiva, who let Chandra sit on his head. There, Chandra found the power to regenerate himself: his potency returned and he began to wax. A sobered Chandra decided to devote at least one night to each of his twenty-seven wives. And so it is that the moon waxes on the days he approaches Rohini and wanes on the days he moves farther from her.

On the day before, when he is just a crescent, the moon celebrates Shiva-ratri, the night of Shiva, and takes refuge on Shiva’s locks, safe in the knowledge that he will wax once more. (Somanath Sthala Purana).

Where he is worshipped, he has two wives. In shrines, Ganesha is always associated with Lakshmi and Saraswati. Some say these are his sisters. Some say these are his wives, forms of Riddhi and Siddhi. Once again, it is association with Goddesses that makes.

Perhaps our world is the mirror of our soul. It is the source and destination of all our memories, our desires, our ideas, our feelings, our thoughts, our values and our judgements. It exists because we are aware of it. We know we exist because we are aware of it. Our world cannot exist without us. We cannot exist without our world. Without either there is neither. We are inextricably bound to each other. Our life is a life-long affair with our world that will end when we die. All meaning that we seek has to lie somewhere beween us and our world. There is no one else between the two of us.

Inside are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, creating, sustaining and destroying. Outside are Saraswati, Lakshmi and Shakti, enlightening, enriching and empowering. Around us are the goddesses. Within are the gods.


# A Man Called Ove: A Novel (Fredrik Backman)

While his proper cup of coffee was brewing, he put on his navy blue trousers and jacket, stepped into his wooden clogs, and shoved his hands in his pockets in that particular way of a middle-aged man who expects the worthless world outside to disappoint him.

Makes. Just like that. Whenever they feel like it. Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at.

Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at all. Ove couldn’t give a damn about people jogging. What he can’t understand is why they have to make such a big thing of it. With those smug smiles on their faces, as if they were out there curing pulmonary emphysema. Either they walk fast or they run slowly, that’s what joggers do. It’s a forty-year-old man’s way of telling the world that he can’t do anything right. Is it really necessary to dress up as a fourteen-year-old Romanian gymnast in order to be able to do it? Or the Olympic tobogganing team? Just because one shuffles aimlessly around the block for three quarters of an hour?.

Ove’s forehead compresses itself into one large, threatening wrinkle.

“Reverse radar and parking sensors and cameras and crap like that. A man who needs all that to back up with a trailer shouldn’t be bloody doing it in the first place.”.

What all these people were doing at the shopping center on a normal weekday was beyond his comprehension. Obviously people no longer had jobs to go to.

Ove’s wife sometimes jokes that the three worst words Ove knows in this life are “Batteries not included.” People usually laugh when she says that. But Ove does not usually laugh.

Ove’s wife often quarrels with Ove because he’s always arguing about everything. But Ove isn’t bloody arguing. He just thinks right is right. Is that such an unreasonable attitude to life?.

It’s been six months since she died. But Ove still inspects the whole house twice a day to feel the radiators and check that she hasn’t sneakily turned up the heating.

Her friends couldn’t see why she woke up every morning and voluntarily decided to share the whole day with him. He couldn’t either. He built her a bookshelf and she filled it with books by people who wrote page after page about their feelings. Ove understood things he could see and touch. Wood and concrete. Glass and steel. Tools. Things one could figure out. He understood right angles and clear instruction manuals. Assembly models and drawings. Things one could draw on paper. He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.

You are what you are and you do what you do, and that was good enough for Ove.

Then Mum died. And Dad grew even quieter. As if she took away with her the few words he’d possessed.

They never had much, but they always had enough.

“We’re not the sort of people who tell tales about what others do,”.

Had Ove been the sort of man who contemplated how and when one became the sort of man one was, he might have said this was the day he learned that right has to be right. But he wasn’t one to dwell on things like that. He contented himself with remembering that on this day he’d decided to be as little unlike his father as possible.

“Christ, you bloody cat, me backing you up when that stupid bag threw stones at you only means I dislike you less than that weedy nutter across the street. And that’s not much of an achievement; you should be absolutely clear about that.”.

You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.

Ove goes to get his box of drill bits. These are single-handedly the most important things when drilling. Not the drill, but the bits. It’s like having proper tires on your car instead of messing about with ceramic brakes and nonsense like that. Anyone who knows anything knows that.

They remind him of two malfunctioning radiators, making high-pitched whines at each other.

“And why exactly are you here?” “Moral support,” she twitters.

“Maybe this could have been thought about before you organized a coup d’état in the Residents’ Association,”.

He sinks down on the stool, breathing heavily. His hands are still shaking as if he were standing waist-deep in ice-cold water. His chest thumps. It happens more and more these days. He has to sort of struggle for a mouthful of air, like a fish in an overturned bowl. His company doctor said it was chronic, and that he mustn’t work himself up. Easy for him to say.

Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his.

Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his. She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside. And he always felt that nothing in the world was impossible when she did that. Of all the things he could miss, that’s what he misses most.

She believed in destiny. That all the roads you walk in life, in one way or another, “lead to what has been predetermined for you.”.

But he never disagreed with her. Maybe to her destiny was “something”; that was none of his business. But to him, destiny was “someone.”.

“If you really had to take both Mum and Dad, keep your bloody money!” he yelled up at the ceiling.

Ove didn’t turn around. But his back was straighter as he walked off.

Since his father’s death he had begun more and more to differentiate between people who did what they should, and those who didn’t.

People who did and people who just talked.

People who did and people who just talked. Ove talked less and less and did more and more.

Ove. His colleagues learned to appreciate him for it. “When people don’t talk so much they don’t dish out the crap either,”.

“I’m not the sort that tells tales about what other people do,”.

Ove walked out into the morning air without turning around. He took a deep breath. He was furious, but not because they had called him a thief. He would never be the sort of man who cared what other men called him. But the shame of losing a job to which his father had devoted his whole life burned like a red-hot poker in his breast.

“Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say,”.

She often said that “all roads lead to something you were always predestined to do.” And for her, perhaps, it was something. But for Ove it was someone.

“How the heck are you supposed to have a reasonable conversation with someone who buys a BMW?”.

He felt one should not go through life as if everything was exchangeable. As if loyalty was worthless.

He felt one should not go through life as if everything was exchangeable. As if loyalty was worthless. Nowadays people changed their stuff so often that any expertise in how to make things last was becoming superfluous. Quality: no one cared about that anymore.

“If I happen to look the other way and something you need goes walking, I’ll assume you’ve burned it,”.

Holding a blunt silver dinner knife in one hand. And he realizes.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You work and pay off the mortgage and pay taxes and do what you should. You marry. For better or for worse until death do us part, wasn’t that what they agreed?.

And she wasn’t supposed to be the first one to die. Wasn’t it bloody well understood that it was his death they were talking about? Well, wasn’t it?.

“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away,”.

He knew very well that some people thought he was nothing but a grumpy old sod without any faith in people. But, to put it bluntly, that was because people had.

He knew very well that some people thought he was nothing but a grumpy old sod without any faith in people.

Because a time comes in every man’s life when he decides what sort of man he’s going to be: the kind who lets other people walk all over him, or not.

A time comes in every man’s life when he decides what sort of man he is are going to be. Whether he is the kind who lets other people tread on him, or not.

A time like that comes for every man, when he chooses what sort of man he wants to be. And if you don’t know the story, you don’t know the man.

She liked talking and Ove liked keeping quiet. Retrospectively, Ove assumed that was what people meant when they said that people were compatible.

Ove did the same thing every day for three months. In the end she grew tired of his never inviting her out for dinner. So she invited herself instead.

“I’ll be waiting here tomorrow evening at eight o’clock. I want you to be wearing a suit and I’d like you to invite me out for dinner,” she said succinctly as she stepped off the train one Friday evening. And so it was.

Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.

And when she did finally turn up, in a long floral-print skirt and a cardigan so red that it made Ove shift his weight from his right foot to his left, he decided that maybe her inability to be on time was not the most important thing.

And now she stood outside the station with his flowers pressed happily to her breast, in that red cardigan of hers, making the rest of the world look as if it were made in grayscale.

She told him with great animation about her studies, about books she’d read or films she’d seen. And when she looked at Ove she made him feel, for the first time, that he was the only man in the world.

But if anyone had asked, he would have told them that he never lived before he met her. And not after either.

Because this time neither Pregnant Foreign Woman, Blond Weed, Rune’s wife, nor low-quality rope would be given any opportunity of ruining Ove’s morning.

Before that day when the dour and slightly fumbling boy with the muscular body and the sad blue eyes sat down beside Sonja on the train, there were really only three things she loved unconditionally in her life: books, her father, and cats.

“They say the best men are born out of their faults and that they often improve later on, more than if they’d never done anything wrong,” she’d said gently.

In their almost four decades together Sonja taught hundreds of pupils with learning difficulties to read and write, and she got them to read Shakespeare’s collected works. In the same period she never managed to make Ove read a single Shakespeare play. But as soon as they moved into their row house he spent every evening for weeks on end in the toolshed. And when he was done, the most beautiful bookcases she had ever seen were in their living room.

And when one of her girlfriends asked why she loved him she answered that most men ran away from an inferno. But men like Ove ran into.

And when one of her girlfriends asked why she loved him she answered that most men ran away from an inferno. But men like Ove ran into it.

The ones she liked, such as The Old Man and the.

The ones she liked, such as The Old Man and the Sea, she’d read so many times that she’d lost count.

As if he were a big mound of ice cream that had first melted and then been refrozen.

When Sonja came out of the waiting room she rested her forehead heavily against Ove’s broad chest. “I feel so much loss, Ove. Loss, as if my heart was beating outside my body.” They stood in silence for a long time, with their arms around each other. And at long last she lifted her face towards his, and looked into his eyes with great seriousness. “You have to love me twice as much now,” she said. And then Ove lied to her for the second—and last—time: he said that he would. Even though he knew it wasn’t possible for him to love her any more than he already did.

“I’ve brought some flowers with me,” he mumbles. “Pink. Which you like. They say they die in the frost but they only tell you that to trick you into buying the more expensive ones.”.

For almost twenty minutes, Ove sits in the driver’s seat of the Saab with the garage door open. For the first five minutes the cat stares at him impatiently from the passenger seat. During the next five it begins to look properly worried. In the end it tries to open the door itself; when this fails, it promptly lies down on the seat and goes to sleep.

She also ate bananas in such quantities that the people at the supermarket must have thought Ove had started a zoo.

When a person gives to another person it’s not just the receiver who’s blessed. It’s the giver.

“We can busy ourselves with living or with dying, Ove. We have to move on.”.

Every human being needs to know what she’s fighting for. That was what they said. And she fought for what was good. For the children she never had. And Ove fought for her.

“You’re the funniest thing she knows. That’s why she always draws you in color,” says Parvaneh.

He thinks about how it would feel, doing it this way. He has never taken any narcotics. Has hardly even been affected by alcohol. Has never liked the feeling of losing control.

Ove is concerned only a complete bloody airhead could find loss of control a state worth aiming for.

But it’s actually wrong, all this. She married him. And now he doesn’t quite know how to carry on without the tip of her nose in the pit between his throat and his shoulder. That’s all.

The car was just “a means of transport” and the.

The car was just “a means of transport” and the road just a complication arising between two points.

Then she looks at Ove and smiles ingratiatingly.

You release the clutch slowly until you find the point where it engages, then give it a bit of gas, release the clutch, and move off.”.

“You’ve given birth to two children and quite soon you’ll be squeezing out a third. You’ve come here from a land far away and most likely you fled war and persecution and all sorts of other nonsense. You’ve learned a new language and got yourself an education and you’re holding together a family of obvious incompetents. And I’ll be damned if I’ve seen you afraid of a single bloody thing in this world before now.”.

Ove shifts his weight from his left foot to his right and peers around the premises.

It was as if he didn’t want other people to talk to him, he was afraid that their chattering voices would drown out the memory of her voice.

“Other wives get annoyed because their husbands don’t notice when they have their hair cut. When I have a haircut my husband is annoyed with me for days because I don’t look the same,” Sonja used to say.

People need a function, he believes. And he has always been functional, no one can take that away from him.

“God took a child from me, darling Ove. But he gave me a thousand others.”.

The next morning, after letting the cat out, he fetched Sonja’s father’s old rifle from the attic. He’d decided that his dislike of weapons could never be greater than his dislike of all the empty places she has left behind in their silent little house. It was time now.

Ove was a man of the same ilk.

A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals,.

A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals, so you always had something to tinker with. “All people want to live dignified.

A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals, so you always had something to tinker with.

“All people want to live dignified lives; dignity just means something different to different people,”.

Ove has probably known all along what he has to do, but all people at root are time optimists. We always think there’s enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like “if.”.

The gravestone stays where it is without saying anything, but Ove doesn’t need words to know what she would have thought. The silent approach has always been her preferred trick when there are disputes with him. Whether she’s alive or dead.

Nonvehicular predicament.

She adds, with a smile: “The great thing about scrutinizing bureaucracy when you’re a journalist, you see, is that the first people to break the laws of bureaucracy are always the bureaucrats themselves.”.

“Loving someone is like moving into a house,” Sonja used to say. “At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it’s cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.”.

It is difficult to admit that one is wrong. Particularly when one has been wrong for a very long time.

Broadly speaking there are two kinds of people. Those who understand how extremely useful white cables can be, and those who don’t.

A few minutes later Ove snatches the plastic bag with the iPad box from the counter, mumbling something about “eightthousandtwohundredandninetyfivekronor and they don’t even throw in a keyboard!” followed by “thieves,” “bandits,” and various obscenities.

Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it’s often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.

And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for.

And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps. Afternoons in the sun with someone’s hand clutched in one’s own. The fragrance of flowerbeds in fresh bloom. Sundays in a café. Grandchildren, perhaps. One finds a way of living for the sake of someone else’s future. And it wasn’t as if Ove also died when Sonja left him. He just stopped living. Grief is a strange thing.

“Oh, don’t concern yourself about that. Ove is quite clearly UTTERLY LOUSY at dying!”.

“Sometimes it can be quite nice having something to get on with in the daytime.”.

She teaches him to insert smileys into a text message, and he makes her promise never to tell Patrick that he’s got himself a cell phone.

He woke up at quarter to six and that was when he got up.

Ove is the sort of man who checks the status of all things by giving them a good kick.

He accentuated the net even though his wife nagged that you had to put the emphasis on Inter.

No one does that anymore, no one takes responsibility.

A country full of people who just want to have lunch all day.

Because nowadays people are all thirty-one and wear too-tight trousers and no longer drink normal coffee.

Because nowadays people are all thirty-one and wear too-tight trousers and no longer drink normal coffee. And don’t want to take responsibility. A shed-load of men with elaborate beards, changing jobs and changing wives and changing their car makes. Just like that. Whenever they feel like it.

All the things Ove’s wife has bought are “lovely”.

All the things Ove’s wife has bought are “lovely” or “homey.” Everything Ove buys is useful.

People don’t have useful things anymore. People just have shit.

People have no respect for decent, honest functionality anymore, they’re happy as long as everything looks neat and dandy on the computer.

People have no respect for decent, honest functionality anymore, they’re happy as long as everything looks neat and dandy on the computer. But Ove does things the way they’re supposed to be done.

What did they know about waking up on a Tuesday and no longer having a purpose?.

Ove feels an instinctive skepticism towards all people taller than six feet; the blood can’t quite make it all the way up to the brain.

Ove doubts whether someone who can’t park a car properly should even be allowed to vote.

Him. “You shouldn’t even be allowed to rewind a cassette,”.

“You shouldn’t even be allowed to rewind a cassette,”.

And they have the biggest brown eyes Ove has ever seen.

He can’t understand people who long to retire. How can anyone spend their whole life longing for the day when they become superfluous? Wandering about, a burden on society, what sort of man would ever wish for that? Staying at home, waiting to die. Or even worse: waiting for them to come and fetch you and put you in a home. Being dependent on other people to get to the toilet. Ove can’t think of anything worse. His wife often teases him, says he’s the only man she knows who’d rather be laid out in a coffin than travel in a mobility service van. And she may have a point there.

“If there’s one thing you could write in Ove’s obituary, it’s ‘At least he was economical with gas.’”.

He knew these retailers were always trying to screw you out of money, and no one screwed Ove and got away with.

He knew these retailers were always trying to screw you out of money, and no one screwed Ove and got away with it.

People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn’t overly keen on people.

People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right. He’d never reflected much on it. People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn’t overly keen on people. And in this instance he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds.

Her friends couldn’t see why she woke up every morning and voluntarily decided to share the whole day with him.

He built her a bookshelf and she filled it with books by people who wrote page after page about their feelings.

Ove understood things he could see and touch. Wood and concrete. Glass and steel. Tools. Things one could figure out. He understood right angles and clear instruction manuals. Assembly models and drawings. Things one could draw on paper. He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.

“Ove, only a swine thinks size and strength are the same thing. Remember that.”.

With a pat on his shoulder, the director returned to the office. Ove’s father stayed where he was in the courtyard, trying to catch his breath. That evening he had to explain everything over and over again to his goggle-eyed son and show all there was to know about this magical monster now parked in their garden. He sat in the driver’s seat half the night, with the boy on his lap, explaining how all the mechanical parts were connected. He could account for every screw, every little tube. Ove had never seen a man as proud as his father was that night. He was eight years old and decided that night he would never drive any car but a Saab.

“It’s an honest job and that’s worth something.”.

Not because Ove did not believe in God, he explained to the vicar, but because in his view this God seemed to be a bit of a bloody swine.

Satisfied, then walks through the living room, swinging.

Consume electricity. Out of the question.”.

Not that Ove dislikes fat people. Certainly not. People can look any way they like. He has just never been able to understand them, can’t fathom how they do it. How much can one person eat? How does one manage to turn oneself into a twin-size person? It must take a certain determination, he reflects.


# Marketing Management (Philip Kotler, Kevin Lane Keller)

Sights on developing and emerging (D&E) markets,.

Good marketing is no accident. It is both an art and a science, and it results from careful planning and execution using state-of-the-art tools and techniques.

Marketing is about identifying and meeting human and social needs. One of the shortest good definitions of marketing is “meeting needs profitably.”.

These two firms demonstrated marketing savvy and turned a private or social need into a profitable business opportunity.

Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

Marketing management as the art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing customers through creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value.

A social definition shows the role marketing plays in society; for example, one marketer has said that marketing’s role is to “deliver a higher standard of living.”.

Marketing is a societal process by which individuals and groups obtain what they need and want through creating, offering, and freely exchanging products and services of value with others.

There will always, one can assume, be need for some selling. But the aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself. Ideally, marketing should result in a customer who is ready to buy. All that should be needed then is to make the product or service available.

Marketers market 10 main types of entities: goods, services, events, experiences, persons, places, properties, organizations, information, and ideas.

“In the factory we make cosmetics; in the drugstore we sell hope.” Products and services are platforms for delivering some idea or benefit. Social marketers promote such ideas as “Friends Don’t Let Friends Drive Drunk” and “A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste.”.

A marketer is someone who seeks a response—attention, a purchase, a vote, a donation—from another party,.

A marketer is someone who seeks a response—attention, a purchase, a vote, a donation—from another party, called the prospect.

KEY CUSTOMER MARKETS Consider the following key customer markets: consumer, business, global, and nonprofit.

Needs are the basic human requirements such as for air, food, water, clothing, and shelter. Humans also have strong needs for recreation, education, and entertainment. These needs become wants when directed to specific objects that might satisfy the need. A U.S. consumer needs food but may want a Chicago-style “deep-dish” pizza and a craft beer. A person in Afghanistan needs food but may want rice, lamb, and carrots. Our wants are shaped by our society.

Demands are wants for specific products backed by an ability to pay.

Companies must measure not only how many people want their product, but also how many are willing and able to buy it.

Marketers might promote the idea that a Mercedes satisfies a person’s need for social status. They do not, however, create the need for social status.

Volvo develops its cars for the buyer to whom safety is a major concern, positioning them as the safest a customer can buy.

Porsche targets buyers who seek pleasure and excitement in driving and want to make a statement about their wheels.

Companies address customer needs by putting forth a value proposition, a set of benefits that satisfy those needs. The intangible value proposition is made physical by an offering, which can be a combination of products, services, information, and experiences.

Brand is an offering from a known source.

A brand is an offering from a known source.

Communication channels deliver and receive messages from target buyers and include newspapers, magazines, radio, television, mail, telephone, smart phone, billboards, posters, fliers, CDs, audiotapes, and the Internet.

Distribution channels help display, sell, or deliver the physical product or service(s) to the buyer or user.

Distribution channels help display, sell, or deliver the physical product or service(s) to the buyer or user. These channels may be direct via the Internet, mail, or mobile phone or telephone or indirect with distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and agents as intermediaries.

Service channels that include warehouses, transportation companies, banks, and insurance companies. Marketers clearly face a design challenge in choosing the best mix of communication, distribution, and service channels for their offerings.

Paid media include TV, magazine and display ads, paid search, and sponsorships, all of which allow marketers to show their ad or brand for a fee.

Owned media are communication channels marketers actually own, like a company or brand brochure, Web site, blog, Facebook page, or Twitter account.

Earned media are streams in which consumers, the press, or other outsiders voluntarily communicate something about the brand via word of mouth, buzz, or viral marketing methods.

Value, a central marketing concept, is primarily a combination of quality, service, and price (qsp), called the customer value triad.

We can think of marketing as the identification, creation, communication, delivery, and monitoring of customer value.

Performance falls short of expectations, the customer is disappointed. If it matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. If it exceeds them, the customer is delighted.

If performance falls short of expectations, the customer is disappointed. If it matches expectations, the customer is satisfied. If it exceeds them, the customer is delighted.

The supply chain is a channel stretching from raw materials to components to finished products carried to final buyers.

The marketing environment consists of the task environment and the broad environment. The task environment includes the actors engaged in producing, distributing, and promoting the offering. These are the company, suppliers, distributors, dealers, and target customers.

The broad environment consists of six components: demographic environment, economic environment, social- cultural environment, natural environment, technological environment, and political-legal environment.

Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool that lets users collect and share images of projects or products on digital scrapbooks or “pinboards.”.

The old credo “information is power” is giving way to the new idea that “sharing information is power.”.

Though the company had a sophisticated customer relationship management (CRM) software system before, it still depended on sales reps to accurately input data in a timely fashion, which unfortunately did not always happen.

In terms of growth of the middle class, defined as earning more than $3,000 per year, the Philippines, China, and Peru are the three fastest-growing countries.32.

Successful marketing is thus distinguished by its human or emotional element. A third wave of thinking, values-driven and heralded as “Marketing 3.0,” has moved us beyond the productcentric and consumer- centric models of the past, these authors say. Its three central trends are increased consumer participation and collaborative marketing, globalization, and and the rise of a creative society.

These authors believe the future of marketing will be horizontal: consumer-to-consumer. They feel the recent economic downturn has not fostered trust in the marketplace and that customers now increasingly turn to one another for credible advice and information when selecting products.

India’s Hindustan Unilever asks all staff members—not just marketers—to obtain a “consumer license” to work on its brands, which requires spending 50 hours of face time with shoppers. As one senior executive noted, “Our consumers are moving faster than marketers do; whether in terms of rural or urban changes or the way they consume media and entertainment.”54.

These communications focus on the core themes of “happiness” and “optimism” that define the brand’s positioning.

Coca-Cola actively experiments, allocating 70 percent of its budget to activities it knows will work, 20 percent to improving those activities, and 10 percent to experimentation.

For instance, Coca-Cola places much importance on cultural leadership and causes that benefit others.

They are thus applying more metrics—brand equity, customer lifetime value, return on marketing investment (ROMI)—to understand and measure their marketing and business performance and a broader variety of financial measures to assess the direct and indirect value their marketing efforts create.

“Marketing is far too important to leave to the marketing department.”.

Increasingly, marketing is not done only by the marketing department; every employee has an impact on the customer.

Marketers now must properly manage all possible touch points: store layouts, package designs, product functions, employee training, and shipping and logistics. To create a strong marketing organization, marketers must think like executives in other departments, and executives in other departments must think more like marketers. Interdepartmental teamwork that includes marketers is needed to manage key processes like production innovation, new-business development, customer acquisition and retention, and order fulfillment.

The production concept is one of the oldest concepts in business. It holds that consumers prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive. Managers of production-oriented businesses concentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution.

Marketers also use the production concept when they want to expand the market.

The product concept proposes that consumers favor products offering the most quality, performance, or innovative features. However, managers are sometimes caught in a love affair with their products. They might commit the “bettermousetrap” fallacy, believing a better product will by itself lead people to beat a path to their door. As many start-ups have learned the hard way, a new or improved product will not necessarily be successful unless it’s priced, distributed, advertised, and sold properly.

The selling concept holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, won’t buy enough of the organization’s products. It is practiced most aggressively with unsought goods—goods buyers don’t normally think of buying such as insurance and cemetery plots—and when firms with overcapacity aim to sell what they make, rather than make what the market wants. Marketing based on hard selling is risky. It assumes customers coaxed into buying a product not only won’t return or bad-mouth it or complain to consumer organizations but might even buy it again.

The marketing concept emerged in the mid-1950s as a customer-centered, sense-and-respond philosophy. The job is to find not the right customers for your products, but the right products for your customers. Dell doesn’t prepare a PC or laptop for its target market. Rather, it provides product platforms on which each person customizes the features he or she desires in the machine.

Selling focuses on the needs of the seller; marketing on the needs of the buyer.

Selling focuses on the needs of the seller; marketing on the needs of the buyer. Selling is preoccupied with the seller’s need to convert his product into cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the product and the whole cluster of things associated with creating, delivering, and finally consuming it.

The holistic marketing concept is based on the development, design, and implementation of marketing programs, processes, and activities that recognize their breadth and interdependencies.

The operating principle is simple: build an effective network of relationships with key stakeholders, and profits will follow.

Thus more companies are choosing to own brands rather than physical assets, and they are subcontracting activities to firms that can do them better and more cheaply while retaining core activities at home.

“IBM is not a technology company but a company solving problems using technology.”.

Integrated marketing occurs when the marketer devises marketing activities and assembles marketing programs to create, communicate, and deliver value for consumers such that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”.

(1) many different marketing activities can create, communicate, and deliver value and (2) marketers should design and implement any one marketing activity with all other activities in mind.

Smart marketers recognize that marketing activities within the company can be as important—or even more important—than those directed outside the company. It makes no sense to promise excellent service before the company’s staff is ready to provide it.

The marketing vice president of a major European airline wants to increase the airline’s traffic share. His strategy is to build up customer satisfaction by providing better food, cleaner cabins, better-trained cabin crews, and lower fares, yet he has no authority in these matters. The catering department chooses food that keeps food costs down; the maintenance department uses inexpensive cleaning services; the human resources department hires people without regard to whether they are naturally friendly; the finance department sets the fares. Because these departments generally take a cost or production point of view, the vice president of marketing is stymied in his efforts to create an integrated marketing program.

Performance marketing requires understanding the financial and nonfinancial returns to business and society from marketing activities and programs. As noted previously, top marketers are increasingly going beyond sales revenue to examine the marketing scorecard and interpret what is happening to market share, customer loss rate, customer satisfaction, product quality, and other measures. They are also considering the legal, ethical, social, and environmental effects of marketing activities and programs.

Which he called the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.61.

Marketers set the product (which mainly influences acceptability), the price (which mainly influences affordability), the place (which mainly influences accessibility), and promotion (which mainly influences awareness).

(The “Marketing Memo: Marketers’ Frequently Asked Questions” is a good checklist for the questions marketing managers ask, all of which we examine in this book.).

Marketing is an organizational function and a set of processes for creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its stakeholders. Marketing management is the art and science of choosing target markets and getting, keeping, and growing customers through creating, delivering, and communicating superior customer value.

Marketers are skilled at managing demand: They seek to influence its level, timing, and composition for goods, services, events, experiences, persons, places, properties, organizations, information, and ideas. They also operate in four different marketplaces: consumer, business, global, and nonprofit.

The holistic marketing concept is based on the development, design, and implementation of marketing programs, processes, and activities that recognize their breadth and interdependencies. Holistic marketing recognizes that everything matters in marketing and that a broad, integrated perspective is often necessary. Four components of holistic marketing are relationship marketing, integrated marketing, internal marketing, and performance marketing. The set of tasks necessary for successful marketing.

In economies with many different types of people, each with individual wants, perceptions, preferences, and buying criteria, the smart competitor must design and deliver offerings for well-defined target markets. This realization inspired a new view of business processes that places marketing at the beginning of planning. Instead of emphasizing making and selling, companies now see themselves as part of a value delivery process.

First, choosing the value is the “homework” marketers must do before any product exists.

They must segment the market, select the appropriate target, and develop the offering’s value positioning.

They must segment the market, select the appropriate target, and develop the offering’s value positioning. The formula “segmentation, targeting, positioning (STP)” is the essence of strategic marketing.

The second phase is providing the value. Marketing must identify specific product features, prices, and distribution. The task in the third phase is communicating the value by utilizing the Internet, advertising, sales force, and any other communication tools to announce and promote the product. The value delivery process begins before there is a product and continues through development and after launch. Each phase has cost implications.

The firm’s success depends not only on how well each department performs its work, but also on how well the company coordinates departmental activities to conduct core business processes.

Further, a strong yen and high manufacturing costs in Japan made it difficult for Panasonic to compete on price.

(1) corporate, (2) division, (3) business unit, and (4) product.

Corporate headquarters is responsible for designing a corporate strategic plan to guide the whole enterprise; it makes decisions on the amount of resources to allocate to each division as well as on which businesses to start or eliminate. Each division establishes a plan covering the allocation of funds to each business unit within the division. Each business unit develops a strategic plan to carry that business unit into a profitable future. Finally, each product level (product line, brand) develops a marketing plan for achieving its objectives.

The marketing plan is the central instrument for directing and coordinating the marketing effort. It operates at two levels: strategic and tactical. The strategic marketing plan lays out the target markets and the firm’s value proposition, based on an analysis of the best market opportunities. The tactical marketing plan specifies the marketing tactics, including product features, promotion, merchandising, pricing, sales channels, and service.

What is our business? Who is the customer? What is of value to the customer? What will our business be? What should our business be? These simple-sounding questions are among the most difficult a company will ever face. Successful companies continuously ask and answer them.

Market definitions of a business, however, describe the business as a customer satisfying process.

Products are transient; basic needs and customer groups endure forever.

Products are transient; basic needs and customer groups endure forever. Transportation is a need: the horse and carriage, automobile, railroad, airline, ship, and truck are products that meet that need.

What exactly is a corporate culture? Some define it as “the shared experiences, stories, beliefs, and norms that characterize an organization.”.

A company’s organization consists of its structures, policies, and corporate culture, all of which can become dysfunctional in a rapidly changing business environment. Whereas managers can change structures and policies (though with difficulty), the company’s culture is very hard to change.

What exactly is a corporate culture? Some define it as “the shared experiences, stories, beliefs, and norms that characterize an organization.” Walk into any company and the first thing that strikes you.

Senior management should identify and encourage fresh ideas from three generally underrepresented groups: employees with youthful or diverse perspectives, employees far removed from company headquarters, and employees new to the industry. Each group can challenge company orthodoxy and stimulate new ideas.

The Royal Dutch/Shell Group has pioneered scenario analysis, which develops plausible representations of a firm’s possible future using assumptions about forces driving the market and different uncertainties. Managers think through each scenario with the question, “What will we do if it happens?,” adopt one scenario as the most probable, and watch for signposts that might confirm or disconfirm it.

Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, says IDEO asks “how might we” with each design challenge. “The ‘How’ part assumes there are solutions out there—it provides creative confidence,” Brown said. “The ‘Might’ part says we can put ideas out there that might work or might not—either way, it’s OK. And the ‘We’ part says we’re going to do it together and build on each other’s ideas.”.

Companies like Facebook and Google kickstart the creative problem- solving process by using the phrase, “How might we?” Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, says IDEO asks “how might we” with each design challenge. “The ‘How’ part assumes there are solutions out there—it provides creative confidence,” Brown said. “The ‘Might’ part says we can put ideas out there that might work or might not—either way, it’s OK. And the ‘We’ part says we’re going to do it together and build on each other’s ideas.”.

The overall evaluation of a company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats is called SWOT analysis. It’s a way of monitoring the external and internal marketing environment.

A marketing plan is a written document that summarizes what the marketer has learned about the marketplace and indicates how the firm plans to reach its marketing objectives.

The vision of the Electrolux Group is to become the best appliance company in the world as measured by its customers, employees, and shareholders.

It bases its strategy on four pillars: innovative products, operational excellence, profitable growth, and dedicated employees.

“The real price of anything is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.”.

Total customer cost therefore also includes the buyer’s time, energy, and psychological costs expended in product acquisition, usage, maintenance, ownership, and disposal.

Caterpillar can improve its offer in three ways. First, it can increase total customer benefit by improving economic, functional, and psychological benefits of its product, services, people, and/or image. Second, it can reduce the buyer’s nonmonetary costs by reducing the time, energy, and psychological investment. Third, it can reduce its product’s monetary cost to the buyer.

It also implies that the seller at a disadvantage has two alternatives: increase total customer benefit or decrease total customer cost.

The former calls for strengthening or augmenting the economical, functional, and psychological benefits of the offering’s product, services, personnel, and image. The latter calls for reducing the buyer’s costs by reducing the price or cost of ownership and maintenance, simplifying the ordering and delivery process, or absorbing some buyer risk by offering a warranty.

General, satisfaction is a person’s feelings of pleasure or disappointment that result from comparing a product or service’s perceived performance (or outcome) to expectations.

In general, satisfaction is a person’s feelings of pleasure or disappointment that result from comparing a product or service’s perceived performance (or outcome) to expectations.

Companies can hire mystery shoppers to pose as potential buyers and report on strong and weak points experienced in buying the company’s and competitors’ products. Managers themselves can enter company and competitor sales situations where they are unknown and experience firsthand the treatment they receive, or they can phone their own company with questions and complaints to see how employees handle the calls.

Ultimately, marketing is the art of attracting and keeping profitable customers.

The well-known 80–20 rule states that 80 percent or more of the company’s profits come from the top 20 percent of its customers.

Some cases may be more extreme—the most profitable 20 percent of customers (on a per capita basis) may contribute as much as 150 to 300 percent of profitability.

The least profitable 10 to 20 percent, on the other hand, can actually reduce profits between 50 and 200 percent per account, with the middle 60 to 70 percent breaking even.29 The implication is that a company could improve its profits by “firing” its worst customers.

It’s not always the company’s largest customers who demand considerable service and deep discounts or who yield the most profit. The smallest customers pay full price and receive minimal service, but the costs of transacting with them can reduce their profitability. Midsize customers who receive good service and pay nearly full price are often the most profitable.

A profitable customer is a person, household, or company that over time yields a revenue stream exceeding by an acceptable amount the company’s cost stream for attracting, selling, and serving that customer.

The company must subtract from its expected revenues the expected costs of attracting, selling, and servicing the account of that customer, applying the appropriate discount rate (say, between 10 and 20 percent, depending on cost of capital and risk attitudes).

Customer lifetime value (CLV) describes the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over the customer’s lifetime purchases.

Acquiring new customers can cost five times more than satisfying and retaining current ones. It requires a great deal of effort to induce satisfied customers to switch from their current suppliers.

“If you have three yellow Mustangs sitting on a dealer’s lot and a customer wants a red one, the salesman may be really good at figuring out how to sell the yellow Mustang. So the yellow Mustang gets sold, and a signal gets sent back to the factory that, hey, people want yellow Mustangs.”5.

Before the Internet, sometimes you just had to go out in the field and watch the competition. Describing how he learned about a rival’s drilling activity, oil and gas entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens recalls, “We would have someone who would watch [the rival’s] drilling floor from a half mile away with field glasses. Our competitor didn’t like it but there wasn’t anything they could do about it. Our spotters would watch the joints and drill pipe. They would count them; each [drill] joint was 30 feet long. By adding up all the joints, you would be able to tally the depth of the well.” Pickens knew that the deeper the well, the more costly for his rival to get the oil or gas up to the surface, information that gave him an immediate competitive advantage.

A growing population does not mean growing markets unless there is sufficient purchasing power.

More people are divorcing, separating, choosing not to marry, or marrying later.

The biggest change for the decade was the jump in households headed by women without husbands—up 18 percent.

There are four types of industrial structures: subsistence economies like Papua New Guinea, with few opportunities for marketers; raw-material exporting economies like Democratic Republic of Congo (copper) and Saudi Arabia (oil), with good markets for equipment, tools, supplies, and luxury goods for the rich; industrializing economies like India, Egypt, and the Philippines, where a new rich class and a growing middle class demand new types of goods; and industrial economies like Western Europe, with rich markets for all sorts of goods.

(1) very low incomes; (2) mostly low incomes; (3) very low, very high incomes; (4) low, medium, high incomes; and (5) mostly medium incomes.

Most people in the United States still believe in working, getting married, giving to charity, and being honest.

Core beliefs and values are passed from parents to children and reinforced by social institutions—schools, churches, businesses, and governments.

Secondary beliefs and values are more open to change. Believing in the institution of marriage is a core belief; believing people should marry early is a secondary belief.

The nonprofit organization Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) does not try to stop the sale of alcohol but promotes lower legal blood-alcohol levels for driving and limited operating hours for businesses that sell alcohol.

The result is the market-penetration index. A low index indicates substantial growth potential for all the firms. A high index suggests it will be expensive to attract the few remaining prospects.

Normally, the lower the BDI, the higher the market opportunity, in that there is room to grow the brand.

Engaging students or professors to design and carry out projects—AT.

Using the Internet—A company can collect considerable information at little cost by examining competitors’ Web sites, monitoring chat rooms and blogs, and accessing published data. Social media monitoring tools from companies like Radian6, Attensity, and Lithium keep firms on top of online buzz.

Not all research can be this specific. Some is exploratory—its goal is to identify the problem and to suggest possible solutions. Some is descriptive—it seeks to quantify demand, such as how many first-class passengers would purchase ultra high-speed Wi-Fi service at $25. Some research is causal—its purpose is to test a cause-and-effect relationship.

“Tech companies design from the inside out, whereas we design from the outside in so that we can put customers first.”.

“revolutionize people’s lives by solving their important business and financial management problems.”.

According to the first, “The Law of the Few,” three types of people help to spread an idea like an epidemic. First are Mavens,people knowledgeable about big and small things. Second are Connectors, people who know and communicate with a great number of other people. Third are Salesmen, who possess natural persuasive power. Any idea that catches the interest of Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen is likely to be broadcast far and wide.

They advise marketers to cultivate “bees,” hyper devoted customers who are not satisfied just knowing about the next trend but live to spread the word.

Another area of online scoring is influence measurement. A pioneer in the field, Klout measures the clout a person has online with its Klout Scores. Klout Scores range from 0 to 100 and are based on analysis of 400 different factors—and 12 billion pieces of data a day—like how influential your followers are and how many people retweet or respond to your messages.

We can define a person’s position in each group in terms of role and status. A role consists of the activities a person is expected to perform. Each role in turn connotes a status.

Levi’s suggests a personality that is also youthful, rebellious, authentic, and American.

People will try to satisfy their most important need first and then move to the next. For example, a starving man (need 1) will not take an interest in the latest happenings in the art world (need 5), nor in the way he is viewed by others (need 3 or 4), nor even in whether he is breathing clean air (need 2), but when he has enough food and water, the next most important need will become salient.

The hedonic bias occurs when people have a general tendency to attribute success to themselves and failure to external causes.

Marketers should ask in terms of who, what, when, where, how, and why.

Problem recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and postpurchase behavior.

Prospect theory maintains that consumers frame their decision alternatives in terms of gains and losses according to a value function. Consumers are generally loss-averse. They tend to overweight very low probabilities and underweight very high probabilities.

To become a one-stop shop for all kinds of business customers, Oracle now sells everything from server computers and data storage devices to operating systems, databases, and software for running accounting, sales, and supply-chain management.

Project. Product value analysis (PVA) is an approach to cost reduction that studies whether components can be redesigned or standardized or made by cheaper methods.

To create and capture value, sellers such as Cisco must understand these organizations’ needs, resources, policies, and buying procedures.

At the height of the dot-com boom, Cisco Systems was briefly the most valuable company in the world, with a valuation of $500 billion.

Many principles of basic marketing also apply to business marketers. They need to embrace holistic marketing principles, such as building strong loyalty relationships with their customers, just like any marketer. But they also face some unique considerations in selling to other businesses.

Organizational buying as the decision-making process by which formal organizations establish the need for purchased products and services and identify, evaluate, and choose among alternative brands and suppliers.

The business market consists of all the organizations that acquire goods and services used in the production of other products or services that are sold, rented, or supplied to others.

Any firm that supplies components for products is in the business-to-business marketplace.

More dollars and items change hands in sales to business buyers than to consumers.

Given the highly competitive nature of business-to-business markets, the biggest enemy to marketers here is commoditization.6 Commoditization eats away margins and weakens customer loyalty. It can be overcome only if target customers are convinced that meaningful differences exist in the marketplace and that the unique benefits of the firm’s offerings are worth the added expense.

Thus, a critical step in business-to-business marketing is to create and communicate relevant differentiation from competitors.

(1) building stronger interfaces between marketing and sales; (2) building stronger innovation-marketing interfaces; and (3) extracting and leveraging more granular customer and market knowledge.

(1) demonstrating marketing’s contribution to business performance; (2) engaging more deeply with customers and customers’ customers; (3) finding the right mix of centralized versus decentralized marketing activities; and (4) finding and grooming marketing talent and competencies.

Professional purchasing. Business goods are often purchased by trained purchasing agents, who must follow their organizations’ purchasing policies, constraints, and requirements. Many business buying instruments— for example, requests for quotations, proposals, and purchase contracts—are not typically found in consumer buying.

This means business marketers must provide greater technical data about their product and its competitive advantages.

Multiple buying influences. More people typically influence business buying decisions. Buying committees that include technical experts and even senior management are common in the purchase of major goods. Business marketers need to send well-trained sales representatives and teams.

Pittsburgh-based Consol Energy’s coal and natural gas business largely depends on orders from utilities and steel companies, which, in turn, depend on consumer demand for electricity and for steel-based products such as automobiles, machines, and appliances.

Three types of buying situations are the straight rebuy, modified rebuy, and new task.

Straight rebuy. In a straight rebuy, the purchasing department reorders items like office supplies and bulk chemicals on a routine basis and chooses from suppliers on an approved.

Straight rebuy. In a straight rebuy, the purchasing department reorders items like office supplies and bulk chemicals on a routine basis and chooses from suppliers on an approved list.

Modified rebuy. The buyer in a modified rebuy wants to change product specifications, prices, delivery requirements, or other terms.

New task. A new-task purchaser buys a product or service for the first time (an office building, a new security system).

The buying process passes through several stages: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption.

In the new-task situation, the buyer must determine product specifications, price limits, delivery terms and times, service terms, payment terms, order quantities, acceptable suppliers, and the selected supplier.

The brand promise and the manufacturer’s name recognition will be important in establishing trust and persuading the customer to consider change.

Purchasing agents are influential in straight-rebuy and modified-rebuy situations, whereas other employees are more influential in new-buy situations. Engineers are usually influential in selecting product.

Purchasing agents are influential in straight-rebuy and modified-rebuy situations, whereas other employees are more influential in new-buy situations. Engineers are usually influential in selecting product components, and purchasing agents dominate in selecting suppliers.15.

Webster and Wind call the decision-making unit of a buying organization the buying center. It consists of “all those individuals and groups who participate in the purchasing decision-making process, who share some common goals and the risks arising from the decisions.”.

Buying centers usually include participants with differing interests, authority, status, susceptibility to persuasion, and sometimes very different decision criteria.

The business marketer is not likely to know exactly what kind of group dynamics take place during the decision process, though whatever information he or she can obtain about personalities and interpersonal factors is useful.

Small sellers concentrate on reaching the key buying influencers Larger sellers go for multilevel in-depth selling to reach as many participants as possible.

For complex items, the buyer will work with others—engineers, users—to define characteristics such as reliability, durability, or price. Business marketers can help by describing how their products meet or even exceed the buyer’s needs.

Marketers must find the right balance between the quantity and quality of leads. Too many leads, even of high quality, and the sales force may be overwhelmed and allow promising opportunities to fall through the cracks; too few or low-quality leads and the sales force may become frustrated or demoralized.

Business marketers must be skilled in researching, writing, and presenting proposals as marketing documents that describe value and benefits in customer terms. Oral presentations must inspire confidence and position the company’s capabilities and resources so they stand out from the competition.

The most important attributes are price, supplier reputation, product reliability, service reliability, and supplier flexibility.

To command price premiums in competitive B-to-B markets, firms must create compelling customer value propositions. The first step is to research the customer.

Clearly substantiate value claims by concretely specifying the differences between your offerings and those of competitors on the dimensions that matter most to the customer.

Document the value delivered by creating written accounts of costs savings or added value that existing customers have actually captured byusing your offerings.

Make sure the method of creating a customer value proposition is well implemented within the company, and train and reward employees for developing a compelling one.

(1) limited quantities, (2) no refunds, (3) no adjustments, and (4) no services.

Risk and gain sharing can offset price reductions customers request.

For maintenance, repair, and operating items, buyers are moving toward blanket contracts rather than periodic purchase orders.

For maintenance, repair, and operating items, buyers are moving toward blanket contracts rather than periodic purchase orders. A blanket contract establishes a long-term relationship in which the supplier promises to resupply the buyer as needed, at agreed-upon prices, over a specified period of time.

Business-to-business marketers are using every marketing tool at their disposal to attract and retain customers.

They are embracing systems selling and adding valuable services to their product offerings and employing customer reference programs and a wide variety of online and offline communication and branding activities.

Shell Oil manages the oil inventories of many of its business customers and knows when they require replenishment.

The seller achieves lower operating costs thanks to steady demand and reduced paperwork.

Services play an increasing strategic and financial role for many business-to-business firms selling primarily products. Adding high-quality services to their product offerings allows them to provide greater value and establish closer ties with customers.

Business-to-business marketers are avoiding “spray and pray” approaches to attracting and retaining customers in favor of honing in on their targets and developing one-to-one marketing approaches.

“We had lost the trust in relationships with our customers, and employees did not believe in management.”.

Opportunism is a concern because firms must devote resources to control and monitoring that they could otherwise allocate to more productive purposes.

The institutional market consists of schools, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, and other institutions that must provide goods and services to people in their care.

Some business-to-business marketing executives lament the challenges of business-to-business marketing, maintaining that many traditional marketing concepts and principles do not apply and that selling products and services to a company is fundamentally different from selling to individuals.

These five countries have formed an association dubbed “BRICS” (for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).20.

Some have begun grouping that country and South Africa with Columbia, Vietnam, Egypt, and Turkey, dubbing them CIVETS to raise their profile.

The unmet needs of the developing world represent huge potential markets for food, clothing, shelter, consumer electronics, appliances, and many other goods.

The world’s largest food company now gets about 40 percent of its revenue from emerging markets.

Developing markets account for about 82 percent of the world’s population, and 90 percent of future population growth is projected to occur there.

Resource-rich Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America and the sixth largest in the world.

According to a study by Goldman Sachs, it will likely move into fourth place by 2050, meaning it would economically be larger than countries like Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

The 2014 World Cup in soccer and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro will put the world’s spotlight on recent progress made by Brazil, though also highlighting some of the country’s unease in huge investments in athletic events as opposed to addressing pressing domestic concerns such as education and infrastructure.

Russia is the largest exporter of natural gas, the second-largest exporter of oil, and the third-largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) cautions that economic reforms have stagnated and ranks Russia as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

Foreign businesses complain about subsidized competition, restricted access, conflicting regulations, opaque and seemingly arbitrary bureaucracy, and lack of protection for intellectual property;.

The Chinese government encourages partnerships with foreign companies, in part so that its firms can learn enough to become global powerhouses themselves.

Even Coca-Cola is sweeter or less carbonated in certain countries.

Blue-collar workers were among the first purchasers of color television sets; it was cheaper for them to buy a television than to go to movies and restaurants.

Coca-Cola, focused on its soft drink business, missed seeing the market for coffee bars and fresh-fruit-juice bars that eventually impinged on its soft-drink business.

Marketers must overcome “marketing myopia” and stop defining competition in traditional category and industry terms.

POINTS-OF-DIFFERENCE Points-of-difference (PODs) are attributes or benefits that consumers strongly associate with a brand, positively evaluate, and believe they could not find to the same extent with a competitive brand.

Strong brands often have multiple points-of-difference. Some examples are Apple (design, ease-of-use, and irreverent attitude), Nike (performance, innovative technology, and winning), and Southwest Airlines (value, reliability, and fun personality).

When research on scar-treatment product Mederma found that women were buying it not just for the physical treatment but also to increase their self-esteem, the marketers of the brand added emotional messaging to what had traditionally been a practical message that stressed physician recommendations: “What we have done is supplement the rational with the emotional.”.

Nike’s internal mantra was “authentic athletic performance,” its external slogan was “Just Do It.”.

Strategic brand management combines the design and implementation of marketing activities and programs to build, measure, and manage brands to maximize their value.

“a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of them, intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competitors.”.

Brand equity is the added value endowed to products and services with consumers. It may be reflected in the way consumers think, feel, and act with respect to the brand, as well as in the prices, market share, and profitability it commands.

A brand has positive customer-based brand equity when consumers react more favorably to a product and the way it is marketed when the brand is identified than when it is not identified.

The quality of that investment is the critical factor, not necessarily the quantity (beyond some threshold amount). It’s actually possible to overspend on brand building if money is not spent wisely.

A brand contact is any information-bearing experience, whether positive or negative, a customer or prospect has with the brand, its product category, or its market.

When employees care about and believe in the brand, they’re motivated to work harder and feel greater loyalty to the firm.

Turning points are ideal opportunities to capture employees’ attention and imagination. After it ran an internal branding campaign to accompany its external repositioning, the “Beyond Petroleum” ad campaign, BP found most employees were positive about the new brand and thought the company was going in the right direction.

(1) what products it represents, what core benefits it supplies, and what needs it satisfies; and (2) how the brand makes products superior and which strong, favorable, and unique brand associations should exist in consumers’ minds.

The existing brand that gives birth to a brand extension or sub-brand is the parent brand.

The existing brand that gives birth to a brand extension or sub-brand is the parent brand. If the parent brand is already associated with multiple products through brand extensions, it can also be called a master brand or family brand.

A licensed product is one whose brand name has been licensed to other manufacturers that actually make the product.

Marketers must avoid the trap of thinking the “grass is always greener” and overestimating the upside of new ventures that stretch the company into uncharted territory.

Further, an industry that is red-hot today may be ice-cold tomorrow.

If Heinz can convince more people to use ketchup, or to use ketchup with more meals, or to use more ketchup on each occasion, the firm will benefit considerably because it already sells almost two-thirds of the country’s ketchup.

Orbit chewing gum puts the message, “Eat. Drink. Chew. A Good Clean Feeling.” to reinforce that the brand can be a substitute for brushing teeth.

Another approach might be to provide consumers with (1) better information about when they first used the product or need to replace it or (2) a gauge of the current level of product performance.

Gillette razor cartridges feature colored stripes that slowly fade with repeated use, signaling the user to move on to the next cartridge.

A creative marketer discovers solutions customers did not ask for but to which they enthusiastically respond.

A responsive marketer finds a stated need and fills it. An anticipative marketer looks ahead to needs customers may have in the near future.

Thus, “petroleum” companies such as BP sought to recast themselves as “energy” companies. This change required them to research the oil, coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, and chemical industries. Market diversification shifts the company’s focus into unrelated industries. When U.S. tobacco companies such as Reynolds and Philip Morris acknowledged the growing curbs on cigarette smoking, instead of defending their market position or looking for cigarette substitutes, they moved quickly into new industries such as beer, liquor, soft drinks, and frozen foods.

The follower can achieve high profits because it did not bear any of the innovation expense.

It has never been advertised, has no Facebook page and no Twitter account, and at one point had not updated its Web site in years. Because of Sriracha’s popularity, however, Huy Fong has become one of the fastest-growing U.S. food companies. Success has attracted imitators, but the firm’s revenues continue to grow by at least 20 percent a year.

Firms with low shares of the total market can become highly profitable through smart niching. They know their target customers so well they can meet their needs better than other firms by offering high value, but they can also charge a premium price, achieve lower manufacturing costs, and shape a strong corporate culture and vision.52 The nicher achieves high margin, whereas the mass marketer achieves high volume.

First movers also have to watch out for the “second-mover advantage.”.

The first step is to cut R&D costs and plant and equipment investment. The company might also reduce product quality, sales force size, marginal services, and advertising expenditures, ideally without letting customers, competitors, and employees know what is happening.

The customer will judge the offering on three basic elements: product features and quality, service mix and quality, and price (see Figure 13.1).

All three elements—products, services, and pricing—must be meshed into a competitively attractive market offering.

Hotel guest is buying rest and sleep. The purchaser of a drill is buying holes. Marketers must see themselves as benefit providers.

A hotel guest is buying rest and sleep. The purchaser of a drill is buying holes. Marketers must see themselves as benefit providers.

Unsought goods are those the consumer does not know about or normally think of buying, such as smoke detectors. Other classic examples are life insurance, cemetery plots, and gravestones. Unsought goods require advertising and personal-selling support.

Means for differentiation include form, features, performance quality, conformance quality, durability, reliability, repairability, and style.

SABMiller found that women were actually more sensitive to levels of flavor in beer and thus were better product testers.

Design thinking is a very data-driven approach with three phases: observation, ideation, and implementation. Design thinking requires intensive ethnographic studies of consumers, creative brainstorming sessions, and collaborative teamwork to decide how to bring the design idea to reality.

Supermarkets make almost no margin on bread and milk, reasonable margins on canned and frozen foods, and better margins on flowers, ethnic food lines, and freshly baked goods.

Better-trained people exhibit six characteristics that improve service quality: competence, courtesy, credibility, reliability, responsiveness, and communication skill.


# Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It (Chris Voss)

One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions.

Through decades of research with Tversky, Kahneman proved that humans all suffer from Cognitive Bias, that is, unconscious—and irrational—brain processes that literally distort the way we see the world. Kahneman and Tversky discovered more than 150 of them.

There’s the Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed (people place greater value on moving from 90 percent to 100 percent—high probability to certainty—than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though they’re both ten percentage points).

Prospect Theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. And the most famous is Loss Aversion, which shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain.

All starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing.

The whole concept, which you’ll learn as the centerpiece of this book, is called Tactical Empathy.

This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.

Your career, your finances, your reputation, your love life, even the fate of your kids—at some point all of these hinge on your ability to negotiate.

Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for.

Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you think is right.

Remember, a hostage negotiator plays a unique role: he has to win. Can he say to a bank robber, “Okay, you’ve taken four hostages. Let’s split the difference—give me two, and we’ll call it a day?” No. A successful hostage negotiator has to get everything he asks for, without giving anything back of substance, and do so in a way that leaves the adversaries feeling as if they have a great relationship. His work is emotional intelligence on steroids. Those are the tools you’ll learn here.

Here, you’ll learn why you should strive for “That’s right” instead of “Yes” at every stage of a negotiation, and how to identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm your counterpart’s worldview with Summaries and Paraphrasing.

Finally, you’ll see how to engage your counterpart by acknowledging their right to choose, and you’ll learn an email technique that ensures that you’ll never be ignored again.

Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.

Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of the reasons that really smart people often have trouble being negotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to discover.

Using what they’ve heard or their own biases, they often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to make them conform to foregone conclusions.

I hadn’t yet learned to be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns—we/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important.

I hadn’t yet learned to be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns—we/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa).

Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. In one of the most cited research papers in psychology,1 George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given.

Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. In one of the most cited research papers in psychology,1 George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In other words, we are easily overwhelmed.

In that mode of true active listening—aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—you’ll disarm your counterpart. You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down.

Their emotional intelligence is finely honed, and they’ll use hospitality and friendliness in a powerful way to draw you in and create reciprocity that ends in an exchange of money.

It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility.

Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other.

It’s generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.

We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar.

Positive reinforcement. One group of waiters, using positive reinforcement, lavished praise and encouragement on patrons using words such as “great,” “no problem,” and “sure” in response to each order. The other group of waiters mirrored their customers simply by repeating their orders back to them. The results were stunning: the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement.

■   A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.

■   Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.

■   People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.

■   Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.

“Separate the people from the problem”.

How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are the problem?.

The relationship between an emotionally intelligent negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic.

It may sound touchy-feely, but if you can perceive the emotions of others, you have a chance to turn them to your advantage. The more you know about someone, the more power you have.

“the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization of that recognition.”.

That’s an academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world.

What I’m talking about is trying to understand a situation from another person’s perspective.

Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It’s bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done. It’s emotional intelligence on steroids.

Politics aside, empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It’s about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy is in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might move them.

It’s what helped me succeed at what Sun Tzu called “the supreme art of war”: to subdue the enemy without fighting.

Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it.

First, let’s talk a little human psychology. In basic terms, people’s emotions have two levels: the “presenting” behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the “underlying” feeling is what motivates the behavior.

I’ve found the phrase “Look, I’m an asshole” to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away.

“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” I said when he answered the phone. There was a long pause at the other end of the line. “Who is this?” he said. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” I repeated. “It’s Chris Voss.” Again there was a long silence. “Does your boss know you’re here?” I said he did, and crossed my fingers. At this point, the FBI official would have been completely within his rights to tell me to leave Canada immediately. But by mentioning the negative dynamic, I knew I’d diffused it as much as I could. I had a chance.

“I’m sensing some hesitation with these projects,” she said in what she hoped was a level voice. As if she’d been uncorked, the woman exclaimed: “I want my gift to directly support programming for Girl Scouts and not anything else.”.

So I don’t ask. Instead, I say, “In case you’re worried about volunteering to role-play with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance . . . it’s going to be horrible.” After the laughter dies down, I then say, “And those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else.”.

Now, look at what I did: I prefaced the conversation by labeling my audience’s fears; how much worse can something be than “horrible”? I defuse them and wait, letting it sink in and thereby making the unreasonable seem less forbidding.

“No, I do not need water, carbon filtered or otherwise. I’m a camel!”.

Pushing hard for “Yes” doesn’t get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side.

So if “Yes” can be so damn uncomfortable, and “No” such a relief, why have we fetishized one and demonized the other?.

It comes down to the deep and universal human need for autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person’s autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say “No” to your ideas, the emotions calm, the effectiveness of the decisions go up, and the other party can really look at your proposal.

I’ll let you in on a secret. There are actually three kinds of “Yes”: Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment.

And sadly, if we believe that we can control or manage others’ decisions with compromise and logic, we’re leaving millions on the table.

An early “Yes” is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.

Saying “No” gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. You use a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he’s in the driver’s seat. Good negotiators welcome—even invite—a solid “No” to start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking.

“Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus.

But human beings are innately jealous, and her immediate supervisor was no exception to that rule.

“Every ‘No’ gets me closer to a ‘Yes.’” But then I remind them that extracting those “No’s” on the road to “Yes” isn’t always easy.

Our love of hearing “yes” makes us blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel when someone is pushing us to say it.

That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is always better than “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”.

“It seems like you want this project to fail”—that.

It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.

Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you.

The model proposes five stages—active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change—that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.

The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct.

Who proposed that real change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as he or she is—an approach known as unconditional positive regard. The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct.

The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for most of us the positive regard we experience is conditional, we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little.

Which is why so few social interactions lead to actual behavior change.

“This surgery isn’t a cure. The only way to truly prolong your life is to make the following behavior changes . . .” The grateful patient responds: “Yes, yes, yes, of course, Doctor! This is my second chance. I will change!” And do they? Study after study has shown that, no, nothing changes; two years after their operation, more than 90 percent of patients haven’t changed their lifestyle at all.

“yes.” As you’ll soon learn, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually “That’s right.”.

Before you convince them to see what you’re trying to accomplish, you have to say the things to them that will get them to say, “That’s right.”.

The “that’s right” breakthrough usually doesn’t come at the beginning of a negotiation. It’s invisible to the counterpart when it occurs, and they embrace what you’ve said. To them, it’s a subtle epiphany.

Driving toward “that’s right” is a winning strategy in all negotiations. But hearing “you’re right” is a disaster.

Why is “you’re right” the worst answer? Consider this: Whenever someone is bothering you, and they just won’t let up, and they won’t listen to anything you have to say, what do you tell them to get them to shut up and go away? “You’re right.”.

With those words Brandon embraced the reality of what was holding him back. Once he understood why he was trying to knock down every blocker, he changed course. He started avoiding the blocks and became an exceptionally fine linebacker.

“Sleeping in the same bed and dreaming different dreams” is an old Chinese expression that describes the intimacy.

“Sleeping in the same bed and dreaming different dreams” is an old Chinese expression that describes the intimacy of partnership (whether in marriage or in business) without the communication necessary to sustain it.

The moment you’ve convinced someone that you truly understand her dreams and feelings (the whole world that she inhabits), mental and behavioral change becomes possible, and the foundation for a breakthrough has been laid. Use these lessons to lay that foundation:.

I was the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator.

“If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you’re wrong,” I say. “That’s not empathy; that’s projection.”.

“And for you accepters who turned down $1, since when is getting $0 better than getting $1? Did the rules of finance suddenly change?”.

Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money.

For Iran, it’s not fair that the global powers—which together have several thousand nuclear weapons—should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy. And why, Iran wonders, is it considered a pariah for enriching uranium when India and Pakistan, which clandestinely acquired nuclear weapons, are.

For Iran, it’s not fair that the global powers—which together have several thousand nuclear weapons—should be able to decide if it can use nuclear energy. And why, Iran wonders, is it considered a pariah for enriching uranium when India and Pakistan, which clandestinely acquired nuclear weapons, are accepted members of the international community?.

“Okay, I apologize. Let’s stop everything and go back to where I started treating you unfairly and we’ll fix it.”.

If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply mirror the “F” that has just been lobbed at you. “Fair?” you’d respond, pausing to let the word’s power do to them as it was intended to do to you. Follow that with a label: “It seems like you’re ready to provide the evidence that supports that,” which alludes to opening their books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to work with than you had previously. Right away, you declaw the attack.

“I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address.

“I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.”.

A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become a Rainmaker,3 and I like to review it occasionally to refresh my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. If you can get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.

The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion.

The chance for loss incites more risk than the possibility of an equal gain.

In a tough negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have.

In a tough negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.

So start out with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears.

Well, when you are selling yourself to a manager, sell yourself as more than a body for a job; sell yourself, and your success, as a way they can validate their own intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company. Make sure they know you’ll act as a flesh-and-blood argument for their importance. Once you’ve bent their reality to include you as their ambassador, they’ll have a stake in your success.

Ask: “What does it take to be successful here?”.

The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. You’ve just recruited your first unofficial mentor.

“I’m asking you, not the board, for the promotion, and all I need is for you to agree with it,” he said. And how did Angel’s boss reply to his new ambassador? “I’ll fight to get you this salary.” So follow Angel’s lead and make it rain!.

Theories—some great and some completely harebrained—and.

We learned that negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating.

It involved giving him the illusion of control while you, in fact, were the one defining the conversation.

I’ll explain it in depth later on, but for now let me say that it’s really as simple as removing the hostility from the statement “You can’t leave” and turning it into a question. “What do you hope to achieve by going?”.

Whether we like to recognize it or not, a universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return. And they won’t give anything else until you pay them.

Instead of asking some closed-ended question with a single correct answer, he’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem.

It’s a “how” question, and “how” engages because “how” asks for help.

And the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control.

He talks about what he calls “unbelief,” which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. That’s where the two parties in a negotiation usually start. If you.

He talks about what he calls “unbelief,” which is active resistance to what the other side is saying, complete rejection. That’s where the two parties in a negotiation usually start.

You don’t directly persuade them to see your ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas. As the saying goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which it is going.

“Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check,” Dutton says. “Without it, there’d be no limits.”.

“He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.”.

When you go into a store, instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions.

Then, once you’ve picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: “How am I supposed to do that?” The critical part of this approach is that you really are asking for help and your delivery must convey that. With this negotiating scheme, instead of bullying the clerk, you’re asking for their advice and giving them the illusion of control.

And that’s the difference between “You’re screwing me out of money, and it has to stop” and “How am I supposed to do that?”.

If you can’t control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another party?.

When negotiating with a foreigner, it’s common practice for a Japanese businessman to use a translator even when he understands perfectly what the other side is saying. That’s because speaking through a translator forces him to step back. It gives him time to frame his response.

That’s because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he’s trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He’s.

That’s because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he’s trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He’s harnessing the talker’s energy for his own ends.

■   Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.

■   Avoid questions that can be answered with “Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back.

■   Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.

And that’s crucial. People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it’s theirs.

That is simply human nature. That’s why negotiation is often called “the art of letting someone else have your way.”.

That can be easy as asking a few calibrated questions, like “How does this affect the rest of your team?” or “How on board are the people not on this call?” or simply “What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?” The larger concept I’m explaining here is that in any negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space.

How does this affect everybody else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we make sure that we deliver the right material to the right people? How do we ensure the managers of those we’re training are fully on board?.

That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent.

That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face.

First, pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words.

Three. The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you’re trying to drill into at the moment. In doing so, it uncovers problems before they happen. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. When I first learned this skill, my biggest fear was how to avoid sounding like a broken record or coming off as really pushy.

The first time they agree to something or give you a commitment, that’s No. 1. For No. 2 you might label or summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.” And No. 3 could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question about implementation that asks them to explain what will constitute success, something like “What do we do if we get off track?”.

On average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than I, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie.

People who are lying are, understandably, more worried about being believed, so they work harder—too hard, as it were—at being believable.

Any response that’s not an outright rejection of your offer means you have the edge.

Skilled bargainers see more than just opening offers, counteroffers, and closing moves.

To be good, you have to learn to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you have to add to your strengths, not replace them.

The Black Swan rule is don’t treat others the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated.

“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”.

“That is a very generous offer given your budget limits, but I am not sure how that would help us achieve a great reception for the alums in the region,”.

“I have a very high amount in my head: $1,000 is what we need.”.

We’ve said previously that no deal is better than a bad deal. If you feel you can’t say “No” then you’ve taken yourself hostage.

But it works on our human nature. Notice that you can’t buy anything for $2, but you can buy a million things for $1.99. How does a cent change anything? It doesn’t. But it makes a difference every time. We just like $1.99 more than $2.00 even if we know it’s a trick.

People had always predicted that the next swan they saw would be white, but the discovery of black swans shattered this worldview.

Donald Trump has tons of power, but if he’s stranded in a desert and the owner of the only store for miles has the water he wants, the vendor has the leverage. One way.

Donald Trump has tons of power, but if he’s stranded in a desert and the owner of the only store for miles has the water he wants, the vendor has the leverage.

Who is their audience? What signifies status and reputation to them? What most worries them? To find this information, one method is to go outside the negotiating table and speak to a third party that knows your counterpart. The most effective method is to gather it from interactions with your counterpart.

“It seems like you strongly value the fact that you’ve always paid on time” or “It seems like you don’t care what position you are leaving me in” can really open up the negotiation process.

People will often sooner die than give up their autonomy.

Couldn’t threaten to kill him and expect that to work. The reason for that is something called the “paradox of power”—namely, the harder we push the more likely we are to be met with resistance.

“Oh, we see the world the same way,”.

That’s why in many cultures negotiators spend large amounts of time building rapport before they even think of offers.

“Negotiations with religious fanatics who have delusions of grandeur generally do not go well.”.

Great at anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife—you’re going to have to do that. You’re going to have to ignore that little genie who’s telling you to give up, to just get along—as well as that other genie who’s telling you to lash out and yell.

Whether it’s in the office or around the family dinner table, don’t avoid honest, clear conflict. It will get you the best car price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. It will also save your marriage, your friendship, and your family.

When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion—you fall to your highest level of preparation.

Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those.

People who expect more (and articulate it) get more. Here are the four steps.

People who expect more (and articulate it) get more.

■   Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly. ■   Write it down. ■   Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out). ■   Carry the written goal into the negotiation.

“You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it’s whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.”.


# Originals by Adam Grant (null)

Procrastination, caution, and balancing risks actually help to unleash originality.

Originals are the ones who reject the default option, produce a lot of work, and take the time to recognize the original idea.

Originals take the time to build their status so that they can persuade others; and they don’t shy from laying out the negatives of their idea up front.

Don’t accept the default option.

They are hindered by achievement motivation—a phenomenal drive to succeed that ends up crowding out originality.

They are hindered by achievement motivation—a phenomenal drive to succeed that ends up crowding out originality. Their fear of failure is so great that it prevents them from pursuing new ideas.

If you have some doubts about what you are doing, you are more likely to build a business venture that will last.

When we cover our bases, we are freed from the pressure to pursue a half-baked idea or launch an untested business.

The biggest barrier to originality is not idea generation, it’s idea selection.

Our companies, communities, and countries are full of novel ideas—the problem is a lack of people who excel at choosing the right novel ideas.

Einstein had 248 publications, only a handful of which (on general and special relativity) transformed physics.

A scientist who plays a musical instrument is twice as likely to win a Nobel relative to other scientists; someone who draws or paints is seven times as likely to win; a creative writer is 12 times more likely to win; and an amateur actor or dancer is an astonishing 22 times more likely to win a Nobel than other scientists.

If you want to influence others, you first have to earn their respect.

If you want to influence others, you first have to earn their respect. Medina was trying to exercise power—getting a new idea accepted—without having the status to back it up.

Exit, meaning remove yourself from the situation; voice, or actively try to change the situation; persistence, meaning stick with it; or, neglect, which entails staying put but reducing your effort.

The only time when you can and should speak up is when you believe your actions matter and you care deeply about trying to make a change.

For women and minorities—and especially for women who are minorities—it is particularly important to earn status before exercising power.

Instead of saying, “You need to do this!” Medina had greater success in her second attempt to pitch her idea by saying, “Maybe I’m wrong, but perhaps we should try...”.


# Why I am an Atheist (null)

It is easy to understand but how is it possible that a believer can turn into a non-believer because of his vanity? Only two things are possible: either a man deems himself to be in possession of Godly qualities, or he goes a step further and declares himself to be a god.

“Religion is the outcome of human weakness or the limitation of human knowledge.”.

You go against popular feelings; you criticise a hero, a great man who is generally believed to be above criticism. What happens? No one will answer your arguments in a rational way; rather you will be considered vainglorious. Its reason is mental insipidity. Merciless criticism and independent thinking are the two necessary traits of revolutionary thinking. As Mahatmaji is great, he is above criticism; as he has risen above, all that he says in the field of politics, religion, Ethics is right. You agree or not, it is binding upon you to take it as truth. This is not constructive thinking. We do not take a leap forward; we go many steps back.

“philosophy is the outcome of human weakness.”.

But belief, I should say blind belief is disastrous. It deprives a man of his understanding power and makes him reactionary.

When informed of my atheism, he said, “When your last days come, you will begin to believe.” I said, “No, dear sir, Never shall it happen. I consider it to be an act of degradation and demoralisation. For such petty selfish motives, I shall never pray.” Reader and friends, is it vanity? If it is, I stand for it.

Highlights don't work on pages that change a lot, like this one. Sorry about that.

You've blocked highlights here.

I studied Bakunin, the anarchist leader. I read a few books of Marx, the father of Communism. I also read Lenin and Trotsky and many other writers who successfully carried out revolutions in their countries. All of them were atheists.

Beliefs make it easier to go through hardships, even make them pleasant. Man can find a strong support in God and an encouraging consolation in His Name. If you have no belief in Him, then there is no alternative but to depend upon yourself. It is not child’s play to stand firm on your feet amid storms and strong winds. In difficult times, vanity, if it remains, evaporates and man cannot find the courage to defy beliefs held in common esteem by the people. If he really revolts against such beliefs, we must conclude that it is not sheer vanity; he has some kind of extraordinary strength. This is exactly the situation now.

If he really revolts against such beliefs, we must conclude that it is not sheer vanity; he has some kind of extraordinary strength. This is exactly the situation now. First of all we all know what the judgement will be. It is to be pronounced in a week or so. I am going to sacrifice my life for a cause. What more consolation can there be! A God-believing Hindu may expect to be reborn a king; a Muslim or a Christian might dream of the luxuries he hopes to enjoy in paradise as a reward for his sufferings and sacrifices. What hope should I entertain? I know that will be the end when the rope is tightened round my neck and the rafters move from under my feet. To use more precise religious terminology, that will be the moment of utter annihilation. My soul will come to nothing. If I take the courage to take the matter in the light of ‘Reward’, I see that a short life of struggle with no such magnificent end shall itself be my ‘Reward.’ That is all. Without any selfish motive of getting any reward here or in the hereafter, quite disinterestedly have I devoted my life to the cause of freedom. I could not act otherwise. The day shall usher in a new era of liberty when a large number of men and women, taking courage from the idea of serving humanity and liberating them from sufferings and distress, decide that there is no alternative before them except devoting their lives for this cause. They will wage a war against their oppressors, tyrants or exploiters, not to become kings, or to gain any reward here or in the next birth or after death in paradise; but to cast off the yoke of slavery, to establish liberty and peace they will tread this perilous, but glorious path. Can the pride they take in their noble cause be called vanity? Who is there rash enough to call it so? To him I say either he is foolish or wicked. Leave such a fellow alone for he cannot realise the depth, the emotions, the sentiment and the noble feelings that surge in that heart. His heart is dead, a mere lump of flesh, devoid of feelings. His convictions are infirm, his emotions feeble. His selfish interests have made him incapable of seeing the truth. The epithet ‘vanity’ is always hurled at the strength we get from our convictions.

Whosoever undergoes sufferings in this life, must have been a sinner in his previous birth. It is tantamount to saying that those who are oppressors now were Godly people then, in their previous births. For this reason alone they hold power in their hands. Let me say it plainly that your ancestors were shrewd people. They were always in search of petty hoaxes to play upon people and snatch from them the power of Reason. Let us analyse how much this argument carries weight!.

It attributes His origin to the ingenuity of exploiters who wanted to keep the people under their subjugation by preaching the existence of a Supreme Being; thus claimed an authority and sanction from Him for their privileged position. I do not differ on the essential point that all religions, faiths, theological philosophies, and religious creeds and all other such institutions in the long run become supporters of the tyrannical and exploiting institutions, men and classes. Rebellion against any king has always been a sin in every religion.

As regard the origin of God, my thought is that man created God in his imagination when he realized his weaknesses, limitations and shortcomings. In this way he got the courage to face all the trying circumstances and to meet all dangers that might occur in his life and also to restrain his outbursts in prosperity and affluence. God, with his whimsical laws and parental generosity was painted with variegated colours of imagination. He was used as a deterrent factor when his fury and his laws were repeatedly propagated so that man might not become a danger to society. He was the cry of the distressed soul for he was believed to stand as father and mother, sister and brother, brother and friend when in time of distress a man was left alone and helpless. He was Almighty and could do anything. The idea of God is helpful to a man in distress.


# Reservoir Simulation – Basics (forestjiang)

The two main reasons are: 1. it is in the underground, you can not see it and measure properties directly; and 2. it is formed by natural deposition combined with very complicated geological processes (wind, river, ocean, etc.), it is not made from a factory by modern technology. Even the geometric extent of the reservoir is very complicated to describe.

# Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science (Wheelan, Charles)

“An economist is someone who is good with numbers but does not have the personality to be an accountant.”.

But that we are far from understanding everything does not mean that we understand nothing.

That if you spent fourteen minutes talking to an economist you would have wasted twelve minutes.

Economists overwhelmingly agree that free international trade can improve the standard of living of the trading countries and that tariffs and import quotas reduce general welfare. Economists generally agree that rent controls reduce the volume and quality of housing.

It asks how much extra benefit can be achieved by incurring some extra cost.

Finally, the economist has a predilection to believe that welfare is increased by allowing individuals to make their own choices and to argue that competitive markets are a particularly efficient mechanism for giving expression to individual choices.

I have often considered writing a basic introduction to economics myself, but competing projects always intervened. Had I done so, this is the book I would have wanted to write.

Why basic economics made the collapse of the Soviet Union inevitable (allocating resources without a price system is overwhelmingly difficult in the long run),.

What economic benefit smokers provide for nonsmokers (they die earlier, leaving more Social Security and pension benefits for the rest of us),.

Why mandating more generous maternity leave benefits may actually be detrimental to women (employers may discriminate against young women when hiring).

The French government in 2000 undertook a program to tackle chronic double-digit unemployment with a policy that was the economic equivalent of fool’s gold.

The Socialist-led government lowered the maximum workweek from thirty-nine hours to thirty-five hours; the supposed logic was that if all people with jobs work fewer hours, then there will be work left over for the unemployed to do. The policy did have a certain intuitive appeal; then again, so does using leeches to suck toxins out of the body. Sadly, neither leeches nor a shorter workweek will cause anything but harm in the long run.

Suppose that ten job applicants are vying for a single position. Nine of the job candidates are white and one is black. The hiring company has an affirmative action policy stipulating that when minority and nonminority candidates are of equal merit, the minority candidate will be hired.

Further suppose that there are two top candidates; one is white, the other is black. True to policy, the firm hires the black candidate. Loury (who is black) makes this subtle but simple point: Only one of the white candidates has suffered from affirmative action; the other eight wouldn’t have gotten the job anyway. Yet all nine white candidates go away angry, feeling that they have been discriminated against. Loury is not necessarily a foe of affirmative action. He merely adds nuance to a discussion that usually has none. Affirmative action can harm the very race relations that it seeks to heal.

Or consider the periodic campaign to mandate that insurance companies cover the cost of two nights in the hospital for women who have delivered babies, rather than just one. President Bill Clinton found this issue sufficiently important that he vowed in his 1998 State of the Union address to end “drive-by deliveries.” But there is a cost to such a plan that should be made explicit. An extra night in the hospital is not medically necessary in most cases, but it is expensive, which is why new parents don’t pay for it themselves and insurance companies don’t want to pay for it either. If insurance companies are forced to offer this benefit (or any other new benefit mandated by law), then they will recover their extra costs by raising premiums. And when premiums go up, some people on the margin will no longer be able to afford any health insurance at all. So the real policy question is: Are we willing to pass a law that will make many women more comfortable if it means that a much smaller number of men and women will lose coverage for basic care?.

The more generous a health care system is in the benefits it guarantees, the more it is going to cost.

Economics presents us with a powerful, and not necessarily complex, set of analytical tools that can be used to look back and explain why events unfolded the way they did; to look around and make sense of the world; and to look forward so that we can anticipate the effects of major policy changes. Economics is like gravity: Ignore it and you will be in for some rude surprises.

More mortgages meant more commissions, and bigger mortgages meant bigger commissions.

And it can be explained best by incorporating psychology into economics, namely the tendency of individuals to believe that whatever is happening now is what’s most likely to happen in the future.

We humans underestimate some risks (obesity) and overestimate others (flying);.

We humans underestimate some risks (obesity) and overestimate others (flying); we let emotion cloud our judgment; we overreact to both good news and bad news (rising home prices and then falling home prices).

This book is not economics for dummies; it is economics for smart people who never studied economics (or have only a vague recollection of doing so). Most of the great ideas in economics are intuitive when the dressings of complexity are peeled away. That is naked economics.

There is a finite supply of everything worth having: oil, coconut milk, perfect bodies, clean water, people who can fix jammed photocopy machines, etc.

Economics starts with one very important assumption: Individuals act to make themselves as well off as possible.

The phrase “luxury good” actually has a technical meaning to economists; it is a good that we buy in increasing quantities as we grow richer—things like sports cars and French wines. Less obviously, concern for the environment is a luxury good.

The reason is simple enough: We care about the fate of the Bengal tiger because we can. We have homes and jobs and clean water and birthday cakes for our dogs.

Why did the chicken cross the road? Because it maximized his utility.

We may spend years in graduate school eating ramen noodles because it dramatically boosts our standard of living later in life.

When you bought this book, you implicitly decided not to spend that money somewhere else. (Even if you shoplifted the book, you could have stuffed a Stephen King novel in your jacket instead, which is flattering in its own kind of way.).

At the moment, you are reading instead of working, playing with the dog, applying to law school, shopping for groceries, or having sex. Life is about trade-offs, and so is economics.

My dad would say that we try to get the most bang for our buck.

Choose to market cigarettes. Similarly, the concept of cost is far richer (pardon the pun) than the dollars and cents you hand over at the cash register.

The real cost of something is what you must give up in order to get it, which is almost always more than just cash.

There is nothing “free” about concert tickets if you have to stand in line in the rain for six hours to get them.

Standing outside an office building when it is seventeen degrees outside is now part of the cost of smoking at work.

Why did the entrepreneur cross the road? Because he could make more money on the other side.

Why doesn’t Brad Pitt sell automobile insurance? Because it would be an enormous waste of his unique talents. Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell.

Why doesn’t Brad Pitt sell automobile insurance? Because it would be an enormous waste of his unique talents. Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell more insurance policies than the average salesman. But he is also one of a handful of people in the world who can “open” a movie, meaning that millions of people around the world will go to see a film just because Brad Pitt is in it.

Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell more insurance policies than the average salesman. But he is also one of a handful of people in the world who can “open” a movie, meaning that millions of people around the world will go to see a film just because Brad Pitt is in it. That is money in the bank in the risky Hollywood movie business, so studios are willing to pay handsomely to put Brad Pitt in a starring role—about $30 million a film. Insurance agencies would also be willing to pay for the Pitt charisma—but more like $30,000. Brad Pitt will go where he is paid the most. And he will be paid the most in Hollywood because that is where he can add the most value.

Sherwin Rosen dubbed the “superstar” phenomenon. Small differences in talent tend to become magnified into huge differentials in pay as a market becomes very large, such as the audience for professional basketball. One need only be slightly better than the competition in order to gain a large (and profitable) share of that market.

Labor is cheap in Nepal; lawn mowers are very expensive. The opposite is true in the United States, which is why we don’t see many teams of laborers using sickles.

The price will settle at the point where the number of dogs for sale exactly matches the number of dogs that consumers want to buy. If there are more potential pet owners than dogs available, then the price of dogs will go up. Some consumers will then decide to buy ferrets instead, and some pet shops will be induced by the prospect of higher profits to offer more dogs for sale. Eventually the supply of dogs will match the demand.

Look around and you will start to see it everywhere. Al Gore complained during the 2000 presidential campaign that his mother and his dog were taking the same arthritis medication but that his mother paid much more for her prescription.

Al Gore complained during the 2000 presidential campaign that his mother and his dog were taking the same arthritis medication but that his mother paid much more for her prescription.

So the profit-maximizing strategy is to charge one price for patients with two legs and another price for patients with four.

Consumers try to make themselves as well off as possible and firms try to maximize profits. Those are seemingly simple concepts, yet they can tell us a tremendous amount about how the world works.

The market rewards scarcity, which has no inherent relation to value. Diamonds.

The market does not provide goods that we need; it provides goods that we want to buy.

Our medical system does not provide health insurance for the poor. Why? Because they can’t pay for it. Our most talented doctors do provide breast enhancements and face-lifts for Hollywood stars. Why? Because they can pay for it. Meanwhile, firms can make a lot of money doing nasty things. Why do European crime syndicates kidnap young girls in Eastern Europe and sell them into prostitution in wealthier countries? Because it’s profitable.

Periodically the oil ministers from the OPEC nations will meet in an exotic locale and agree to limit the global production of oil. Several things happen shortly thereafter: (1) Oil and gas prices start to go up; and (2) politicians begin falling all over themselves with ideas, mostly bad, for intervening in the oil market. But high prices are like a fever; they are both a symptom and a potential cure. While politicians are puffing away on the House floor, some other crucial things start to happen. We drive less. We get one heating bill and decide to insulate the attic. We go to the Ford showroom and walk past the Expeditions to the Escorts.

High oil prices cause things to start happening on the supply side, too. Oil producers outside of OPEC start pumping more oil to take advantage of the high price; indeed, the OPEC countries usually begin cheating on their own production quotas. Domestic oil companies begin pumping oil from wells that were not economical when the price of petroleum was low. Meanwhile, a lot of very smart people begin working more seriously on finding and commercializing alternative sources of energy.

I will argue that a market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: a decent, if flawed, choice among many bad alternatives.

I will argue that a market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: a decent, if flawed, choice among many bad alternatives. Markets are consistent with our views of individual liberty. We may disagree over whether or not the government should compel us to wear motorcycle helmets, but most of us agree that the state should not tell us where to live, what to do for a living, or how to spend our money.

During the twentieth century, communist governments killed some 100 million of their own people in peacetime, either by repression or by famine.

The economic battle of the twentieth century was between capitalism and communism.

An effective conservation strategy must properly align the incentives of the people who live in or near the black rhino’s natural habitat.

“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”.

These kinds of inefficiencies can also exist in nominally capitalist countries where large sectors of the economy are owned and operated by the state, such as India. By 1991, the Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation had been up and running for twelve years.3 Every day, twelve hundred employees reported to work with the avowed goal of producing fertilizer. There was just one small complication: The plant had never actually produced any salable fertilizer. None. Government bureaucrats ran the plant using public funds; the machinery that was installed never worked properly. Nevertheless, twelve hundred workers came to work every day and the government continued to pay their salaries.

Scandinavian countries, which offer generous government programs funded by high marginal tax rates, have seen large growth in the size of their black market economies.

Private costs of my behavior are different from the social costs.

We tallied up the costs of driving an Explorer rather than a Civic: more gas, more expensive insurance, higher car payments.

At the same time, smokers do provide a benefit to the rest of us. They die young. According to the American Lung Association, the average smoker dies seven years earlier than the average nonsmoker, which means that smokers pay into Social Security and private pension funds for all of their working lives but then don’t stick around very long to collect the benefits. Nonsmokers, on average, get more back relative to what they paid.

(And it’s arguable that some people in cold climates will benefit from climate change, so maybe they should pay me.).

To begin with, government sets the rules. Countries without functioning governments are not oases of free market prosperity. They are places in which it is expensive and difficult to conduct even the simplest business. Nigeria has one of the world’s largest reserves of oil and natural gas, yet firms trying to do business there face a problem known locally as BYOI—bring your own infrastructure.6 Angola is rich with oil and diamonds, but the wealth has financed more than a decade of civil war, not economic prosperity. In 1999, Angola’s rulers spent $900 million in oil revenues to purchase weapons. Never mind that one child in three dies before the age of five and life expectancy is a shocking forty-two years.7 These are not countries in which the market economy has failed; they are countries in which the government has failed to develop and sustain the institutions necessary to support a market economy. A report issued by the United Nations Development Program placed much of the blame for world poverty on bad government. Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work, the report concluded.

Government lowers the cost of doing business in the private sector in all kinds of ways: by providing uniform rules and regulations, such as contract law; by rooting out fraud; by circulating a sound currency. Government builds and maintains infrastructure—roads, bridges, ports, and dams—that makes private commerce less costly.

Contrary to popular opinion, most government benefits do not go to the poor; they go to the middle class in the form of Medicare and Social Security.

Still, government has the legal authority to play Robin Hood; other governments around the world, such as the European countries, do so quite actively. What does economics have to say about this? Not much, unfortunately. The most important questions related to income distribution require philosophical or ideological answers, not economic ones.

Economics does not provide the tools for answering philosophical questions related to income distribution.

If policymakers are concerned about some individual behavior, such as inadequate retirement savings, then the libertarian paternalistic option is to make the default option one that automatically puts a decent amount of money from every paycheck into a retirement account. That’s the “nudge.” Anyone is free to choose another option at any time. But a shockingly high proportion of people will stay wherever you put them in the first place.

There is an old joke, one of Ronald Reagan’s favorites, that goes something like this: A Soviet woman is trying to buy a Lada, one of the cheap automobiles made in the former Soviet Union. The dealer tells her that there is a shortage of these cars, despite their reputation for shoddy quality. Still, the woman insists on placing an order. The dealer gets out a large, dusty ledger and adds the woman’s name to the long waiting list. “Come back two years from now on March 17th,” he says. The woman consults her calendar. “Morning or afternoon?” she asks. “What difference does it make?” the surly dealer replies. “That’s two years from now!” “The plumber is coming that day,” she says.

Wen Kilama once famously pointed out that if seven Boeing 747s, mostly filled with children, crashed into Mt. Kilimanjaro every day, then the world would take notice. That is the scale on which malaria kills its victims.).

Specifically, the law stipulates that a technical college must provide 168 square feet of building space for each student (to ensure adequate space for learning). That formula precludes the Principal K. M. Kundnani College of Pharmacy from teaching more than 300 students—regardless of the fact that all the lecture halls on the top floor of the building are padlocked for lack of use.

True, the government can create jobs by spending billions of dollars on jet fighters, but we are paying for those jets with money from our paychecks, which means that we buy fewer televisions, we give less to charity, we take fewer vacations. Thus, government is not necessarily creating jobs; it may be simply moving them around, or, on net, destroying them. This effect of taxation is less obvious than the new defense plant at which happy workers churn out shiny airplanes.

(As one policy analyst once pointed out to me, it may be easy to lie with statistics, but it’s a lot easier to lie without them.).

“I know I’m wasting half my money; I just wish I knew which half.”.

Branding solves a problem for consumers: How do you select products whose quality or safety you can determine only after you use them (and sometimes not even then)?.

How does a firm save its profits from the death spiral of competition? By convincing the world (rightfully or not) that its mixture of corn syrup and water is different from everyone else’s mixture of corn syrup and water. Coca-Cola is not soda; it’s Coke. Producers of branded goods create a monopoly for themselves—and price their products accordingly—by persuading consumers that their products are like no other.

Nike clothes are not pieces of fabric sewn together by workers in Vietnam; they are Tiger Woods’s clothes. Even farmers have taken this message to heart. At the supermarket, one finds (and pays a premium for) Sunkist oranges, Angus beef, Tyson chickens.

And then there is Oprah’s book club, which has the capacity to send obscure books rocketing up the best-seller lists.

Harvard graduates do very well in life, but is that because they learned things at Harvard that made them successful, or is it because Harvard finds and admits talented students who would have done extraordinarily well in life anyway? In other words, does Harvard add great value to its students, or does it simply provide an elaborate “signaling” mechanism that allows bright students to advertise their talents to the world by being admitted to Harvard?.

“Children Smart Enough to Get into Elite Schools May Not Need to Bother.”.

“Don’t believe that the only school worth attending is one that would not admit you…. Recognize that your own motivation, ambition and talents will determine your success more than the college name on your diploma.”.

Human capital is the sum total of skills embodied within an individual: education, intelligence, charisma, creativity, work experience, entrepreneurial vigor, even the ability to throw a baseball fast.

Human capital is the sum total of skills embodied within an individual: education, intelligence, charisma, creativity, work experience, entrepreneurial vigor, even the ability to throw a baseball fast. It is what you would be left with if someone stripped away all of your assets—your job, your money, your home, your possessions—and left you on a street corner with only the clothes on your back. How would Bill Gates fare in such a situation? Very well. Even if his wealth were confiscated, other companies would snap him up as a consultant, a board member, a CEO, a motivational speaker. (When Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, the company that he founded, he turned around and founded Pixar; only later did Apple invite him back.) How would Tiger Woods do? Just fine. If someone lent him golf clubs, he could be winning a tournament by the weekend.

College education is reckoned to yield about a 10 percent return on investment, meaning that if you put down money today for college tuition, you can expect to earn that money back plus about 10 percent a year in higher earnings. Few people on Wall Street make better investments than that on a regular basis.

One handy trick in finance and economics is the rule of 72; divide 72 by a rate of growth (or a rate of interest) and the answer will tell you roughly how long it will take for a growing quantity to double (e.g., the principal in a bank account paying 4 percent interest will double in roughly 18 years). When productivity grows at 2.7 percent a year, our standard of living doubles every twenty-seven years. At 1.4 percent, it doubles every fifty-one years.

If productivity grows at 4 percent in Japan and 2 percent in the United States, then both countries are getting richer. To understand why, go back to our simple farm economy. If one farmer is raising 2 percent more corn and hogs every year and his neighbor is raising 4 percent more, then they are eating more every year (or trading more away).

If productivity grows at 4 percent in Japan and 2 percent in the United States, then both countries are getting richer. To understand why, go back to our simple farm economy. If one farmer is raising 2 percent more corn and hogs every year and his neighbor is raising 4 percent more, then they are eating more every year (or trading more away). If this disparity goes on for a long time, one of them will become significantly richer than the other, which may become a source of envy or political friction, but they are both growing steadily better off.

What would be the effect on America if 500 million people in India became more productive and gradually moved from poverty to the middle class? We would become richer, too. Poor villagers currently subsisting on $1 a day cannot afford to buy our software, our cars, our music, our books, our agricultural exports. If they were wealthier, they could. Meanwhile, some of those 500 million people, whose potential is currently wasted for lack of education, would produce goods and services that are superior to what we have now, making us better off. One of those newly educated peasants might be the person who discovers an AIDS vaccine or a process for reversing global warming. To paraphrase the United Negro College Fund, 500 million minds are a terrible thing to waste.

A woman in their sample was significantly more likely to seek paid employment if her sister’s husband earned more than her own.

Cornell economist Robert Frank, author of Luxury Fever, has made a persuasive case that relative wealth—the size of my pie compared to my neighbor’s—is an important determinant of our utility.

(A) You earn $110,000 and everyone else earns $200,000; or (B) you earn $100,000 and everyone else earns $85,000.

You would be richer in World A; you would be less wealthy in World B but richer than everyone else.

There a point at which income inequality stops motivating us to work harder and becomes counterproductive?.

Is there a point at which income inequality stops motivating us to work harder and becomes counterproductive?.

The subject of human capital begs some final questions. Will the poor always be with us, as Jesus once admonished? Does our free market system make poverty inevitable? Must there be losers if there are huge economic winners? No, no, and no. Economic development is not a zero-sum game; the world does not need poor countries in order to have rich countries, nor must some people be poor in order for others to be rich. Families who live in public housing on the South Side of Chicago are not poor because Bill Gates lives in a big house.

In theory, a world in which every individual was educated, healthy, and productive would be a world in which every person lived comfortably. Perhaps we will never cure the world of the assorted physical and mental illnesses that prevent some individuals from reaching their full potential. But that is biology, not economics. Economics tells us that there is no theoretical limit to how well we can live or how widely our wealth can be spread.

The way to induce people to do anything is to pay them a lot.

If everyone has a Harvard degree, who hauls away the sludge?.

The sludge hauler does. And he or she, incidentally, would be one of the best-paid workers in town. If the economy depends on hauling this stuff away, and no machine can do the task, then the community would have to induce someone to do the work. The way to induce people to do anything is to pay them a lot. The wage for hauling sludge would get bid up to the point that some individual—a doctor, or an engineer, or a writer—would be willing to leave a more pleasant job to haul sludge. Thus, a world rich in human capital may still have unpleasant tasks—proctologist springs to mind—but no one has to be poor.

Conversely, many people may accept less money to do particularly enjoyable work—teaching college students comes to mind (especially with the summer off).

A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

If the sultan of Brunei stuffed $1 billion under his mattress in 1970, it would be worth only $180 million today.

When economists slap fancy equations on the chalkboard, the symbol for the interest rate is r, not i. Why? Because the interest rate is considered to be the rental rate—r—on capital. And that is the most intuitive way to think about what is going on.

Harvard buys stocks and bonds, invests in venture capital funds, and otherwise puts $25 billion in the hands of people and institutions around the globe who can do productive things with it. From 1995 to 2005, the endowment earned an average 16 percent annual return, which is a lot more productive for the university than leaving the cash lying around campus. (Harvard also managed to lose 30 percent of its endowment during the financial crisis, so we’ll come back to the Harvard endowment when we talk about “risk and reward.”).

Shakespeare may have admonished us to be neither borrowers nor lenders; the fact is that most of us will be both at some point.

Meanwhile, big purchasers of commodities can benefit from being on the other side of the trade. Airlines use futures contracts to lock in a predictable price for jet fuel. Fast-food restaurants can enter into futures contracts for ground beef, pork bellies (most of which are made into bacon), and even cheddar cheese.

If hurricanes did relatively little damage that year, then the bondholders got their principal back plus nearly 12 percent in interest—a very nice return for a bond.

A credit default swap is really just an insurance policy on whether or not some third party will pay back its debts.

However, that same market also allows the rest of us to bet on whether or not your brother-in-law will pay back the loan. That’s not hedging a bet; that’s speculation. So for any single debt, there may be hundreds or thousands of contracts tied to whether or not it gets repaid.

If you play blackjack long enough—at least without counting cards—it is a mathematical certainty that you will go broke.

A college degree is an excellent investment, but it is not something that can be repossessed in the event of default.

If assets are priced efficiently, then a monkey throwing darts at the stock pages should choose a porfolio that will perform as well, on average, as the portfolios picked by the Wall Street stars.

There is an old joke about two economists walking down the street. One of them sees a $100 bill lying in the street and points it out to his friend. “Is that a $100 bill lying in the gutter?” he asks. “No,” his friend replies. “If it were a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up already.” So they walk on by.

There is even a new field, neuroeconomics, that combines economics, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology to explore the role that biology plays in our decision making. One of the most bizarre and intriguing findings is that people with brain damage may be particularly good investors. Why? Because damage to certain parts of the brain can impair the emotional responses that cause the rest of us to do foolish things. A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and the University of Iowa conducted an experiment that compared the investment decisions made by fifteen patients with damage to the areas of the brain that control emotions (but with intact logic and cognitive functions) to the investment decisions made by a control group.

The impaired investors took more risks when there were high potential payoffs and got less emotional when they made losses.

Indexing is to investing what regular exercise and a low-fat diet are to losing weight: a very good starting point.

But you’ve got to have the spare capital first, and the only way to generate spare capital is to spend less than you earn—i.e., save.

The more you save, and the sooner you begin saving it, the more rent you can command from the financial markets.

The flip side, of course, is that if you are spending more cash than you earn, then you will have to “rent” the difference somewhere.

The cost of living better in the present is living less well in the future.

The first step is far more simple: Save early, save often, and pay off the credit cards.

The beauty of running a casino is that the numbers are stacked in your favor. If you are willing to wait long enough—and pose happily for photos as you give a giant check to the occasional big winner—then you will get rich.

And I’m positive that Americans will not have become thin and healthy by eating only grapefruit and ice cream.

Of course, neither scientists nor environmentalists are convinced that ethanol is such a great thing.

Found that ethanol had little effect on either the environment or our dependence on foreign oil.

The ethanol subsidy had, however, cost the Treasury $7.1 billion in forgone tax revenues.

Worse, ethanol may actually make some kinds of air pollution worse. It evaporates faster than pure gasoline, contributing to ozone problems in hot temperatures. A 2006 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that ethanol does reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent relative to gasoline, but it calculated that devoting the entire U.S. corn crop to make ethanol would replace only a small fraction of American gasoline consumption. Corn farming also contributes to environmental degradation due to runoff from fertilizer and pesticides.

“Regardless of whether ethanol is a great fuel for cars, it certainly works wonders in Iowa campaigns.”.

The ethanol tax subsidy increases the demand for corn, which puts money in farmers’ pockets. Just before the Iowa caucuses, corn farmer Marvin Flier told the Times, “Sometimes I think [the candidates] just come out and pander to us,” he said. Then he added, “Of course, that may not be the worst thing.” The National Corn Growers Association figures that the ethanol program increases the demand for corn, which adds 30 cents to the price of every bushel sold.

He realized that ethanol is crucial to Iowa voters, and Iowa is crucial to the presidential race.

He realized that ethanol is crucial to Iowa voters, and Iowa is crucial to the presidential race. Since then, every mainstream presidential candidate has supported the ethanol subsidy, except one: John McCain.

While Senator McCain’s “straight talk” is admirable, let us remind ourselves of one important detail: John McCain is not currently president of the United States. That would be Barack Obama—an ethanol subsidy supporter. Ethanol is not.

While Senator McCain’s “straight talk” is admirable, let us remind ourselves of one important detail: John McCain is not currently president of the United States. That would be Barack Obama—an ethanol subsidy supporter.

Think about ethanol again. The benefits of that $7 billion tax subsidy are bestowed on a small group of farmers, making it quite lucrative for each one.

The opposite would be true with my plan to have left-handed voters pay subsidies to right-handed voters.

If the government has to support the price of milk, the real problem is that there are too many dairy farmers.

The teachers’ unions, one of the most potent political forces in America, always support reforms that require more rigorous training and testing for teachers. Read the fine print, though. Almost without exception, these laws exempt current teachers from whatever new requirement is being imposed.

Almost without exception, these laws exempt current teachers from whatever new requirement is being imposed. In other words, individuals who would like to become teachers have to take additional classes or pass new exams; existing teachers do not.

(1) Good teachers matter. Students assigned to the best quarter of teachers ended up 10 percentile points ahead of students given the worst quarter of teachers (controlling for the students’ initial level of achievement); and (2) certification doesn’t matter.

The best predictor of whether or not a profession is licensed in Illinois is the size and budget of its professional association.

The individuals standing in capitalism’s path of progress—or destruction, from their standpoint—will use every tool they have to avoid it, including politics.

Consider that at the beginning of the fifteenth century, China was far more technologically advanced than the West. China had a superior knowledge of science, farming, engineering, even veterinary medicine. The Chinese were casting iron in 200 B.C., some fifteen hundred years before the Europeans. Yet the Industrial Revolution took place in Europe while Chinese civilization languished. Why? One historical interpretation posits that the Chinese elites valued stability more than progress. As a result, leaders blocked the kinds of wrenching societal changes that made the Industrial Revolution possible. In the fifteenth century, for example, China’s rulers banned long-sea-voyage trade ventures, choking off trade as well as the economic development, discovery, and social change that come with them.

“Where you stand depends on where you sit.”.

Earmarks are the mechanism by which members of Congress insert pork into bills; an earmark directs federal money to a specific project in a member’s district and is therefore insulated from any formal review as to whether the project makes sense or not.

The democratic process will always favor small, well-organized groups at the expense of large, diffuse groups.

It’s not just how many people care one way or the other; it’s how much they care.

Two percent who care deeply about something are a more potent political force than the 98 percent who feel the opposite but aren’t motivated enough to do anything about it.

“And that is: I don’t want to tell you something that’s going to make you not like me. If I had a choice between getting a round of applause by delivering a twenty-six-second applause line and getting a round of boos by telling you the truth, I’d rather get the round of applause.”.

GDP, which represents the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.

It means simply that we as a country produced 2.3 percent more goods and services than we did the year before.

First, what we care about is real GDP, which means that the figure has been adjusted to account for inflation. In contrast, nominal figures have not been adjusted for inflation. If nominal GDP climbs 10 percent in 2012 but inflation is also 10 percent, then we haven’t actually produced more of anything.

It’s the economic equivalent of swapping a $10 bill for ten $1 bills—it looks good in your wallet, but you’re not any richer.

For now, suffice it to say that our standard of living depends on the quantity of goods and services we take home with us, not on the price that shows up at the register.

Second, we care about GDP per capita, which is a nation’s GDP divided by its population. Again, this adjustment is necessary to prevent wildly misleading conclusions. India has a GDP of $3.3 trillion while Israel has a GDP of $201 billion. Which is the richer country? Israel by far. India has more than a billion people while Israel has only seven million; GDP per capita in Israel is $28,300 compared to only $2,900 in India. Similarly, if a country’s economy grows 3 percent in a given year but the population grows 5 percent, then GDP per capita will fall. The country is producing more goods and services, but not enough more to keep up with a population that is growing faster.

In other words, the average American is five.

In other words, the average American is five times as rich as he or she would have been in 1940.

“Making money takes time, so when we shop, we’re really spending time. The real cost of living isn’t measured in dollars and cents but in the hours and minutes we must work to live.”1 So here goes: A pair of stockings cost 25 cents.

Other economists have concluded that the growth rate of GDP per capita in Europe between 500 and 1500 was essentially zero.2 They don’t call it the Dark Ages for nothing.

GDP does not count any economic activity that is not paid for, such as work done in the home. If you cook dinner, take care of the kids, and tidy up around the house, none of that counts toward the nation’s official output. However, if you order out food, drop your kids off at a child care center, and hire a cleaning lady, all of that does. Nor does GDP account for environmental degradation; if a company clear-cuts a virgin forest to make paper, the value of the paper shows up in the GDP figures without any.

If a small minority of a country’s population grow fabulously rich while most citizens are getting steadily poorer, per capita GDP growth could still look impressive.

Human Development Index (HDI) as a broader indicator of national economic health. The HDI uses GDP as one of its components but also adds measures of life expectancy, literacy, and educational attainment.

HDI is a good tool for assessing progress in developing countries; it tells us less about overall well-being in rich countries where life expectancy, literacy, and educational attainment are already relatively high.

Similarly, growing richer must make us better off because we can do and have more of the things that we enjoy. Yet survey results tell us something different. Richer may not be happier. Remember that robust growth of the 1990s? It didn’t seem to do much good for our psyches. In fact, the period of rising real incomes from 1970 to 1999 coincided with a decrease in those who described themselves as “very happy” from 36 percent to 29 percent.5 Economists are belatedly beginning to probe this phenomenon, albeit in their own perversely quantitative way. For example, David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald, economists at Dartmouth College and the University of Warwick, respectively, found that a lasting marriage is worth $100,000 a year, since married people report being as happy, on average, as divorced (and not remarried) individuals who have incomes that are $100,000 higher. So, before you go to bed tonight, be sure to tell your spouse that you would not give.

Any measure of economic progress depends on how you define progress.

All else equal, it is better for a nation to produce more goods and services than fewer. When GDP turns negative, the damage is real: jobs lost, businesses closed, productive capacity turned idle.

My thrift—a decision to curtail my advertising budget or to buy a car next year instead of this year—may cost you your job, which will in turn hurt my business! Indeed, if we all believe the economy is likely to get worse, then it will get worse.

Indeed, if we all believe the economy is likely to get worse, then it will get worse. And if we all believe it will get better, then it will get better. Our behavior—to spend or not to spend—is conditioned on our expectations, and those expectations can quickly become self-fulfilling.

The general rule of thumb, based on research done by economist Arthur Okun and known thereafter as Okun’s law, is that GDP growth of 3 percent a year will leave the unemployment rate unchanged.

Thus, GDP growth of 4 percent would lower unemployment by half a percentage point, and GDP growth of only 2 percent would cause unemployment to rise by half a percentage point.

The concept is simple enough; a budget deficit occurs when the government spends more than it collects in revenues and a surplus is the opposite.

When that tap is open wide, interest rates fall and we spend more freely on things that require borrowed money—everything from new cars to new manufacturing plants.

When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power. Paul Krugman once wrote,.

When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power. Paul Krugman once wrote, “If you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.” The same is now true of Ben Bernanke.

Robert Mundell, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics, has argued that bungled monetary policy in the 1920s and 1930s caused chronic deflation that destabilized the world. He has argued, “Had the price of gold been raised in the late 1920s, or, alternatively, had the major central banks pursued policies of price stability instead of adhering to the gold standard, there would have been no Great Depression, no Nazi revolution, and no World War II.”.

If we begin to spend more freely when rates are cut from 7 percent to 5 percent, why stop there? If there are still people without jobs and others without new cars, then let’s press on to 3 percent, or even 1 percent. New money for everyone! Sadly, there are limits to how fast any economy can grow. If low interest rates, or “easy money,” causes consumers to demand 5 percent more new PT Cruisers than they purchased last year, then Chrysler must expand production by 5 percent. That means hiring more workers and buying more steel, glass, electrical components, etc. At some point, it becomes difficult or impossible for Chrysler to find these new inputs, particularly qualified workers. At that point, the company simply cannot make enough PT Cruisers to satisfy consumer demand; instead, the company begins to raise prices. Meanwhile, autoworkers recognize that Chrysler is desperate for labor, and the union demands higher wages.

In short, an “easy money” policy at the Fed can cause consumers to demand more than the economy can produce. The only way to ration that excess demand is with higher prices. The result is inflation.

The first is the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow funds directly from the Federal Reserve.

The relationship between the discount rate and the cost of borrowing at Citibank is straightforward; when the discount rate falls, banks can borrow more cheaply from the Fed and therefore lend more cheaply to their customers.

Borrowing directly from the Fed carries a certain stigma; it implies that a bank was not able to raise funds privately. Thus, turning to the Fed for a loan is similar to borrowing from your parents after about age twenty-five: You’ll get the money, but it’s better to look somewhere else first.

The second important tool in the Fed’s money supply kit is the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge other banks for short-term loans.

Banks hold bonds for the same reason individual investors do; bonds are a safe place to park funds that aren’t needed for something else. Specifically, banks buy bonds with depositors’ funds that are not being loaned out.

Think of the Fed as always driving in unfamiliar terrain with a map that’s at least ten years out of date.

We were speeding even though the gauges we’re used to looking at said we weren’t.

To economists, money is quite distinct from wealth. Wealth consists of all things that have value—houses, cars, commodities, human capital.

Money, a tiny subset of that wealth, is merely a medium of exchange, something that facilitates trade and commerce.

(The word “salary” comes from the wages paid to Roman soldiers, who were paid in sacks of sal—salt.).

(Imagine life without a unit of account: The Gap is selling jeans for three chickens a pair while Tommy Hilfiger has similar pants on sale for eleven beaver pelts. Which pants cost more?).

Cigarettes long served as the medium of exchange in prisons, where cash is banned.

The basic idea did not change. Whether money was public or private, paper currency derived its value from the fact that it could be redeemed for a set quantity of gold or silver, either from a bank or from the government. Then something strange happened. In 1971, the United States permanently went off the gold standard. At that point, every paper dollar became redeemable for…nothing.

Examine that wad of $100 bills in your wallet. (If necessary, $1 bills can be substituted instead.) Those bills are just paper. You can’t eat them, you can’t drink them, you can’t smoke them, and, most important, you can’t take them to the government and demand anything in return. They have no intrinsic value. And that is true of nearly all the world’s currencies. Left alone on a deserted island with $100 million, you would quickly perish. On the other hand, life would be good if you were rescued and could take the cash with you. Therein lies the value of modern currency: It has purchasing power. Dollars have value because people peddling real things—food, books, pedicures—will accept them.

And people peddling real things will accept dollars because they are confident that other people peddling other real things will accept them, too. A dollar is a piece of paper whose value derives solely from our confidence that we will be able to use it to buy something we need in the future.

To give you some sense of how modern money is a confidence game, consider a bizarre phenomenon in India. Most Indians involved in commerce—shopkeepers, taxi drivers, etc.—will not accept a torn, crumpled, or overly soiled rupee note. Since other Indians know that many of their countrymen will not accept torn notes, they will not accept them either. Finally, when tourists arrive in the country, they quickly learn to accept only intact bills, lest they be stuck with the torn ones. The whole process is utterly irrational, since the Indian Central Bank considers any note with a serial number—torn, dirty, crumpled, or otherwise—to be legal tender. Any bank will exchange torn rupees for crisp new ones. That doesn’t matter; rational people refuse legal tender because they believe that it might not be accepted by someone else. The whole bizarre phenomenon underscores the fact that our faith in paper currency is predicated on the faith that others place in the same paper.

The new tractor probably wasn’t any more expensive than the old tractor in real terms, meaning that he had to do the same amount of work, or less, in order to buy it. The sticker price on his tractor had gone up, but so had the prices at which he could sell his crops and cattle.

The method of determining this figure is surprisingly low-tech; government officials periodically check the prices of thousands and thousands of goods—clothes, food, fuel, entertainment, housing—and then compile them into a number that reflects how the prices of a basket of goods purchased by the average consumer has changed.

The most instructive way to think about inflation is not that prices are going up, but rather that the purchasing power of the dollar is going down.

Indeed, the mark lost so much value that it became cheaper for households to burn them than to use them to buy firewood.

Even today, it is not possible to get a thirty-year fixed mortgage in much of Latin America because of fears that inflation will come roaring back.

Suppose that American incomes rose 5 percent last year. That is a meaningless figure until we know the inflation rate. If prices rose by 7 percent, then we have actually become worse off.

Comparing gross receipts in 2010 to gross receipts in 1970 or 1950 is a silly exercise unless they are adjusted for inflation. A ticket to Gone with the Wind cost 19 cents. A ticket to Dude, Where’s My Car? cost $10. Of course the gross receipts are going to look big by comparison.

Inflation also redistributes wealth arbitrarily. Suppose I borrow $1,000 from you and promise to pay back the loan, plus interest of $100, next year. That seems a fair arrangement for both of us. Now suppose that a wildly irresponsible central banker allows inflation to explode to 100 percent a year. The $1,100 that I pay back to you next year will be worth much less than either of us had expected; its purchasing power will be cut in half. In real terms, I will borrow $1,100 from you and pay back $550. Unexpected bouts of inflation are good for debtors and bad for lenders—a crucial point that we will come back.

The nominal rate is used to calculate what you have to pay back; it’s the number you see posted on the bank window or on the front page of a loan document.

The real interest rate is the nominal rate minus the rate of inflation.

Suppose you buy a stock and sell it a year later, earning a 10 percent return. If the inflation rate was also 10 percent over that period, then you have not actually made any money.

Inflation is bad; deflation, or steadily falling prices, is much worse.

If prices are falling, then borrowing $100 today and paying back $100 next year is not costless.

To hark back to the politics of organized interests covered in Chapter 8, one theory for why Japanese officials have not done more to fight falling prices is that Japan’s aging population, many of whom live on fixed incomes or savings, see deflation as a good thing despite its dire consequences for the economy as a whole.

In 1992, George Soros made nearly $1 billion in a single day for the investment funds he managed. Most people need several weeks to make a billion dollars, or even a month.

Currencies are no different than any other good; the exchange rate, or the “price” of one currency relative to another,.

Currencies are no different than any other good; the exchange rate, or the “price” of one currency relative to another, is determined by supply relative to demand.

(1) The government could use its reserves of other foreign currencies to buy pounds—directly boosting demand for the currency; or (2) the government could use monetary policy to raise real interest rates, which, all else equal, makes British bonds (and the pounds necessary to buy them) more lucrative to global investors and attracts capital (or keeps it from leaving).

The British economy was in bad shape; raising interest rates during a recession slows the economy even further, which makes for bad economics and even worse politics.

National borders are political demarcations, not economic ones.

You buy your Toyota in dollars. Toyota must pay its Japanese workers and executives in yen. And that is where things begin to get interesting.

The American dollar is just a piece of paper. It is not backed by gold, or rice, or tennis balls, or anything else with intrinsic value. The Japanese yen is exactly the same. So are the euro, the peso, the rupee, and every other modern currency. When individuals and firms begin trading across national borders, currencies must be exchanged at some rate. If the American dollar is just a piece of paper, and the Japanese yen is just a piece of paper, then how much American paper should we swap for Japanese paper?.

A Japanese yen has value because it can be used to purchase things; a dollar has value for the same reason. So, in theory, we ought to be willing to exchange $1 for however many yen or pesos or rubles would purchase roughly the same amount of stuff in the relevant country.

If a bundle of everyday goods costs $25 in the United States, and a comparable bundle of goods costs 750 rubles in Russia, then we would expect $25 to be worth roughly 750 rubles (and $1 should be worth roughly 30 rubles). This is the theory of purchasing power parity, or PPP.

By the same logic, if the value of the ruble is losing 10 percent of its purchasing power within Russia every year while the U.S. dollar is holding its value, we would expect the ruble to lose value relative to the U.S. dollar (or depreciate) at the same rate. This isn’t advanced math; if one currency buys less stuff than it used to, then anyone trading for that currency is going to demand more of it to compensate for the diminished purchasing power.*.

If $100 can be exchanged for enough pesos to buy significantly more stuff in Mexico, who would want the $100? Many of us would trade our dollars for pesos so that we could buy extra goods and services in Mexico and live better.

Or rental housing. In a modern economy, more than three-quarters of goods and services are nontradable.

Using the same Mumbai meal example, you should recognize why PPP is the most accurate mechanism for comparing incomes across countries. At official exchange rates, a Mumbai salary may look very low when converted to dollars, but because many nontradable goods and services are much less expensive in Mumbai than in the United States, a seemingly low salary may buy a much higher standard of living than the official exchange rate would suggest.

Currencies that buy more than PPP would predict are said to be “overvalued” currencies that buy less are “undervalued.”.

Of late, the value of the renminbi relative to the dollar has been a significant source of tension between the United States and China—a topic we’ll come back to later in this chapter.

The U.S. dollar is weak, meaning that it can be exchanged for fewer yen or euros than normal, then foreign goods become more expensive.

At the same time, a weak dollar makes American goods less expensive for the rest of the world.

An undervalued currency promotes exports (and therefore the industries that produce them). At the same time, a cheap currency raises the costs of imports, which is bad for consumers.

A government that deliberately keeps its currency undervalued is essentially taxing consumers of imports and subsidizing producers of exports.

A country with a booming economy will often have a currency that is appreciating. Strong growth presents investment opportunities that attract capital from.

In order to defend the nation’s gold reserves, the central bank must raise interest rates—even though a weakening economy needs the opposite.

“In the early 1930s this mentality led governments to raise interest rates and slash spending, despite mass unemployment, in an attempt to defend their gold reserves. And even when countries went off gold, the prevailing mentality made them reluctant to cut rates and create jobs.”.

Countries pledge to maintain their exchange rates at some predetermined rate with a group of other countries—such as the nations of Europe.

A central bank raises or lowers interest rates by making its currency more or less scarce.

Countries that share a currency with other nations, such as the European countries that adopted the euro, must give up control over their own monetary policy.

Even little kids trading snacks in the lunchroom recognize that what you give up should be worth what you get back.

Any country that is consuming more than it produces must by definition be running a current account deficit because (1) the stuff you are consuming beyond what you produce must come from somewhere else in the world; and (2) you can’t trade goods and services for the extra stuff that you’re getting from the rest of the world because you’ve consumed everything you have.

There are only four broad things that Farmer America can do with what he grows: He can eat it (consumption); he can plant it for next year’s crop (investment); he can send it to the government to pay for services (government spending); or he can trade it for other stuff (exports traded for imports). That’s it.

So far, the United States owes China about a trillion dollars.

The United States gets loans from China to buy its exports.

“You could say—and I would—that globalization, driven not by human goodness but by the profit motive, has done far more good for far more people than all the foreign aid and soft loans ever provided by well-intentioned governments and international agencies.”.

“But in saying this, I know from experience that I have guaranteed myself a barrage of hate mail.”.

Having made that case in many different venues, now I get hate mail, too. Sometimes it’s actually kind of clever. My favorite is an e-mail that came in response to a column arguing that a richer, rapidly growing India is good for the United States. After the usual introduction arguing that my job should be outsourced to some low wage country as soon as possible, the e-mail concluded, “Why don’t you and Tom Friedman [author of the pro-globalization book The World Is Flat] get a room together? The world isn’t flat, it’s just your head!” Others tend to be less subtle, such as the e-mail with the subject line: YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Yes, that is the exact number of exclamation points.).

Abraham Lincoln was once advised to buy cheap iron rails from Britain to finish the transcontinental railroad. He replied, “It seems to me that if we buy the rails from England, then we’ve got the rails and they’ve got the money. But if we build the rails here, we’ve got our rails and we’ve got our money.”4 To understand the benefits of trade, we must find the fallacy in Mr. Lincoln’s economics. Let me paraphrase his point and see if the logical flaw becomes clear: If I buy meat from the butcher, then I get the meat and he gets my money. But if I raise a cow in my backyard for three years and slaughter it myself, then I’ve got the meat and I’ve got my money. Why don’t I keep a cow in my backyard?.

We trade with others because it frees up time and resources to do things that we are better at.

Saudi Arabia can produce oil more cheaply than the United States can. In turn, the United States can produce corn and soybeans more cheaply than Saudi Arabia. The corn-for-oil trade is an example of absolute advantage. When different countries are better at producing different things, they can both consume more by specializing at what they do best and then trading. People in Seattle should not grow their own rice. Instead, they should build airplanes (Boeing), write software (Microsoft), and sell books (Amazon)—and leave the rice-growing to farmers in Thailand or Indonesia. Meanwhile, those farmers can enjoy the benefits of Microsoft Word even though they do not have the technology or skills necessary to produce such software. Countries, like individuals, have different natural advantages. It does not make any more sense for Saudi Arabia to grow vegetables that it.

Workers in Bangladesh do not have to be better than American workers at producing anything for there to be gains from trade. Rather, they provide goods to us so that we can spend our time specializing at whatever we do best. Here is an example. Many engineers live in Seattle. These men and women have doctorates in mechanical engineering and probably know more about manufacturing shoes and shirts than nearly anyone in Bangladesh. So why would we buy imported shirts and shoes made by poorly educated workers in Bangladesh? Because our Seattle engineers also know how to design and manufacture commercial airplanes. Indeed, that is what they do best, meaning that making jets creates the most value for their time. Importing shirts from Bangladesh frees them up to do this, and the world is better off for it. Productivity is what makes us rich. Specialization is what makes us productive. Trade allows us to specialize.

Mark Twain anticipated the fundamental dilemma: “I’m all for progress; it’s change I don’t like.”.

“Globalization disrupts everything, everywhere. It disrupts established patterns of life—between husband and wife, parents and children; between men and women, young and old; between boss and worker, governor and governed.”.

Can the antiglobalization protesters explain how poor countries will get richer if they trade less with rest of the world—like Gaza? Cutting off trade leaves a country poorer and less productive—which is why we tend to do it to our enemies.

Cheaper goods have the same impact on our lives as higher incomes.

So it is in this case. Representatives from developing nations were the ones who complained most bitterly about the disruption of the WTO talks in Seattle. Some believed.

Most famously, cheap exports were the path to prosperity for the Asian “tigers”—Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (and for Japan before that).

India was strikingly insular during the four decades after achieving independence from Britain in 1947; it was one of the world’s great economic underachievers during that stretch.

Is there an example in modern history of a single country successfully developing without trading and integrating with the global economy?.

“The Coalition to Keep the World’s Poor People Poor.”.

By global standards, poor does not mean settling for a Ford Fiesta when you really wanted the BMW. Poor is watching your children die of malaria because you could not afford a $5 mosquito net.

Yet inadequate access to safe drinking water—a problem easily cured by rising living standards—kills two million people a year and makes another half billion seriously ill. Is global warming a serious problem? Yes. Would it be your primary concern if children in your town routinely died from diarrhea? No. The first fallacy related to trade and the environment is that poor countries should be held to the same environmental standards as the developed world.

I remember the first day of an environmental economics course when visiting professor Paul Portney, former head of Resources for the Future, pointed out that the very act of staying alive requires that we produce waste.

The case for keeping people poor because it’s good for the planet is economically and morally bankrupt.

Anyone who is not a socialist before he is thirty has no heart; anyone who is still a socialist after he is thirty has no head.

At a time when we can split the atom, land on the moon, and decode the human genome, why do 2 billion people live on less than $2 a day?2.

The relationship between government institutions and economic growth prompted a clever and intriguing study. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson hypothesized that the economic success of developing countries that were formerly colonized has been affected by the quality of the institutions that their colonizers left behind.6 The European powers adopted different colonization policies in different parts of the world, depending on how hospitable the area was to settlement. In places where Europeans could settle without serious hardship, such as the United States, the colonizers created institutions that have had a positive and long-lasting effect on economic growth. In places where Europeans could not easily settle because of a high mortality rate from disease, such as the Congo, the colonizers simply focused on taking as much wealth home as quickly as possible, creating what the authors refer to as “extractive states.”.

The answer, according to Mr. Sachs, is that high temperatures and heavy rainfall are bad for food production and conducive to the spread of disease.

Because cold winters control mosquitoes—not because scientists have beaten the disease.

The sad fact is that scientists, like bank robbers, go where the money is. Pharmaceutical companies earn profits by developing blockbuster drugs for consumers in the developed world. Of the 1,233 new medicines granted patents between 1975 and 1997, only thirteen were for tropical diseases.

Strategies such as “self-sufficiency” and “state leadership” were hallmarks of the postcolonial regimes, such as India and much of Africa.

Natural resources matter less than you would think. Israel, which has no oil to speak of, is a far richer country than nearly all of its Middle Eastern neighbors that have large petroleum reserves. Israeli GDP per capita is $28,300 compared to $20,500 for Saudi Arabia and $12,800 for Iran.

Economists believe that a rich endowment of natural resources may actually be a detriment to development.

Meanwhile, demand for a nation’s currency rises as the rest of the world begins to buy its diamonds or bauxite or oil or natural gas. That will cause the currency to appreciate, which, we now know, makes the country’s other exports, such as manufactured goods, more expensive.

He writes, “[Famines] have never materialized in any country that is independent, that goes to elections regularly, that has opposition parties to voice criticisms and that permits newspapers to report freely and question the wisdom of government policies without extensive censorship.”27 China had the largest recorded famine in history; thirty million people died as the result of the failed Great Leap Forward in 1958–1961. India has not had a famine since independence in 1947.

A peasant discovers that many of his chickens are dying, so he seeks advice from a priest. The priest recommends that the peasant say prayers for his chickens, but the chickens continue to die. The priest then recommends music for the chicken coop, but the deaths continue unabated. Pondering again, the priest recommends repainting the chicken coop in bright colors. Finally, all the chickens die. “What a shame,” the priest tells the peasant, “I had so many more good ideas.”.

“There are no confident assertions here of what works and what doesn’t—and no blueprints for policymakers to adopt. The emphasis is on the need for humility, for policy diversity, for selective and modest reforms, and for experimentation.”.

I realize that pointing out the failure of development aid and then arguing for more of it is like Yogi Berra criticizing a restaurant for having bad food and small portions. Still, things become better when there is an overwhelming political will to make them better. That is bigger than economics.

We talk about how important education is, but we make it difficult and time-consuming for smart people to become teachers.


# Flowmeters for Oil & Gas Measurement (Jesse Yoder)

Thermal flowmeters typically inject heat into the flowstream and then measure how quickly this heat dissipates. This value is proportional to mass flow.


# Reservoir simulation models in production forecasting (null)

To represent spatial variation in the reservoir properties, gridblocks must be smaller than the features being represented.

A rule of thumb is that the reservoir simulation cell dimension should be approximately twice that of the geological model cell in X- and Y-directions in areas where hydrocarbons and wells are presented.


# SHELL AND TUBE HEAT EXCHANGERS (null)

Due to the flexibility the designer has to allow for a wide range of pressures and temperatures.

A shell and tube exchanger consists of a number of tubes mounted inside a cylindrical shell.

Two fluids can exchange heat, one fluid flows over the outside of the tubes while the second fluid flows through the tubes.

The fluids can be single or two phase and can flow in a parallel or a cross/counter flow arrangement.

The popularity of shell and tube exchangers has resulted in a standard nomenclature being developed for their designation and use by the Tubular Exchanger Manufactures Association (TEMA).

The first letter describes the front header type, the second letter the shell type and the third letter the rear header type.


# HEAT EXCHANGERS (null)

This is less efficient than countercurrent flow but does provide more uniform wall temperatures.

Crossflow heat exchangers are intermediate in efficiency between countercurrent flow and parallel flow exchangers. In these units, the streams flow at right angles.

Indirect contact heat exchangers keep the fluids exchanging heat separate by the use of tubes or plates etc.

Consists of a number of tubes mounted inside a cylindrical shell.

One fluid flows over the outside of the tubes while the second fluid flows through the tubes.

The fluids can be single or two phase and can flow in a parallel or a cross/counter flow arrangement.

Front end–this is where the fluid enters the tubeside of the exchanger.

Rear end–this is where the tubeside fluid leaves the exchanger or where it is returned to the front header in.

Exchangers with multiple tubeside passes.

Tube bundle–this comprises of the tubes, tube sheets, baffles and tie rods etc. to hold the bundle together.

Shell—this contains the tube bundle.

Agitated vessels are mainly used to heat viscous fluids.


# Shell and tube heat exchanger (Wikipedia Contributors)

One fluid runs through the tubes, and another fluid flows over the tubes (through the shell) to transfer heat between the two fluids. The set of tubes is called a tube bundle, and may be composed of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned,.

# My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry (Fredrik Backman)

“Changing memories is a good superpower, I suppose.” Granny.

“Changing memories is a good superpower, I suppose.”.

“If you can’t get rid of the bad, you have to top it up with more goody stuff.”.

“We’re knights of the kingdom of Miamas, we have to do our duty.” Because all seven-year-olds deserve superheroes. And anyone who doesn’t agree needs their head examined.

Elsa still heard their argument about the difference between “sexual harassment” and “basic appreciation of a perfectly splendid ass.”.

Granny has had nine different nurses since she was admitted. Seven of these she refused to cooperate with, and two refused to cooperate with her, one of them because Granny said he had a “nice ass.” Granny insists it was a compliment to his ass, not to him, and he shouldn’t make such a fuss about it. Then Mum told Elsa to put on her headphones, but Elsa still heard their argument about the difference between “sexual harassment” and “basic appreciation of a perfectly splendid ass.”.

Elsa is the sort of child who learned early in life that it’s easier to make your way if you get to choose your own soundtrack.

She sits reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on the iPad for about the twelfth time. It’s the Harry Potter book she likes the least; that’s why she’s read it so few times.

She just wants Elsa to know she’s on Elsa’s side, no matter what. Because that’s what you do when you’re a granny and your grandchild’s parents get divorced and find themselves new partners and suddenly tell your grandchild there’s a half sibling on its way.

Granny says that her skirt is too well-ironed and “if you were the cloth hanging off that woman you’d be terrified of getting yourself creased.”.

His shoes have soles as thin as greaseproof paper because he doesn’t lift his feet when he walks. Granny says he has the lowest center of gravity in the entire bloody universe.

Britt-Marie nods her understanding of the situation and brushes some invisible dust off her skirt. There is always a bit of invisible dust on Britt-Marie’s skirt, which only Britt-Marie can see, and which she absolutely must brush.

Britt-Marie nods her understanding of the situation and brushes some invisible dust off her skirt. There is always a bit of invisible dust on Britt-Marie’s skirt, which only Britt-Marie can see, and which she absolutely must brush off.

“Hope we didn’t cause you any inconvenience by being here on time.”.

Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild’s ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact.

Granny always says one should know one’s enemies better than oneself.

Granny was not the sort of person you had to call.

That’s why Elsa always tears up the notes she gets in her locker. The notes about how she is ugly. That she’s disgusting. That they’re going to kill her. Elsa rips them into such tiny pieces that they can hardly be seen and then throws them into different wastepaper bins all over the school. It’s an act of mercy to those who wrote the notes, because Granny would have beaten them to death if she’d found out.

And then one of the boys behind her got annoyed because he was going for that. And then there was an argument. “You can’t take Spider-Man!” shouted the boy. And Elsa said, “Pity, because I just did!” And then the boy said, “It’s a pity for YOU, yeah!” And then Elsa snorted in English. “Sure!” Because that is Elsa’s favorite word in English. And then the boy shouted that Elsa couldn’t be Spider-Man because “only boys can be Spider-Man!” And then Elsa told him he could be Spider-Man’s girlfriend. And then he pushed Elsa into a radiator. And then Elsa hit him with a book. Elsa still thinks he should thank her for it, because that’s probably the nearest that boy ever got to a book. But then the teacher came running and put a stop to it all and said that no one could be Spider-Man because Spider-Man only existed in films and so he wasn’t a “literary character.” And then Elsa got possibly a bit disproportionally worked up and asked the teacher if he’d heard of something called Marvel Comics, but the teacher hadn’t. “AND THEY LET YOU TEACH CHILDREN?!” Then Elsa had to sit for ages after the class “having a chat” with the teacher, which was just a lot of teacher-babbling.

“You should choose your battles if you can, but if the battle chooses you then kick the sod in his fuse box!”.

They sit there in the sort of silent eternity that only mothers and daughters can build up between themselves.

Elsa has tried to understand exactly what “irony” means and she’s fairly sure it’s that Dad is never late for anything other than picking up Elsa from school, and Granny was always late for everything except for that one thing.

She hops into the big wardrobe. The darkness inside the wardrobe settles around her, and no one knows she is crying.

“Sometimes the safest place is when you flee to what seems the most dangerous,”.

“Sometimes the safest place is when you flee to what seems the most dangerous,” said Granny, and then she described how the prince rode right into the darkest forest and the shadows stopped, hissing, at the edge. For not even they were sure what might be lurking inside, on the other side of the trees, and nothing scares anyone more than the unknown, which can only be known by reliance on the imagination. “When it comes to terror, reality’s got nothing.

For not even they were sure what might be lurking inside, on the other side of the trees, and nothing scares anyone more than the unknown, which can only be known by reliance on the imagination. “When it comes to terror, reality’s got nothing on the power of the imagination,” Granny said.

“No shit, Sherlock—I wasn’t implying you did it on purpose.” (“No.

“No shit, Sherlock—I wasn’t implying you did it on purpose.” (“No shit, Sherlock” is one of her favorite expressions in English. Her father always says one should not use English expressions if there are perfectly good substitutes in one’s own language, but Elsa actually doesn’t think there is a substitute in this case.).

Elsa heard Mum rebuff Granny by saying, “What do you know about my teenage years? You were never here!” That was the only time Elsa ever heard Mum saying anything to Granny while holding back tears.

“What do you get from someone who has everything?”.

“What do you GIVE to someone who has everything?”.

On her sixth birthday, Granny told her the story of the sea-angel. To teach her that not all monsters are monsters in the beginning, and not all monsters look like monsters. Some carry their monstrosity inside.

Improbable catastrophes produce improbable things in people, improbable sorrow and improbable heroism.

“I’m a doctor, for God’s sake, and ever since I became one I’ve not allowed myself the luxury of choosing whose life I should be saving.”.

“Because when you love someone very much, it’s difficult to learn to share her with someone else.”.

Elsa chooses not to enter into a discussion of whether Mum is being sarcastic or ironic there.

Soup is soup whatever bowl it’s in.”.

“You have standards and I have double standards, and so I win.”.

“You have all these books and not a single Harry Potter? And they let you fix people whose heads are broken?”.

“Never mess with someone who has more spare time than you do,”.

“Never mess with someone who’s perky for her age.”.

Never stole the bags, I just haven’t given them back yet,”.

“I never stole the bags, I just haven’t given them back yet,”.

Because Granny actually liked those newspapers, she used to stuff them into her shoes when it had been raining. But one day when Elsa read on the Internet how many trees it took to make just one edition of a newspaper, she put up “No junk mail ever, thanks!” notices on both Mum’s and Granny’s doors, because Elsa is a big fan of the environment. The newspapers kept coming, and when Elsa called the company they just laughed at her. And they shouldn’t have done that. Because no one laughs at Granny’s grandchild. Granny hated the environment, but she was the kind of person you brought along when you were going to war. So she became a terrorist for Elsa’s sake. Elsa is furious at Granny for that, in fact, because Elsa wants to be furious at Granny. For everything else. For the lies and for abandoning Mum and for dying. But it’s impossible to stay angry at someone who’s prepared to turn terrorist for the sake of her grandchild. And it makes Elsa furious that she can’t be furious.

If you don’t like people, they can’t hurt you.

Elsa shrugs and slams the door in his face. The wurse has reappeared, so she climbs onto its back and peers out of the spyhole to see George lingering there for what must be a minute, looking upset. Elsa hates him for that. Mum always tells Elsa that George just wants her to like him because he cares. As if Elsa doesn’t get that. She knows he cares, and that’s why she can’t like him. Not because she wouldn’t like him if she tried, but rather because she knows she definitely would. Because everyone likes George. It’s his superpower. And she knows that in this case she’ll only be disappointed when Halfie is born and George forgets she exists. It’s better not to like him from the start. If you don’t like people, they can’t hurt you. Almost-eight-year-olds who are often described as “different” learn that very quickly.

Elsa shakes her head and holds the book tightly. “No,” she lies. Because she’s polite enough to know that if someone gives you a book, you owe that person the pretense that you haven’t read it.

The mightiest power of death is not that it can make people die, but that it can make the people left behind want to stop living, she thinks, without remembering where she heard that.

People in the real world always say, when something terrible happens, that the sadness and loss and aching pain of the heart will “lessen as time passes,” but it isn’t true. Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn’t be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us. So in the end we just pack it into bags and find somewhere to leave it.

George used to say that Granny wasn’t a time-optimist, she was a time-atheist, and the only religion she believed in was Do-It-Later-Buddhism.

“All the photos on the ceiling in your grandmother’s bedroom, darling. All the children in the photos. They were the ones who came to the funeral today. They’re grown-up now. They were allowed to grow up because your granny saved their lives. . . .”.

“It’s known as ‘the trolley problem.’ In ethics. I mean, for students. At university. It’s . . . it’s the discussion of whether it’s morally right to sacrifice one person in order to save many others. You can probably read about it on Wikipedia.”.

“Don’t fight with monsters, for you can become one. If you look into the abyss for long enough, the abyss looks into you.” “What are you.

“Don’t fight with monsters, for you can become one. If you look into the abyss for long enough, the abyss looks into you.”.

“Sorry, that’s . . . that was Nietzsche. He was a German philosopher. It’s . . . ah, I’m probably misquoting him. But I think it could mean that if you hate the one who hates, you could risk becoming like the one you hate.”.

Was the cloud animals that saved the Chosen One when the shadows came in secret to the kingdom of Mimovas to kidnap him. For while Miamas is made of fantasy, Mimovas is made of love. Without love there is no music, and without music there is no Mimovas, and the Chosen One was the most beloved.

It was the cloud animals that saved the Chosen One when the shadows came in secret to the kingdom of Mimovas to kidnap him. For while Miamas is made of fantasy, Mimovas is made of love. Without love there is no music, and without music there is no Mimovas, and the Chosen One was the most beloved in the whole kingdom. So if the shadows had taken him, it would eventually have led to the downfall of the Land-of-Almost-Awake. If Mimovas falls then Mirevas falls, and if Mirevas falls then Miamas falls, and if Miamas falls then Miaudacas falls, and if Miaudacas falls then Miploris falls. Because without music there can’t be any dreams, and without dreams there can’t be any fairy tales, and without fairy tales there can’t be any courage, and without courage no one would be able to bear any sorrows, and without music and dreams and fairy tales and courage and sorrow there would only be one kingdom left in the Land-of-Almost-Awake: Mibatalos. But Mibatalos can’t live alone, because the warriors there would be worthless without the other kingdoms, because they’d no longer have anything to fight for.

The one where Harry says that he and his friends have one advantage in the approaching war with Voldemort, because they have one thing that Voldemort doesn’t have: “Something worth fighting for.”.

“It’s complicated being a grown-up sometimes, Elsa,” Britt-Marie says evasively. “It’s not, like, easy-peasy being a kid either,” Elsa replies belligerently.

“I want someone to remember I existed. I want someone to know I was here.”.

Because all seven-year-olds deserve superheroes. And whoever disagrees with that needs their head examined.

Correctness! It’s worse than apartheid.


# Flow (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)

What I “discovered” was that happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person.

“Ask yourself whether you are happy,” said J. S. Mill, “and you cease to be so.”.

Meaning:“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”.

Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

However well-intentioned, books cannot give recipes for how to be happy. Because optimal experience depends on the ability to control what happens in consciousness moment by moment, each person has to achieve it on the basis of his own individual efforts and creativity.

However well-intentioned, books cannot give recipes for how to be happy. Because optimal experience depends on the ability to control what happens in consciousness moment by moment, each person has to achieve it on the basis of his own individual efforts and creativity. What a book can do, however, and what this one will try to accomplish, is to present examples of how life can be made more enjoyable, ordered in the framework of a theory, for readers to reflect upon and from which they may then draw their own conclusions.

It is how people respond to stress that determines whether they will profit from misfortune or be miserable.

“No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought.”.

Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to exert over the great forces of the universe.

Each of us has a picture, however vague, of what we would like to accomplish before we die. How close we get to attaining this goal becomes the measure for the quality of our lives. If it remains beyond reach, we grow resentful or resigned; if it is at least in part achieved, we experience a sense of happiness and satisfaction. For the majority of people.

Each of us has a picture, however vague, of what we would like to accomplish before we die. How close we get to attaining this goal becomes the measure for the quality of our lives. If it remains beyond reach, we grow resentful or resigned; if it is at least in part achieved, we experience a sense of happiness and satisfaction.

When Cyrus the Great had ten thousand cooks prepare new dishes for his table, the rest of Persia had barely enough to eat. These days every household in the “first world” has access to the recipes of the most diverse lands and can duplicate the feasts of past emperors. But does this make us more satisfied?.

In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way.

The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.

Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives. We shall see later how they have managed to reach this state. But before we do so, we need to review some of the devices that have been developed over time as protection against the threat of chaos, and the reasons why such external defenses often do not work.

The unwarranted sense of security sooner or later results in a rude awakening.

When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity.

As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.

The roots of the discontent are internal, and each person must untangle them personally, with his or her own power.

Childhood can be painful, adolescence confusing, but for most people, behind it all there is the expectation that after one grows up, things will get better.

Like waiters in a restaurant starting to place breakfast settings on the surrounding tables while one is still having dinner, these intimations of mortality plainly communicate the message: Your time is up, it’s time to move on.

When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?”.

But inevitably the bathroom mirror shows the first white hairs, and confirms the fact that those extra pounds are not about to leave; inevitably eyesight begins to fail and mysterious pains begin to shoot through the body. Like waiters in a restaurant starting to place breakfast settings on the surrounding tables while one is still having dinner, these intimations of mortality plainly communicate the message: Your time is up, it’s time to move on. When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?”.

As this realization slowly sets in, different people react to it differently. Some try to ignore it, and renew their efforts to acquire more of the things that were supposed to make life good—bigger cars and homes, more power on the job, a more glamorous life-style. They renew their efforts, determined still to achieve the satisfaction that up until then has eluded them. Sometimes this solution works, simply because one is so drawn into the competitive struggle that there is no time to realize that the goal has not come any nearer. But if a person does take the time out to reflect, the disillusionment returns: after each success it becomes clearer that money, power, status, and possessions do not, by themselves, necessarily add one iota to the quality of life.

There are just so many dams about to burst and so little time to tend to them all.

Daunted by the futility of trying to keep up with all the demands they cannot possibly meet, some will just surrender and retire gracefully into relative oblivion. Following Candide’s advice, they will give up on the world and cultivate their little gardens. They might dabble in genteel forms of escape such as developing a harmless hobby or accumulating a collection of abstract paintings or porcelain figurines.

The form in which religions have presented their truths—myths, revelations, holy texts—no longer compels belief in an era of scientific rationality, even though the substance of the truths may have remained unchanged.

But the ostrich’s strategy for avoiding bad news is hardly productive; better to face facts and take care to avoid becoming one of the statistics.

Given that we are who we are, with whatever hang-ups and repressions, what can we do to improve our future?.

We grow up believing that what counts most in our lives is that which will occur in the future.

The “good life” promised as a reward for a lifetime of work and adherence to laws is built on the cravings contained in our genetic programs.

To lure recruits into the Turkish armed forces, the sultans of the sixteenth century promised conscripts the rewards of raping women in the conquered territories; nowadays posters promise young men that if they join the army, they will “see the world.”.

Some people produce more than the usual amount of androgens and therefore become excessively aggressive. Does that mean they should freely express violence?.

In a complex society, many powerful groups are involved in socializing, sometimes to seemingly contradictory goals. On the one hand, official institutions like schools, churches, and banks try to turn us into responsible citizens willing to work hard and save. On the other hand, we are constantly cajoled by merchants, manufacturers, and advertisers to spend our earnings on products that will produce the most profits for them. And, finally, the underground system of forbidden pleasures run by gamblers, pimps, and drug dealers, which is dialectically linked to the official institutions, promises its own rewards of easy dissipation—provided we pay. The messages are very different, but their outcome is essentially the same: they make us dependent on a social system that exploits our energies for its own purposes.

It means that, in addition to or instead of the goals others use to bribe us with, we develop a set of our own.

The most important step in emancipating oneself from social controls is the ability to find rewards in the events of each moment. If a person learns to enjoy and find meaning in the ongoing stream of experience, in the process of living itself, the burden of social controls automatically falls from one’s shoulders.

Power returns to the person when rewards are no longer relegated to outside forces. It is no longer necessary to struggle for goals that always seem to recede into the future, to end each boring day with the hope that tomorrow, perhaps, something good will happen. Instead of forever straining for the tantalizing prize dangled just out of reach, one begins to harvest the genuine rewards of living. But it is not by abandoning ourselves to instinctual desires that we become free of social controls. We must also become independent from the dictates of the body, and learn to take charge of what happens in the mind. Pain and pleasure occur in consciousness and exist only there. As long as we obey the socially conditioned stimulus-response patterns that exploit our biological inclinations, we are controlled from the outside.

“Men are not afraid of things, but of how they view them,” said Epictetus a long time ago. And the great emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote: “If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgment of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.”.

Thus, for instance, a yogi disciplines his mind to ignore pain that ordinary people would have no choice but to let into their awareness; similarly he can ignore the insistent claims of hunger or sexual arousal that most people would be helpless to resist.

Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will.

Without consciousness we would still “know” what is going on, but we would have to react to it in a reflexive, instinctive way. With consciousness, we can deliberately weigh what the senses tell us, and respond accordingly. And we can also invent information that did not exist before: it is because we have consciousness that we can daydream, make up lies, and write beautiful poems and scientific theories.

There is no reason to rule out the possibility that eventually we shall be able to bend spoons with brain waves.

Thus we might think of consciousness as intentionally ordered information.

At this point in our scientific knowledge we are on the verge of being able to estimate how much information the central nervous system is capable of processing. It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information—such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about 1/18 of a second. By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most 126 bits of information per second,.

By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most 126 bits of information per second, or 7,560 per minute, or almost half a million per hour.

For instance, driving down the highway, we pass hundreds of cars without actually being aware of them. Their shape and color might register for a fraction of a second, and then they are immediately forgotten. But occasionally we notice a particular vehicle, perhaps because it is swerving unsteadily between lanes, or because it is moving very slowly, or because of its unusual appearance. The image of the unusual car enters the focus of consciousness, and we become aware of it. In the mind the visual information about the car (e.g., “it is swerving”) gets related to information about other errant cars stored in memory, to determine into which category the present instance fits.

The names we use to describe personality traits—such as extrovert, high achiever, or paranoid—refer to the specific patterns people have used to structure their attention.

And it is an energy under our control, to do with as we please; hence, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience.

We most often associate our self with our body, though sometimes we extend its boundaries to identify it with a car, house, or family.

One of the main forces that affects consciousness adversely is psychic disorder—that is, information that conflicts with existing intentions, or distracts us from carrying them out. We give this condition many names, depending on how we experience it: pain, fear, rage, anxiety, or jealousy.

Some information that conflicts with an individual’s goals appears in consciousness.

The outside event appears in consciousness purely as information, without necessarily having a positive or negative value attached to it.

And if he had had a stronger sense of self-confidence, the temporary setback would not have affected him as much because he would have trusted his ability to overcome it eventually.

These examples illustrate what we mean by optimal experience. They are situations in which attention can be freely invested to achieve a person’s goals, because there is no disorder to straighten out, no threat for the self to defend against.

The “battle” is not really against the self, but against the entropy that brings disorder to consciousness. It is really a battle for the self; it is a struggle for.

The “battle” is not really against the self, but against the entropy that brings disorder to consciousness. It is really a battle for the self; it is a struggle for establishing control over attention.

“[There’s] no place that more draws the best from human beings…[than] a mountaineering situation. Nobody hassles you to put your mind and body under tremendous stress to get to the top…. Your comrades are there, but you all feel the same way anyway, you’re all in it together. Who can you trust more in the twentieth century than these people? People after the same self-discipline as yourself, following the deeper commitment…. A bond like that with other people is in itself an ecstasy.”.

THERE ARE TWO MAIN STRATEGIES we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match our goals. The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better. For instance, feeling secure is an important component of happiness. The sense of security can be improved by buying a gun, installing strong locks on the front door, moving to a safer neighborhood, exerting political pressure on city hall for more police protection, or helping the community to become more conscious of the importance of civil order. All these different responses are aimed at bringing conditions in the environment more in line with our goals. The other method by which we can feel more secure involves modifying what we mean by security. If one does not expect perfect safety, recognizes that risks are inevitable, and succeeds in enjoying a less than ideally predictable world, the threat of insecurity will not have as great a chance of marring happiness.

The waiting rooms of psychiatrists are filled with rich and successful patients who, in their forties or fifties, suddenly wake up to the fact that a plush suburban home, expensive cars, and even an Ivy League education are not enough to bring peace of mind. Yet people keep hoping that changing the external conditions of their lives will provide a solution. If only they could earn more money, be in better physical shape, or have a more understanding partner, they would really have it made. Even though we recognize that material success may not bring happiness, we engage in an endless struggle to reach external goals, expecting that they will improve life.

And the reality is that the quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own.

And the reality is that the quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own. The bottom line is, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us. To improve life one must improve the quality of experience.

This is not to say that money, physical fitness, or fame are irrelevant to happiness. They can be genuine blessings, but only if they help to make us feel better.

Given these observations, instead of worrying about how to make a million dollars or how to win friends and influence people, it seems more beneficial to find out how everyday life can be made more harmonious and more satisfying, and thus achieve by a direct route what cannot be reached through the pursuit of symbolic goals.

Enjoyment is characterized by this forward movement: by a sense of novelty, of accomplishment. Playing a close game of tennis that stretches one’s ability is enjoyable, as is reading a book that reveals things in a new light, as is having a conversation that leads us to express ideas we didn’t know we had. Closing a contested business deal, or any piece of work well done, is enjoyable. None of these experiences may be particularly pleasurable at the time they are taking place, but afterward we think back on them and say, “That really was fun” and wish they would happen again. After an enjoyable event we know that we have changed, that our self has grown: in some respect, we have become more complex as a result of.

But I didn’t know Signor Orsini well enough. He turned purple and with barely contained agitation escorted the customer out of the store: “No, no, signora, I am sorry but I cannot sell you those angels.” To the flabbergasted woman he kept repeating, “I cannot make business with you. You understand?” After the tourist finally left, he calmed down and explained: “If I were starving, I would have taken her money. But since I am not, why should I make a deal that isn’t any fun? I enjoy the clash of wits involved in bargaining, when two persons try to outdo each other with ruses and with eloquence. She didn’t even flinch. She didn’t know any better. She didn’t pay me the respect of assuming that I was going to try to take advantage of her. If I had sold those pieces to that woman at that ridiculous price, I would have felt cheated.” Few people, in southern Italy or elsewhere, have this strange attitude toward business transactions. But then I suspect that they don’t enjoy their work as much as Signor Orsini did, either.

First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing.

Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions.

Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self.

“He who wrestles with us,” wrote Edmund Burke, “strengthens our nerves, and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper.”.

But when beating the opponent takes precedence in the mind over performing as well as possible, enjoyment tends to disappear.

Competition is enjoyable only when it is a means to perfect one’s skills; when it becomes an end in itself, it ceases to be fun.

But it would be a mistake to assume that only art and leisure can provide optimal experiences.

Professor Maier-Leibnitz suffers from an occupational handicap common to academicians: having to sit through endless, often boring conferences.

But how enjoyable an activity is depends ultimately on its complexity. The small automatic games woven into the fabric of everyday life help reduce boredom, but add little to the positive quality of experience. For that one needs to face more demanding challenges, and use higher-level skills.

Unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them.

Described his state of mind while climbing as follows: “It is as if my memory input has been cut off. All I can remember is the last thirty seconds, and all I can think ahead is the next five minutes.”.

A professor of physics who was an avid rock climber described his state of mind while climbing as follows: “It is as if my memory input has been cut off. All I can remember is the last thirty seconds, and all I can think ahead is the next five minutes.”.

As this example illustrates, what people enjoy is not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations.

It is not possible to experience a feeling of control unless one is willing to give up the safety of protective routines. Only when a doubtful outcome is at stake, and one is able to influence that outcome, can a person really know whether she is in control.

Optimal experience is a form of energy, and energy can be used either to help or to destroy. Fire warms or burns; atomic energy can generate electricity or it can obliterate the world. Energy is power, but power is only a means. The goals to which it is applied can make life either richer or more painful.

“If you showed me something I can do that’s as much fun as breaking into a house at night, and lifting the jewelry without waking anyone up, I would do it.”.

“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”.

If mankind had tried to ban fire because it could be used to burn things down, we would not have grown to be very different from the great apes.

And why is it that one person will experience joy even in a concentration camp, while another gets the blahs while vacationing at a fancy resort?.

The roots of the word “compete” are the Latin con petire, which meant “to seek together.”.

The roots of the word “compete” are the Latin con petire, which meant “to seek together.” What each person seeks is to actualize her potential, and this task is made easier when others force us to do our best.

Of course, competition improves experience only as long as attention is focused primarily on the activity itself.

Of course, competition improves experience only as long as attention is focused primarily on the activity itself. If extrinsic goals—such as beating the opponent, wanting to impress an audience, or obtaining a big professional contract—are what one is concerned about, then competition is likely to become a distraction, rather than an incentive to focus consciousness on what is happening.

Any activity that transforms the way we perceive reality is enjoyable, a fact that accounts for the attraction of “consciousness-expanding” drugs of all sorts, from magic mushrooms to alcohol to the current Pandora’s box of hallucinogenic chemicals. But consciousness cannot be expanded; all we can do is shuffle its content, which gives us the impression of having broadened it somehow.

It is not skills we actually have that determine how we feel, but the ones we think we have.

The Ik of Uganda, unable to cope with a deteriorating environment that no longer provides enough food for them to survive, have institutionalized selfishness beyond the wildest dreams of capitalism.

It is in this respect that games provide a compelling analogy to cultures. Both consist of more or less arbitrary goals and rules that allow people to become involved in a process and act with a minimum of doubts and distractions. The difference is mainly one of scale. Cultures are all-embracing: they specify how a person should be born, how she should grow up, marry, have children, and die. Games fill out the interludes of the cultural script. They enhance action and concentration during “free time,” when cultural instructions offer little guidance, and a person’s attention threatens to wander into the uncharted realms of chaos.

Some people enjoy themselves wherever they are, while others stay bored even when confronted with the most dazzling prospects.

A less drastic obstacle to experiencing flow is excessive self-consciousness. A person who is constantly worried about how others will perceive her, who is afraid of creating the wrong impression, or of doing something inappropriate, is also condemned to permanent exclusion from enjoyment. So are people who are excessively self-centered. A self-centered individual is usually not self-conscious, but instead evaluates every bit of information only in terms of how it relates to her desires. For such a person everything is valueless in itself. A flower is not worth a second look unless it can be used; a man or a woman who cannot advance one’s interests does not deserve further attention. Consciousness is structured entirely in terms of its own ends, and nothing is allowed to exist in it that does not conform to those ends.

To lose oneself in an activity that offers no rewards outside the interaction itself.

Excessive self-consciousness and self-centeredness prevent it for the opposite reason: attention is too rigid and tight.

When a society suffers from anomie, flow is made difficult because it is not clear what is worth investing psychic energy in; when it suffers from alienation the problem is that one cannot invest psychic energy in what is clearly desirable.

Children who grow up in family situations that facilitate clarity of goals, feedback, feeling of control, concentration on the task at hand, intrinsic motivation, and challenge will generally have a better chance to order their lives so as to make flow possible.

Children who know what they can and cannot do, who do not have to constantly argue about rules and controls, who are not worried about their parents’ expectations for future success always hanging over their heads, are released from many of the attentional demands that more chaotic households generate. They are free to develop interests in activities that will expand their selves. In less well-ordered families a great deal of energy is expended in constant negotiations and strife, and in the children’s attempts to protect their fragile selves from being overwhelmed by other people’s goals.

Alexander Solzhenitsyn describes how one of his fellow prisoners in the Lefortovo jail mapped the world on the floor of the cell, and then imagined himself traveling across Asia and Europe to America, covering a few kilometers each day. The same “game” was independently discovered by many prisoners; for instance Albert Speer, Hitler’s favorite architect, sustained himself in Spandau prison for months by pretending he was taking a walking trip from Berlin to Jerusalem, in which his imagination provided all the events and sights along the way.

When every aspiration is frustrated, a person still must seek a meaningful goal around which to organize the self.

When every aspiration is frustrated, a person still must seek a meaningful goal around which to organize the self. Then, even though that person is objectively a slave, subjectively he is free.

He concludes that the most important trait of survivors is a “nonself-conscious individualism,” or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking.

If we were to consider one trait a key element of the autotelic personality, this might be it. Narcissistic individuals, who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apart when the external conditions turn threatening. The ensuing panic prevents them from doing what they must do; their attention turns inward in an effort to restore order in consciousness, and not enough remains to negotiate outside reality.

“Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.”.

Everything the body can do is potentially enjoyable. Yet many people ignore this capacity, and use their physical equipment as little as possible, leaving its ability to provide flow unexploited.

When left undeveloped, the senses give us chaotic information: an untrained body moves in random and clumsy ways, an insensitive eye presents ugly or uninteresting sights, the unmusical ear mainly hears jarring noises, the coarse palate knows only insipid tastes.

Greeks invented the discus, and the great discus throwers of antiquity were immortalized by the best sculptors; the Swiss gathered on holidays in mountain meadows to see who could toss the trunk of a tree farthest; the Scots did the same with gigantic rocks. In baseball nowadays pitchers become rich and famous because they can throw balls with speed and precision, and basketball players because they can sink them into hoops. Some athletes throw javelins; others are bowlers, shot-putters, or hammer throwers; some throw boomerangs or cast fishing lines. Each of these variations on the basic capacity to throw offers almost unlimited opportunities for enjoyment.

Enjoyable when it is transformed so as to produce flow. The essential steps in this process are: (a) to set an overall goal, and as many subgoals as are realistically feasible; (b) to find ways of measuring progress in terms of the goals chosen; (c) to keep concentrating on what one is doing, and to keep making finer and finer distinctions in the challenges involved in the activity; (d) to develop the skills necessary to interact with the opportunities available; and (e) to keep.

However, enjoyment, as we have seen, does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do.

People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards.

The urge to have sex is so powerful that it can drain psychic energy away from other necessary goals. Therefore every culture has to invest great efforts in rechanneling and restraining it, and many complex social institutions exist only in order to regulate this urge.

Having a record of the past can make a great contribution to the quality of life. It frees us from the tyranny of the present, and makes it possible for consciousness to revisit former times. It makes it possible to select and preserve in memory events that are especially pleasant and meaningful, and so to “create” a past that will help us deal with the future. Of course such a past might not be literally true. But then the past can never be literally true in memory: it must be continuously edited, and the question is only whether we take creative control of the editing or not.

They come to people who so enjoy playing with ideas that eventually they stray beyond the limits of what is known, and find themselves exploring an uncharted territory.

“normal” scientists are motivated in their work by the challenging intellectual puzzles they confront in their work, “revolutionary” scientists—the ones who break away from existing theoretical paradigms to forge new ones—are even more driven by enjoyment. A lovely example concerns Subrahhmanyan Chandrasekhar, the astrophysicist whose life has already acquired.

If “normal” scientists are motivated in their work by the challenging intellectual puzzles they confront in their work, “revolutionary” scientists—the ones who break away from existing theoretical paradigms to forge new ones—are even more driven by enjoyment. A lovely example concerns Subrahhmanyan Chandrasekhar, the astrophysicist whose life has already acquired mythical dimensions. When he left India as a young man in 1933, on a slow boat from Calcutta to England, he wrote out a model of stellar evolution that with time became the basis of the theory of black holes. But his ideas were so strange that for a long time they were not accepted by the scientific community. He eventually was hired by the University of Chicago, where he continued his studies in relative obscurity. There is one anecdote told about him that best typifies his commitment to his work. In the 1950s Chandrasekhar was staying in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, where the main astronomical observatory of the university is located, about eighty miles away from the main campus. That winter he was scheduled to teach one advanced seminar in astrophysics. Only two students signed up for it, and Chandrasekhar was expected to cancel the seminar, rather than go through the inconvenience of commuting. But he did not, and instead drove back to Chicago twice a week, along back-country roads, to teach the class. A few years later first one, then the other of those two former students won the Nobel prize for physics. Whenever this story used to be told, the narrator concluded with sympathetic regrets that it was a shame the professor himself never won the prize. That regret is no longer necessary, because in 1983 Chandrasekhar himself was awarded the Nobel for physics.

Susumu Tonegawa, who that same year received the Nobel prize for biology, was described by his wife as a “going-his-own-way kind of a person” who likes sumo wrestling because it takes individual effort and not team performance to win in that sport, just as in his own work. Clearly the necessity of sophisticated laboratories and enormous research teams has been somewhat exaggerated. Breakthroughs in science still depend primarily on the resources of a single mind.

“amateur,” from the Latin verb amare, “to love,” referred to a person who loved what he was doing. Similarly a “dilettante,” from the Latin delectare, “to find delight in,” was someone who enjoyed a given activity.

At that point the goal of studying is no longer to make the grade, earn a diploma, and find a good job. Rather, it is to understand what is happening around one, to develop a personally meaningful sense of what one’s experience is all about. From that will come the profound joy of the thinker, like that experienced by the disciples of Socrates that Plato describes in Philebus:“The young man who has drunk for the first time from that spring is as happy as if he had found a treasure of wisdom; he is positively enraptured. He will pick up any discourse, draw all its ideas together to make them into one, then take them apart and pull them to pieces. He will puzzle first himself, then also others, badger whoever comes near him, young and old, sparing not even his parents, nor anyone who is willing to listen….”.

The converse is also true: when supposedly enjoying their hard-earned leisure, people generally report surprisingly low moods; yet they keep on wishing for more leisure.

On the job people feel skillful and challenged, and therefore feel more happy, strong, creative, and satisfied. In their free time people feel that there is generally not much to do and their skills are not being used, and therefore they tend to feel more sad, weak, dull, and dissatisfied. Yet they would like to work less and spend more time in leisure.

Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback, rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it.

Hobbies that demand skill, habits that set goals and limits, personal interests, and especially inner discipline help to make leisure what it is supposed to be—a chance for re-creation.

“It is in the improvident use of our leisure, I suspect, that the greatest wastes of American life occur.”.

The flow experience that results from the use of skills leads to growth; passive entertainment leads nowhere.

Unless a person takes charge of them, both work and free time are likely to be disappointing. Most jobs and many leisure activities—especially those involving the passive consumption of mass media—are not designed to make us happy and strong. Their purpose is to make money for someone else. If we allow them to, they can suck out the marrow of our lives, leaving only feeble husks. But like everything else, work and leisure can be appropriated for our needs. People who learn to enjoy their work, who do not waste their free time, end up feeling that their lives as a whole have become much more worthwhile. “The future,” wrote C. K. Brightbill, “will belong not only to the educated man, but to the man who is educated to use his leisure wisely.”.

How we experience work, and our relations with other people.

Yet unless one learns to tolerate and even enjoy being alone, it is very difficult to accomplish any task that requires undivided concentration.

For this reason, it is essential to find ways to control consciousness even when we are left to our own devices.

“Whosoever is delighted in solitude,” goes the old saying that Francis Bacon repeated, “is either a wild beast or a god.”.

“I’ve had a wonderful and successful career. But next to my family, it really hasn’t mattered at all.”.

“Those have most power to hurt us that we love.”.

Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws. In other words, accepting limitations is liberating.

Differentiation means that each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals. Integration, in contrast, guarantees that what happens to one person will affect all others. If a child is proud of what she accomplished in school, the rest of the family will pay attention and will be proud of her, too. If the mother is tired and depressed, the family will try to help and cheer her up. In an integrated family, each person’s goals matter to all others.

We need not change ourselves to be with friends; they reinforce our sense of self instead of trying to transform it.

“For without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods.”.

There are few things as enjoyable as freely sharing one’s most secret feelings and thoughts with another person.

But now that there are fewer extrinsic pressures to get married, many people claim that their best friend is their spouse.

A good factory is not necessarily the one that makes the most money, but the one that is most responsible for improving the quality of life for its workers and its customers.

Man was born to be tested on this earth. Cars, television sets, clothes are secondary. The main thing is that we were born to praise the Lord. Everyone has his own fate, and we should be like the lion in the proverb. The lion, when he runs after a pack of gazelles, can only catch them one at a time.

What does it benefit to man if he gains the entire world, but loses himself?.

Because a job was ready for me, but I decided to sleep with the poor, because one must suffer to become a man.

One does not get to be a man by getting married, by having sex: to be a man means to be responsible, to know when it is time to speak, to know what has to be said, to know when one must stay silent.

I have been walking in freedom. Every man should get to know himself and experience life in all its forms. I could have gone on sleeping soundly in my bed, and found work in my town, because a job was ready for me, but I decided to sleep with the poor, because one must suffer to become a man. One does not get to be a man by getting married, by having sex: to be a man means to be responsible, to know when it is time to speak, to know what has to be said, to know when one must stay silent.

In fact, when average people are asked to name the individuals they admire the most, and to explain why these men and women are admired, courage and the ability to overcome hardship are the qualities most often mentioned as a reason for admiration.

“The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wished, but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired.”.

Most of the time may be said to have an autotelic self. The term literally means “a self that has self-contained goals,”.

The term literally means “a self that has self-contained goals,” and it reflects the idea that such an individual has relatively few goals that do not originate from within the self. For most people, goals are shaped directly by biological needs and social conventions, and therefore their origin is outside the self. For an autotelic person, the primary goals emerge from experience evaluated in consciousness, and therefore from the self proper.

But isn’t it incredibly naive to expect life to have a coherent overall meaning? After all, at least since Nietzsche concluded that God was dead, philosophers and social scientists have been busy demonstrating that existence has no purpose, that chance and impersonal forces rule our fate, and that all values are relative and hence arbitrary. It is true that life has no meaning, if by that we mean a supreme goal built into the fabric of nature and human experience, a goal that is valid for every individual. But it does not follow that life cannot be given meaning. Much of what we call culture and civilization consists in efforts people have made, generally against overwhelming odds, to create a sense of purpose for themselves and their descendants. It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless. It is another thing entirely to accept this with resignation. The first fact does not entail the second any more than the fact that we lack wings prevents us from flying.

“We don’t get upset because we believe that our life is in God’s hands, and whatever He decides will be fine with us.”.

A simple example may illustrate the difference between cultures organized around sensate and ideational principles. In our own as well as in fascist societies physical fitness is cherished and the beauty of the human body worshiped. But the reasons for doing so are very different. In our sensate culture, the body is cultivated in order to achieve health and pleasure. In an ideational culture, the body is valued primarily as a symbol of some abstract principle of metaphysical perfection associated with the idea of the “Aryan race,” or “Roman valor.”.

In a sensate culture, a poster of a handsome youth might produce a sexual response to be used for commercial ends. In an ideational culture, the same poster would make an ideological statement, and be used for political ends.

The price one pays for changing goals whenever opposition threatens is that while one may achieve a more pleasant and comfortable life, it is likely that it will end up empty and void of meaning.


# Britt-Marie Was Here (Fredrik Backman)

An unreasonable amount of paperwork is required these days just to be a human being.

The only two noticeable things in Borg are soccer and the pizzeria, because these tend to be the last things to abandon humanity.

It’s difficult to know when love blooms; suddenly one day you wake up and it’s in full flower. It works the same way when it wilts—one day it is just too late. Love has a great deal in common with balcony plants in that way. Sometimes not even baking soda makes a difference.

Not that Britt-Marie didn’t have any dreams of her own; it was just that his were bigger, and the one with the biggest dreams always wins in this world. She had learned that. So she stayed home to take care of his children, without even dreaming of having any of her own. She stayed home another few years to make a presentable home and support him in his career, without dreaming of her own. She found she had neighbors who called her a “nag-bag” when she worried about what the Germans would think if there was rubbish in the foyer or the stairwell smelled of pizza. She made no friends of her own, just the odd acquaintance, usually the wife of one of Kent’s business associates.

Britt-Marie has wondered the same thing an infinite number of times over the years: whether she had time to scream. And whether it would have made a difference. Their mother had told Ingrid to put on her belt, because Ingrid never put her belt on, and for that exact reason Ingrid had not put it on. They were arguing. That’s why they didn’t see it. Britt-Marie saw it because she always put her belt on, because she wanted her mother to notice. Which she obviously never did, because Britt-Marie never had to be noticed, for the simple reason that she always did everything without having to be told. It came from the right-hand side. Green. That’s one of the few things Britt-Marie remembers. It came from the right and there was glass and blood all over in the backseat of their parents’ car. The last thing Britt-Marie remembered before she passed out was that she wanted to clean it up. Make it nice. And when she woke up at the hospital that is precisely what she did. Clean. Make things nice. When they buried her sister and there were strangers in black clothes drinking coffee in her parents’ home, Britt-Marie put coasters under all the cups and washed all the dishes and cleaned all the windows. When her father began to stay at work for longer and longer and her mother stopped talking altogether, Britt-Marie cleaned. Cleaned, cleaned, and cleaned.

Ingrid was never negative. As always with people like this, it’s difficult to know whether everyone loved Ingrid because she was so positive, or if she was so positive because everyone loved her.

You’re never quite alone when you can stand on a balcony—you have all the cars and houses and the people in the streets.

You’re never quite alone when you can stand on a balcony—you have all the cars and houses and the people in the streets. You’re among them, but also not. That’s the best thing about balconies. The second best is standing out there early in the morning before Kent has woken up, closing your eyes and feeling the wind in your hair.

But tears are now running down Vega’s cheeks, and Britt-Marie can’t properly determine whether the child is going to give her a hug or a wallop.

Soccer is a curious game, because it doesn’t ask to be loved. It demands it.

Britt-Marie keeps her eyes on him and by and large doesn’t entirely dislike him.

Because it’s the first time in an absolute age that anyone has told Britt-Marie it’s important for her to be somewhere. Soccer is a curious game in that way. Because it doesn’t ask to be loved.

“I was once told that ‘You love soccer because it’s instinctive. If a ball comes rolling down the street you give it a punt. You love it for the same reason that you fall in love. Because you don’t know how to avoid it.’ ”.

For someone who loathes traveling, Britt-Marie has always had a great love of maps. There’s something reassuring about them, she’s always found, ever since Ingrid used to speak to her at night about Paris when they were children. You can look at a map and point at Paris. Things are understandable when you can point at them. She nods soberly at Somebody.

All marriages have their bad sides, because all people have weaknesses. If you live with another human being you learn to handle these weaknesses in a variety of ways. For instance, you might take the view that weaknesses are a bit like heavy pieces of furniture, and based on this you must learn to clean around them. To maintain the illusion. Of course the dust is building up unseen, but you learn to repress this for as long as it goes unnoticed by guests. And then one day someone moves a piece of furniture without your say-so, and everything comes into plain view. Dirt and scratch marks. Permanent damage to the parquet floor. By then it’s too late.

“Do you love him? Your husband?” asks the boy so suddenly that Britt-Marie almost snips him in the ear. She brushes down his shoulder with the back of her hand. Buries her gaze in his scalp. “Yes.” “Why isn’t he here, then?” “Because sometimes love isn’t enough.”.

Sometimes it’s easier to go on living, not even knowing who you are, when at least you know precisely where you are while you go on not knowing.

The human brain has a monstrous ability to re-create memories of such clarity that the rest of the body loses all sense of time. An approaching truck can make the ears believe they are hearing a mother screaming, can make the hands believe they are cutting themselves on glass, can make the lips taste blood. Deep inside, Britt-Marie has time to yell Ingrid’s name a thousand times.

“You know, here and there, when you have lemon in your arse you don’t want to sit still, do you?”.

She made his dreams her own. His life became her life. She was good at this, and people want to do the things they’re good at. People want someone to know they are there.

Because life is more than the shoes your feet are in.

Because life is more than the shoes your feet are in. More than the person you are. It’s the togetherness. The parts of yourself in another. Memories and walls and cupboards and drawers with compartments for cutlery, so you know where everything is.

A year turned into several years, and several years turned into all the years. One morning you wake up with more life behind you than in front of you, not being able to understand how it’s happened.

There are an awful lot of things you are not equipped to know about yourself until you have a pistol pointing at your face.

Authority. In the end Britt-Marie gets so worked up about this that she takes her notebook and tears out her list for the whole day, and starts one completely fresh. She has never done this in her whole life,.

Authority. In the end Britt-Marie gets so worked up about this that she takes her notebook and tears out her list for the whole day, and starts one completely fresh. She has never done this in her whole life, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

She would have been capable of climbing mountains or crossing oceans, if someone had asked her to.

Because she likes holding it while he’s also holding it. She peers at him and wants to say that it’s not his fault. That she’s just too old to fall in love. She wants to tell him that he can find himself someone better. That he deserves something perfect. But she doesn’t say anything,.

She peers at him and wants to say that it’s not his fault. That she’s just too old to fall in love. She wants to tell him that he can find himself someone better. That he deserves something perfect. But she doesn’t say anything, because she’s afraid he’ll say she is perfect.

She sits on the stool in the kitchen, staring at the wall and waiting for a black car. It does not come. She wonders if Sami thinks about how one should live one’s life, if he has ever had that luxury. A human being can’t choose his circumstances, admittedly, but in Sami’s life there have been more circumstances than events. She asks herself if choices or circumstances make us the sort of people we become—or what it was that made Sami the sort of person who steps in. She wonders what takes the most out of a person: to be the kind that jumps, or the kind that doesn’t?.

What is love if it’s not loving our lovers even when they don’t deserve.

What is love if it’s not loving our lovers even when they don’t deserve it? The headlights.

What is love if it’s not loving our lovers even when they don’t deserve it?.

That’s how I found out about sodium bicarbonate. The body produces sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic substances in the stomach. When one dies, the body stops producing the sodium bicarbonate, so the acidic substances eat their way through the skin and end up on the floor. That’s when it smells, you have to understand.”.

The truck comes up on her right, from behind. Too close. Too fast. That’s why she throws.

That is the reason why passion is worth something, not for what it gives us but for what it demands that we risk. Our dignity. The puzzlement of others and their condescending, shaking heads.

One remarkable thing about communities built along roads is that you can find just as many reasons for leaving them as excuses to make you stay.

# The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World (Daniel Yergin)

Will enough energy be available to meet the needs of a growing world and at what cost and with what technologies? How can the security of the energy system on which the world depends be protected? What will be the impact of environmental concerns, including climate change, on the future of energy—and how will energy development affect the environment?.

What gave them a common definition was that they were based neither on fossil fuels nor on nuclear power.

The renewed uncertainty and insecurity about energy, and the anticipation of deeper crisis, underscored a fundamental reality—how important energy is to the world.

One of the nineteenth century’s greatest scientists, William Thomson—better known as Lord Kelvin—warned in 1881, in his presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Edinburgh, that Britain’s energy base was precarious and that disaster was impending. His fear was not about oil, but about coal, which had generated the “Age of Steam,” fueled Britain’s industrial preeminance, and made the words of “Rule, Britannia!” a reality in world power. Kelvin somberly warned that Britain’s days of greatness might be numbered because “the subterranean coal-stores of the world” were “becoming exhausted surely, and not slowly” and the day was drawing close when “so little of it is left.” The only hope he could offer was “that windmills or wind-motors in some form will again be in the ascendant.”.

“Today, coal, oil and natural gas supply 93 percent of the world’s energy,” Rickover declared in 1957. That was, he said, a “startling reversal” from just a century earlier, in 1850, when “fossil fuels supplied 5 percent of the world’s energy, and men and animals 94 percent.” This harnessing of energy was what made possible a standard of living far higher than that of the mid-nineteenth century. But Rickover’s central point was that fossil fuels would run out sometime after 2000—and most likely before 2050.

There is one key energy source that most people do not think of as an energy source. Sometimes it is called conservation; sometimes efficiency. It is hard to conceptualize and hard to mobilize and yet it can make the biggest contribution of all to the energy balance in the years immediately ahead.

“Superpower,” he said, was “the word we used during the Cold War,” and the Cold War was over. “I have never referred to Russia as an energy superpower. But we do have greater possibilities than almost any other country in the world. If put together Russia’s energy potential in all areas, oil, gas, and nuclear, our country is unquestionably the leader.”.

It was Ludwig Nobel who conceived and built the world’s first oil tanker, to transport petroleum on the stormy Caspian Sea.

Shell Oil had been founded on the basis of oil from Baku, audaciously brought to world oil markets by an extraordinary entrepreneur and onetime shell merchant named Marcus Samuel.

With the collapse of the Russian Empire at the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution during World War I, the region west of the Caspian Sea, including Baku, declared itself the independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. It established one of the first modern parliaments in the Islamic world. It was also the first Muslim country to grant women the right to vote (ahead of such countries as Britain and the United States). But Lenin declared that his new revolutionary state could not survive without Baku’s oil, and in 1920 the Bolsheviks conquered the republic, incorporating it into the new Soviet Union and nationalizing the oil fields.

“Political activity revolved around the struggle to distribute the wealth, rather than the creation of a sustainable source of wealth that would depend upon the commercial initiatives and the productivity of the majority of the Venezuelan people.”.

The term describes an ailment that the Netherlands contracted in the 1960s. Around that time, the Netherlands was becoming a major natural gas exporter. As the new gas wealth flowed into the country, the rest of the Dutch economy suffered. The national currency became overvalued and exports became relatively more expensive—and, thus, declined. Domestic businesses became less competitive in the face of the rising tide of cheaper imports and increasingly embedded inflation. Jobs were lost and businesses couldn’t survive. All of this came to be known as Dutch disease.

There were many other ties as well. During the late 1970s, the Saudi cabinet was said to have more members with American Ph.D.s. than the U.S. cabinet.1.

President Bush laid out the fundamentals of the new policy in a speech at West Point in June 2002. Traditional “deterrence” did not work against “shadowy terrorist networks.” And “containment” did not work “when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver these weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies.” The only answer was “preemptive action,” Bush added, “if we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long.”.

WHERE ARE THE PETROLEUM ENGINEERS?.

In November 2001 an economist at Goldman Sachs, Jim O’Neill, put out a research paper hatching a new concept: “the BRICs”—Brazil, Russia, India, and China. These four large-population economies, he said, were destined to grow faster than the main industrial economies. He made the startling prediction that within a few decades they would, as a group, overtake the combined GDP of the United States and the world’s five other largest economies.

A few days later, the head of one of the world’s largest state-owned energy companies declared that oil would hit $250 a barrel in the “foreseeable future.”.

On June 15, oil prices reached $139.89. The airline industry certainly had its back against the wall. In earlier years, fuel prices had been about 20 percent of operating costs; now they were up around 45 percent, bigger even than labor costs. Bankruptcies seemed inevitable—the only way out.19.

That includes the introduction of the digital oil field of the future. Sensors are deployed in all parts of the field, including in the wells. This dramatically improves the clarity and comprehensiveness of data and the communication between the field and a company’s technology centers, and allows operators to utilize more powerful computing resources to process incoming data. If widely adopted, the “digital oil field” could also make it possible to recover, worldwide, an enormous amount of additional oil—by one estimate, an extra 125 billion barrels of oil—almost equivalent to Iraq’s reserves.

New technologies are developed to identify new resources and to produce more from existing fields. For instance, in a typical oil field, only about 35 to 40 percent of the oil in place is produced using traditional methods. Much technology is being developed and applied to raising that recovery rate. That includes the introduction of the digital oil field of the future. Sensors are deployed in all parts of the field, including in the wells. This dramatically improves the clarity and comprehensiveness of data and the communication between the field and a company’s technology centers, and allows operators to utilize more powerful computing resources to process incoming data. If widely adopted, the “digital oil field” could also make it possible to recover, worldwide, an enormous amount of additional oil—by one estimate, an extra 125 billion barrels of oil—almost equivalent to Iraq’s reserves.

The argument focused on the supergiant Ghawar field, the largest oil field in the world.

“We used to joke all the time that much more oil was discovered by the petroleum engineers, developing and expanding the fields, than by us explorers, who actually found the fields.”.

What are the prospects for the future? One answer is drawn from an analysis using a database that includes 70,000 oil fields and 4.7 million individual wells, combined with existing production and 350 new projects. The conclusion is that the world is clearly not running out of oil. Far from it. The estimates for the world’s total stock of oil keep growing.

The world has produced about 1 trillion barrels of oil since the start of the industry in the nineteenth century. Currently, it is thought that there are at least 5 trillion barrels of petroleum resources, of which 1.4 trillion is sufficiently developed and technically and economically accessible to count as proved plus probable reserves. Based upon current and prospective plans, it appears the world liquid production capacity should grow from about 93 million barrels per day in 2010 to about 110 mbd by 2030. This is about a 20 percent increase.

These are the liquids that accompany the production of natural gas. Condensates are captured from gas when it comes out of the well. Natural gas liquids are separated out when the gas is processed for injection into a pipeline. Both are similar to high-quality light oils.

The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), along with the other IEA stocks, can be thought of as a giant insurance policy. Yet, often enough, when prices rise at the gasoline pumps, so do temptations and calls to “do something”—which means release oil from the SPR in order to bring prices down. That would have the effect of turning the reserve into a de facto tool for price controls. Tempting, for sure, but not the wisest policy.

Today Qatar has the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world and has become one of the main commercial hubs of the Persian Gulf.

After experimenting with a wide variety of possible sources—including hairs from the beards of two of his employees—he came up with a series of carbon filament, first made from cotton thread and then from cardboard and then bamboo, that passed the test.

Yet the superiority of alternating current was so clear that Westinghouse’s alternating current system prevailed. Westinghouse grabbed market share from Edison and established the foundations for large-scale generation. Edison’s technological stubbornness weakened his company financially during a time of business difficulties. His company, Edison General Electric—against his own fervent protestations—was forced into a merger with a competitor. To add to the ignominy and Edison’s pain, the merger stripped his name from the merged company. Thereafter, it would be known simply as General Electric.

Avoided costs were a very interesting concept: It was an estimate of how much the same amount of power would cost were it generated from an oil- or gas-fired facility. It was not an actual price, but an expected price sometime in the future.

The prospects for electric power in the twenty-first century can be summarized in a single word: growth.

India’s power consumption is expected to increase fivefold between 2010 and 2030.

The most prominent answer today is carbon capture and sequestration (or storage), better known by the shorthand CCS. To “sequester” something is to isolate it or set it apart; the concept here is to keep carbon out of the atmosphere by capturing it and burying it underground. “CCS is the critical future technology option for reducing CO2 emissions while keeping coal’s use above today’s level,” said the MIT study The Future of Coal. CO2 can be captured in several ways,.

CO2 can be captured in several ways, either before or after the coal is burned. One of the various methods, the only one that could likely be adapted to an existing coal plant, is capturing the CO2 after burning the coal. For the others it would be so expensive and complicated that it would be cheaper just to scrap the existing plant and build a new one.

To describe his vocation in his classic work, Voyages dans les Alpes, he invented the word “geology.” Saussure was fascinated by heat and altitude, and built devices to measure temperatures at the tops of mountains and the bottoms of lakes.4.

His wife had accidentally administered an overdose of sleep nostrum to relieve his intolerable insomnia. As he slipped away, he murmured, “My poor darling, you have killed your John.”8.

Revelle started off to be a geologist, but a fear of heights made him shy away from climbing up the sides of mountains, and he turned instead to the study of the depths of the oceans.

This was Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian economist and engineer who was accepting the award on behalf of the IPCC because he was its chairman. Pachauri coordinated a complex international network that involved the work of 450 lead authors, 2,500 scientific expert reviewers, and 800 contributing authors, representing altogether 113 countries—along with the representatives of those governments, all of whom had to acquiesce at least to the overall summary.

“India has not caused the problem of global warming. But try and make sure that India is part of the solution.”.

India’s traditional approach to international climate change negotiations was to reiterate even more strongly that it is a developing country with much poverty and that it and its economic growth should not be penalized for emissions that industrial countries have been putting into the atmosphere for over two centuries. Moreover, in the words of Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, it was the “kiss of death” for an Indian politician to be seen agreeing with the United States or the European Union on climate change policy. But as India becomes more integrated into the world economy, the perspective is changing. When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appointed Ramesh to the Environment ministry, he instructed him, “India has not caused the problem of global warming. But try and make sure that India is part of the solution.”.

One other technology needs to be added to the list: batteries for electric cars. These are not strictly renewable in the same way but fall within the same framework. They could count as renewable if the electricity by which they are recharged happens to be the product of wind or sunlight.

If Jimmy Carter was the energy pessimist, prophesying about the great dangers ahead and warning Americans to change their ways, Ronald Reagan was the opposite, the sunny optimist, the beacon of self-confidence, the proponent of a new “morning in America.”.

In the early 1970s, Kotaro Ikeguchi was a rising young official in MITI, Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Assigned to a department dealing with energy and mining, he became alarmed that Japan had become dangerously overreliant on Middle East oil and was oblivious to the risks. The consequences of a cutoff of supply could be disastrous. But Ikeguchi could not stir much interest. For Japan’s high-speed economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s had been fueled by Middle Eastern oil, and there was little expectation that would change. So as an outlet for his anxieties, Ikeguchi decided to write a novel that might wake up both officialdom and the public to Japan’s vulnerability. His imaginary crisis was a Middle Eastern war that resulted in a cutoff of imports. His hero? By coincidence, it was a spry, incisive, but very pragmatic MITI bureaucrat with an understanding of Japan’s precarious energy dependence. Since he was a working bureaucrat, he needed a pen name. He came up with “Taichi Sakaiya,” which means, loosely, “Big Man on the Roof of the World.” But before he could find a publisher, reality intruded. His fiction became nonfiction. With the 1973 oil crisis, the Japanese suddenly feared that their whole edifice of economic growth might collapse. Ikeguchi decided it would be inappropriate to publish his novel while the Japanese people were suffering through a real energy shortage, and he put it into a drawer.

Though largely forgotten, the major oil companies were early on among the main players in the development of photovoltaics in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Energy supports a sprawling R&D enterprise that extends from national laboratories like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to university scientists, private contractors, and companies. The DOE’s 17 national laboratories alone employ over 12,000 Ph.D. scientists full time, making it the largest employer of scientists in the world. Overall the DOE is also the “ministry of science” for the physical sciences, supporting almost half of all the physical sciences research in the United States, including over time the work of 111 Nobel Prize winners.

Challenges and the need for innovation. The total annual energy R&D spending in 2008 was equivalent to two weeks’ spending on the Iraq War.8.

Some like to say that venture capital—putting money into start-ups, betting on entrepreneurs and innovators—goes back much further. “Queen Isabella of Spain was one of the early venture capitalists when she backed Columbus,” said William Draper III, a veteran venture capitalist. She put her faith in a management team led by Christopher Columbus. “What she did was look into Columbus’s eyes and say that this guy might really sail off to some land and bring back some jewels.” J. P. Morgan’s funding of Thomas Edison’s electricity start-up in the 1870s and 1880s certainly qualifies as proto–venture capital.

He even delivered a lecture to what were then all-male classes on how to properly pick a wife.

Energy, at least energy production, is different in terms of time, money, and scale. “I see few similarities between the digital world and the energy world,” said Ray Lane. “There is no Moore’s Law. In fact, there are different laws like thermodynamics, physical relationships, chemical reactions, and biological systems. It is a policy-influenced, low-cost, mature, capital-intensive industry, which investors must understand. I recommend leaving.

Of course, a Google of energy may happen. It may even be happening right now but might not be recognized for five years. After all, how many people had heard of Google in 1998? But energy is different, very different. Google was helping to create a new industry—search—but not to take away market share from incumbent commodity suppliers, on which the entire economy depends.

But there is no photo op, no opening ceremony where government officials and company executives can cut a ribbon, smile broadly into the camera, and inaugurate a grand new facility. He shook his head as he considered one of the most powerful of the life lessons he had learned from his deep immersion in global politics.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founder and former prime minister of modern Singapore, once described air-conditioning as “the most important invention of the twentieth century,” because, he explained, it enabled the people of the tropics to become productive. Singapore’s minister of the environment was a little more explicit, saying that, without air-conditioning, “instead of working in high-tech factories” Singapore’s workers “would probably be sitting under coconut trees.”6.

“I don’t think Nature would be so unkind as to withhold the secret of a good storage battery, if a real earnest hunt were made for it,”.

Natural gas would in effect become a motor fuel, but indirectly, by generating more of the electricity that ends up in the battery of an electric.

That is at the heart of the quest, it is as much about the human spirit as it is about technology, and that is why this is a quest that will never end.


# Economy NCERT (Girish)

The narrative is partly based on a research study by Gilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in Western Uttar Pradesh.

One hectare equals the area of a square with one side measuring 100 metres.

During the rainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar and bajra.

In the winter season (rabi), fields are sown with wheat.

You have seen that one way of increasing production from the same land is by multiple cropping. The other way is to use modern farming methods for higher yield.

The Green Revolution in the late 1960s introduced the Indian farmer to cultivation of wheat and rice using high yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds. Compared to the traditional seeds, the HYV seeds promised to produce much greater amounts of grain on a single plant. As a result, the same piece of land would now produce far larger quantities of foodgrains than was possible earlier. HYV seeds, however, needed plenty of water and also chemical fertilizers and pesticides to produce best results.

Farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh were the first to try out the modern farming method in India.

In many areas, Green Revolution is associated with the loss of soil fertility due to increased use of chemical fertilizers. Also, continuous use of groundwater for tubewell irrigation has reduced the water-table below the ground. Environmental resources like soil fertility and groundwater are built up over many years. Once destroyed it is very difficult to restore them. We must take care of the environment to ensure future development of agriculture.

Investment in human resource (via education and medical care) can give high rates of return in the future. This investment on people is the same as investment in land and capital. One invests in shares and bonds expecting higher return in the future.

Primary sector includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing, poultry farming, mining, and quarrying. Manufacturing is included in the secondary sector. Trade, transport, communication, banking, education, health, tourism, services, insurance etc. are included in the tertiary sector.

The literacy rates have increased from 18% in 1951 to 74% in 2010-11.Literacy.

The literacy rates have increased from 18% in 1951 to 74% in 2010-11.Literacy is not only a right, it is also needed if the citizen are to perform their duties and enjoy their rights properly.

Mid-day meal scheme has been implemented to encourage attendance and retention of children and improve their nutritional status. These policies could add to the literate population of India.

The life expectancy to over 65 years in 2011. *Infant mortality rate (IMR) has come down from 147 in 1951 to 47 in 2010.

The workforce population includes people from 15 years to 59 years. Sakal’s brother and sister do not fall within this age group so they cannot be called unemployed.

Us. In fact, every fourth person in India is poor. This means, roughly 300 million (or 30 crore) people in India live in poverty.

This means, roughly 300 million (or 30 crore) people in India live in poverty.

They show that poverty means hunger and lack of shelter.

It also is a situation in which parents are not able to send their children to school or a situation where sick people cannot afford treatment.

Poverty also means lack of clean water and sanitation facilities.

It also means lack of a regular job at a minimum decent level. Above all it means living with a sense of helplessness.

They show that poverty means hunger and lack of shelter. It also is a situation in which parents are not able to send their children to school or a situation where sick people cannot afford treatment. Poverty also means lack of clean water and sanitation facilities. It also means lack of a regular job at a minimum decent level. Above all it means living with a sense of helplessness. Poor people are in a situation in which they are ill-treated at almost every place, in farms, factories, government offices, hospitals, railway stations etc. Obviously, nobody would like to live in poverty.

Mahatama Gandhi always insisted that India would be truly independent only when the poorest of its people become free of human suffering.

According to this concept, poverty must be seen in terms of the poor having to live only in a poor surrounding with other poor people, excluded from enjoying social equality of better-off people in better surroundings. Social exclusion can be both a cause as well as a consequence of poverty in the usual sense. Broadly, it is a process through which individuals or groups are excluded from facilities, benefits and opportunities that others (their “betters”) enjoy. A typical example is the working of the caste system in India in which people belonging to certain castes are excluded from equal opportunities. Social exclusion thus may lead to, but can cause more damage than, having a very low income.

Vulnerability to poverty is a measure, which describes the greater probability of certain communities (say, members of a backward caste) or individuals (such as a widow or a physically handicapped person) of becoming, or remaining, poor in the coming years. Vulnerability is determined by the options available to different communities for finding an alternative living in terms of assets, education, health and job opportunities. Further, it is analysed on the basis of the greater risks these groups face at the time of natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunami), terrorism etc. Additional analysis is made of their social and economic ability to handle these risks. In fact, vulnerability describes the greater probability of being more adversely affected than other people when bad time comes for everybody, whether a flood or an earthquake or simply a fall in the availability of jobs!.

A person is considered poor if his or her income or consumption level falls below a given “minimum level” necessary to fulfill basic needs.

While determining the poverty line in India, a minimum level of food requirement, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, educational and medical requirement etc. are determined for subsistence.

Although the average for people below poverty line for all groups in India is 30, 48 out of 100 people belonging to scheduled tribes in rural areas are not able to meet their basic needs.

Similarly, 47 per cent of casual workers in urban areas are below poverty line. About 50 per cent of landless agricultural workers and 43 per cent of scheduled castes are also poor.

The double disadvantage, of being a landless casual wage labour household in the socially disadvantaged social groups of the scheduled caste or the scheduled tribe population highlights the seriousness of the problem.

On the other hand, poverty is still a serious problem in Orissa, Bihar, Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh.

Along with rural poverty, urban poverty is also high in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

In comparison, there has been a significant decline in poverty in Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal.

In comparison, there has been a significant decline in poverty in Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal. States like Punjab and Haryana have traditionally succeeded in reducing poverty with the help of high agricultural growth rates. Kerala has focused more on human resource development. In West Bengal, land reform measures have helped in reducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu public distribution of food grains could have been responsible for the improvement.

Poverty declined substantially in China and Southeast Asian countries as a result of rapid economic growth and massive investments in human resource development. Number of poors in China has come down from 85 per cent in 1981 to 14 per cent in 2008.

Certain social and economic groups are more vulnerable to poverty. Poverty reduction is expected to make better progress in the next ten to fifteen years. This would be possible mainly due to higher economic growth, increasing stress on universal free elementary education, declining population growth, increasing empowerment of the women and the economically weaker sections of society.

(a) availability of food means food production within the country, food imports and the previous years stock stored in government granaries.

(b) accessibility means food is within reach of every person.

(c) affordability implies that an individual has enough money to buy sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet one's dietary needs. Thus, food security is ensured in a country only.

There are certain terms used in this chapter that would require clarification — Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and Human Development Index.

A girl expects as much freedom and opportunity as her brother, and that he also shares in the household work. Her brother may not like this. Similarly, to get more electricity, industrialists may want more dams. But this may submerge the land and disrupt the lives of people who are displaced – such as tribals. They might resent this and may prefer small.

The healthiest student may not be the most studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how do we compare students?.

The value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. And the sum of production in the three sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is.

Credit (loan) refers to an agreement in which the lender supplies the borrower with money, goods or services in return for the promise of future payment.

In general, MNCs set up production where it is close to the markets; where there is skilled and unskilled labour available at low costs; and where the availability of other factors of production is assured. In addition, MNCs might look for government policies that look after their interests. You will read more about the policies later in the chapter.

Globalisation is this process of rapid integration or interconnection between countries.

These organisations say that all barriers to foreign trade and investment are harmful. There should be no barriers.

World Trade Organisation (WTO) is one such organisation whose aim is to liberalise international trade. Started at the initiative of the developed countries, WTO establishes rules regarding international trade, and sees that these rules are obeyed. Nearly 150 countries of the world are currently members of the WTO (2006). Though WTO is supposed to allow free trade for all, in practice, it is seen that the developed countries have unfairly retained trade barriers. On the other hand, WTO rules have forced the developing countries to remove trade barriers. An example of this is the current debate on trade in agricultural products.

Markets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few and powerful whereas consumers purchase in small amounts and are scattered.

“India is the pivot of our Empire... If the Empire loses any other part of its Dominion we can survive, but if we lose India, the sun of our Empire will have set.”.

The sole purpose of the British colonial rule in India was to reduce the country to being a raw material supplier for Great Britain’s own rapidly expanding modern industrial base.

Most studies did find that the country’s growth of aggregate real output during the first half of the twentieth century was less than two per cent coupled with a meagre half per cent growth in per capita output per year.

India’s economy under the British colonial rule remained fundamentally agrarian — about 85 per cent of the country’s population lived mostly in villages and derived livelihood directly or indirectly from agriculture.

This stagnation in the agricultural sector was caused mainly because of the various systems of land settlement that were introduced by the colonial government.

This stagnation in the agricultural sector was caused mainly because of the various systems of land settlement that were introduced by the colonial government. Particularly, under the zamindari system which was implemented in the then Bengal Presidency comprising parts of India’s present-day eastern states, the profit accruing out of the agriculture sector went to the zamindars instead of the cultivators.

The French traveller, Bernier, described seventeenth century Bengal in the following way: “The knowledge I have acquired of Bengal in two visits inclines me to believe that it is richer than Egypt. It exports, in abundance, cottons and silks, rice, sugar and butter. It produces amply — for its own consumption —wheat, vegetables, grains, fowls, ducks and geese. It has immense herds of pigs and flocks of sheep and goats. Fish of every kind it has in profusion. From rajmahal to the sea is an endless number of canals, cut in bygone ages from the Ganges by immense labour for navigation and irrigation.”.

The main interest of the zamindars was only to collect rent regardless of the economic condition of the cultivators; this caused immense misery and social tension among the latter.

To a very great extent, the terms of the revenue settlement were also responsible for the zamindars adopting such an attitude; dates for depositing specified sums of revenue were fixed, failing which the zamindars were to lose their rights. Besides this, low levels of technology, lack of irrigation facilities and negligible use of fertilisers, all added up to aggravate the plight of the farmers and contributed to the dismal level of agricultural productivity. There was, of course, some evidence of a relatively higher yield of cash crops in certain areas of the country due to commercialisation of agriculture. But this could hardly help farmers in improving their economic condition as, instead of producing food crops, now they were producing cash crops which were to be ultimately used by British industries back home.

Despite some progress made in irrigation, India’s agriculture was starved of investment in terracing, flood-control, drainage and desalinisation of soil. While a small section of farmers changed their cropping pattern from food crops to commercial crops, a large section of tenants, small farmers and sharecroppers neither had resources and technology nor had incentive to invest in agriculure.

The intention was, first, to reduce India to the status of a mere exporter of important raw materials for the upcoming modern industries in Britain and, second, to turn India into a sprawling market for the finished products of those industries so that their continued expansion could be ensured to the maximum advantage of their home country — Britain.

Capital goods industry means industries which can produce machine tools which are, in turn, used for producing articles for current consumption.

As a result, more than half of India’s foreign trade was restricted to Britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Persia (Iran). The opening of the Suez Canal further intensified British control over India’s foreign trade (see Box 1.3).

Suez Canal is an artificial waterway running from north to south across the Isthmus of Suez in north-eastern Egypt.

The roads that were built primarily served the purposes of mobilising the army within India and drawing out raw materials from the countryside to the nearest railway station or the port to send these to far away England or other lucrative foreign destinations.

The railways affected the structure of the Indian economy in two important ways. On the one hand it enabled people to undertake long distance travel and thereby break geographical and cultural barriers while, on the other hand, it fostered commercialisation of Indian agriculture which adversely affected the self-sufficiency of the village economies in India. The volume of India’s exports undoubtedly expanded but its benefits rarely accrued to the Indian people.

Among the notable estimators — Dadabhai Naoroji, William Digby, Findlay Shirras, V.K.R.V. Rao and R.C. Desai — it was Rao, whose estimates during the colonial period was considered very significant.

In a market economy, also called capitalism, only those consumer goods will be produced that are in demand, i.e., goods that can be sold profitably either in the domestic or in the foreign markets. If cars are in demand, cars will be produced and if bicycles are in demand, bicycles will be produced. If labour is cheaper than capital, more labour-intensive methods of production will be used and vice-versa. In a capitalist society the goods produced are distributed among people not on the basis of what people need but on the basis of Purchasing Power—the ability to buy goods and services.

Every society has to answer three questions What goods and services should be produced in the country?  How should the goods and services be produced? Should producers use more human labour or more capital (machines) for producing things? How should the goods and services be distributed among people?.

A socialist society answers the three questions in a totally different manner. In a socialist society the government decides what goods are to be produced in accordance with the needs of society.

The government decides how goods are to be produced and how they should be distributed. In principle, distribution under socialism is supposed to be based on what people need and not on what they can afford to purchase.

Strictly, a socialist society has no private property since everything is owned by the state.

The ‘Industrial Policy Resolution’ of 1948 and the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution reflected this outlook. In 1950, the Planning Commission was set up with the Prime Minister as its Chairperson. The era of five year plans had begun.

Some of these economists became Nobel Prize winners later, which shows that he could identify individuals with talent.

You can think of the GDP as a cake and growth is increase in the size of the cake.

It refers to increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country.

The GDP of a country is derived from the different sectors of the economy, namely the agricultural sector, the industrial sector and the service sector. The contribution made by each of these sectors makes up the structural composition of the economy.

Adoption of new technology is called modernisation.

However, modernisation does not refer only to the use of new technology but also to changes in social outlook such as the recognition that women should have the same rights as men.

In the absence of ownership, there was no incentive on the part of farmers to be efficient, which also explains the poor performance of the agricultural sector in the Soviet Union despite availability of vast areas of highly fertile land.

In India, between 1950 and 1990, the proportion of GDP contributed by agriculture declined significantly but not the population depending on it (67.5 per cent in 1950 to 64.9 per cent by 1990).

Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 (IPR 1956): In accordance with the goal of the state controlling the commanding heights of the economy, the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 was adopted. This resolution formed the basis of the Second Five Year Plan, the plan which tried to build the basis for a socialist pattern of society. This resolution classified industries into three categories. The first category comprised industries which would be exclusively owned by the state; the second category consisted of industries in which the private sector could supplement the efforts of the state sector, with the state taking the sole responsibility for starting new units; the third category consisted of the remaining industries which were to be in the private sector.

The policy of protection is based on the notion that industries of developing countries are not in a position to compete against the goods produced by more developed economies.

(indeed, quite a few of the public sector firms were originally private firms which were on the verge of closure due to losses; they were then nationalised.

(indeed, quite a few of the public sector firms were originally private firms which were on the verge of closure due to losses; they were then nationalised to protect the jobs of the workers).

When expenditure is more than income, the government borrows to finance the deficit from banks and also from people within the country and from international financial institutions.

This set of policies can broadly be classified into two groups: the stabilisation measures and the structural reform measures.

The only industries which are now reserved for the public sector are defence equipments, atomic energy generation and railway transport.

The financial sector in India is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The RBI decides the amount of money that the banks can keep with themselves, fixes interest rates, nature of lending to various sectors etc. One of the major aims of financial sector reforms is to reduce the role of RBI from regulator to facilitator of financial sector. This means that the financial sector may be allowed to take decisions on many matters without consulting the RBI.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) such as merchant bankers, mutual funds and pension funds are now allowed to invest in Indian financial markets.

Tax reforms are concerned with the reforms in government’s taxation and public expenditure policies which are collectively known as its fiscal policy.

Since 1991, there has been a continuous reduction in the taxes on individual incomes as it was felt that high rates of income tax were an important reason for tax evasion. It is now widely accepted that moderate rates of income tax encourage savings and voluntary disclosure of income.

In 1991, as an immediate measure to resolve the balance of payments crisis, the rupee was devalued against foreign currencies.

Privatisation of the public sector undertakings by selling off part of the equity of PSUs to the public is known as disinvestment.

The government has also made attempts to improve the efficiency of PSUs by giving them autonomy in taking managerial decisions.

Whereas others call it as outright sale of public property to the vested interests. What do you think?.

Although globalisation is generally understood to mean integration of the economy of the country with the world economy, it is a complex phenomenon.

The WTO was founded in 1995 as the successor organisation to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT).

For example, although all quota restrictions on exports of textiles and clothing have been removed in India, U.S.A. has not removed their quota restriction on import of textiles from India and China.

No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. Adam Smith.

Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not being able to go to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job. Poverty is fear for the future, having food once in a day. Poverty is losing a child to illness, brought about by unclear water. Poverty is powerlessness, lack of representation and freedom. What do you think?.

When the number of poor is estimated as the proportion of people below the poverty line, it is known as ‘Head Count Ratio’.

The ratio is declining much slower than the absolute number of poor in the country.

It reveals that five states — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa — account for about 70 per cent of India’s poor.

Britain’s main goals from the Raj were to provide a market for British exports, to have India service its debt payments to Britain, and for India to provide manpower for the British imperial armies.

Those who posses the means of production and earn good incomes and those who have only their labour to trade for survival.

Over the years, the government has been following three approaches to reduce poverty in India: growth oriented development, specific poverty alleviation programmes and meeting the minimum needs of the poor.

Think of one factor that has made a great difference in the evolution of mankind. Perhaps it is man’s capacity to store and transmit knowledge which he has been doing through conversation, through songs and through elaborate lectures. But man soon found out that we need a good deal of training and skill to do things efficiently. We know that the labour skill of an educated person is more than that of an uneducated person and hence the former is able to generate more income than the latter and his contribution to economic growth is, consequently, more.

Education is sought not only as it confers higher earning capacity on people but also for its other highly valued benefits: it gives one a better social standing and pride; it enables one to make better choices in life; it provides knowledge to understand the changes taking place in society; it also stimulates innovations. Moreover, the availability of educated labour force facilitates adaptation of new technologies. Economists have stressed the need for expanding educational opportunities in a nation as it accelerates the development process.

Spending on education by individuals is similar to spending on capital goods by companies with the objective of increasing future profits over a period of time.

Deutsche Bank, a German bank, in its report on ‘Global Growth Centres’ (published on 1.7.05) identified that India will emerge as one among four major growth centres in the world by the year 2020.

Deutsche Bank, a German bank, in its report on ‘Global Growth Centres’ (published on 1.7.05) identified that India will emerge as one among four major growth centres in the world by the year 2020. It further states, “Our empirical investigation supports the view that human capital is the most important factor of production in today’s economies. Increases in human capital are crucial to achieving increases in GDP.”.

(it is judged that Ireland uses its knowledge economy very effectively),.

It further states that the Indian economy has all the key ingredients for making this transition, such as, a critical mass of skilled workers, a well-functioning democracy and a diversified science and technology infrastructure.

This expenditure by the government is expressed in two ways (i) as a percentage of ‘total government expenditure’ (ii) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The percentage of ‘education expenditure of total government expenditure’ indicates the importance of education in the scheme of things before the government. The percentage of ‘education expenditure of GDP’ expresses how much of our income is being committed to the development of education in the country.

“Only the tillers of the soil live by the right. The rest form their train and eat only the bread of dependence”.

There is a greater need today to make rural areas more vibrant through diversification into dairying, poultry, fisheries, vegetables and fruits and linking up the rural production centres with the urban and foreign (export) markets to realise higher returns on the investments for the products.

Generally, we divide all economic activities into eight different industrial divisions. They are (i) Agriculture (ii) Mining and Quarrying (iii) Manufacturing (iv) Electricity, Gas and Water Supply (v) Construction (vi) Trade (vii) Transport and Storage and (viii) Services.

This means that in the Indian economy, without generating employment, we have been able to produce more goods and services. Scholars refer to this phenomenon as jobless growth.

Economists call unemployment prevailing in Indian farms as disguised unemployment. What is disguised unemployment? Suppose a farmer has four acres of land and he actually needs only two workers and himself to carry out various operations on his farm in a year, but if he employs five workers and his family members such as his wife and children, this situation is known as disguised unemployment.

Some divide infrastructure into two categories — economic and social. Infrastructure associated with energy, transportation and communication are included in the former category whereas those related to education, health and housing are included in the latter.

Pakistan is ahead of India in reducing proportion of people below the poverty line and also its performance in education, sanitation and access to water is better than India.

Everyone faces scarcity of resources, and therefore, has to use the limited resources in the best possible way to fulfill her needs.

Every society must decide on how much of each of the many possible goods and services it will produce. Whether to produce more of food, clothing, housing or to have more of luxury goods. Whether to have more agricultural goods or to have industrial products and services. Whether to use more resources in education and health or to use more resources in building military services. Whether to have more of basic education or more of higher education. Whether to have more of consumption goods or to have investment goods (like machine) which will boost production and consumption tomorrow.

The curve gives the maximum amount of corn that can be produced in the economy for any given amount of cotton and vice-versa. This curve is called the production possibility frontier.

Thus, there is always a cost of having a little more of one good in terms of the amount of the other good that has to be forgone. This is known as the opportunity costa of an additional unit of the goods.

A market, as studied in economics, is an institution6 which organises the free interaction of individuals pursuing their respective economic activities.

Adam Smith, the founding father of modern economics, had suggested that if the buyers and sellers in each market take their decisions following only their own self-interest, economists will not need to think of the wealth and welfare of the country as a whole separately. But economists gradually discovered that they had to look further.

Economists found that first, in some cases, the markets did not or could not exist. Secondly, in some other cases, the markets existed but failed to produce equilibrium of demand and supply. Thirdly, and most importantly, in a large number of situations society (or the State, or the people as a whole) had decided to pursue certain important social goals unselfishly (in areas like employment, administration, defence, education and health) for which some of the aggregate effects of the microeconomic decisions made by the individual economic agents needed to be modified.

(unemployment rate may be defined as the number of people who are not working and are looking for jobs divided by the total number of people who are working or looking for jobs).

(people who exercise control over major decisions and bear a large part of the risk associated with the firm/enterprise).

(a) there is private ownership of means of production (b) production takes place for selling the output in the market (c) there is sale and purchase of labour services at a price which is called the wage rate (the labour which is sold and purchased against wages is referred to as wage labour).

Depreciation is thus an annual allowance for wear and tear of a capital good.2.

Purchase of consumer goods depends on the capacity of the people to spend on these goods which, in turn, depends on their income.

The subject. The passage from the book. ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, of the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantage’.

‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, of the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantage’.

He prophesied the break down of the peace agreement of the War in the book The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919).

His book General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936) is regarded as one of the most influential economics books of the twentieth century.

(a) contribution made by human labour, remuneration for which is called wage (b) contribution made by capital, remuneration for which is called interest (c) contribution made by entrepreneurship, remuneration of which is profit (d) contribution made by fixed natural resources (called ‘land’), remuneration for which is called rent.

As we have mentioned before, there may fundamentally be four kinds of contributions that can be made during the production of goods and services (a) contribution made by human labour, remuneration for which is called wage (b) contribution made by capital, remuneration for which is called interest (c) contribution made by entrepreneurship, remuneration of which is profit (d) contribution made by fixed natural resources (called ‘land’), remuneration for which is called rent.

We can measure the uppermost flow (at point A) by measuring the aggregate value of spending that the firms receive for the final goods and services which they produce. This method will be called the expenditure method. If we measure the flow at B by measuring the aggregate value of final goods and services produced by all the firms, it will be called product method. At C, measuring the sum total of all factor payments will be called income method.

In other words, the households can decide to spend more – spend beyond their means. And in the end their income will rise exactly by the amount which is necessary to carry out the extra spending. Putting it differently, an economy may decide to spend more than the present level of income. But by doing so, its income will eventually rise to a level consistent with the higher spending level.

Unlike gross value added, net value added does not include wear and tear that capital has undergone.

Notice that change in inventories takes place over a period of time.

Notice that change in inventories takes place over a period of time. Therefore it is a flow variable. Inventories are treated as capital.

Notice that change in inventories takes place over a period of time. Therefore it is a flow variable. Inventories are treated as capital. Addition to the stock of capital of a firm is known as investment. Therefore change in the inventory of a firm is treated as investment. There can be three major categories of investment. First is the rise in the value of inventories of a firm over a year which is treated as investment expenditure undertaken by the firm. The second category of investment is the fixed business investment, which is defined as the addition to the machinery, factory buildings, and equipments employed by the firms. The last category of investment is the residential investment, which refers to the addition of housing facilities.

Net value added of the firm i ≡ GVAi – Depreciation of the firm i (Di).

If we sum the gross value added of all the firms of the economy in a year, we get a measure of the value of aggregate amount of goods and services produced by the economy in a year (just as we had done in the wheat-bread example).

If we sum the gross value added of all the firms of the economy in a year, we get a measure of the value of aggregate amount of goods and services produced by the economy in a year (just as we had done in the wheat-bread example). Such an estimate is called Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Thus GDP ≡ Sum total of gross value added of all the firms in the economy.

Gross value added of firm, i (GV Ai) ≡ Gross value of the output produced by the firm i (Qi) – Value of intermediate goods used by the firm (Zi) GV Ai ≡ Value of sales by the firm (Vi) + Value of change in inventories (Ai) – Value of intermediate goods used by the firm (Zi) (2.1).

Final expenditure is that part of expenditure which is undertaken not for intermediate purposes.

Therefore the aggregate value of output of the economy is Rs 200 (final expenditure received by the baker) + Rs 50 (final expenditure received by the farmer) = Rs 250 per year.

(a) the final consumption expenditure on the goods and services produced by the firm. We shall denote this by Ci.

(b) the final investment expenditure, Ii, incurred by other firms on the capital goods produced by firm i.

(c) the expenditure that the government makes on the final goods and services produced by firm i. We shall denote this by Gi.

(d) the export revenues that firm i earns by selling its goods and services abroad.

RVi ≡ Sum total of final consumption, investment, government and exports expenditures received by the firm i ≡ Ci + Ii + Gi + Xi.

Either they consume it, or they save it, or pay taxes with it (assuming that no aid or donation, ‘transfer payment’ in general, is being sent abroad, which is another way to spend their incomes).

M ≡ Cm + Im + Gm is the aggregate imports expenditure incurred by the economy.

X ≡ denotes aggregate expenditure by the foreigners on the exports of the economy.

G – T measures by what amount the government expenditure exceeds the tax revenue earned by it. This is referred to as budget deficit.

M – X is known as the trade deficit – it measures the excess of import expenditure over the export revenue earned by the economy.

The macroeconomic variable which takes into account such additions and subtractions is known as Gross National Product (GNP).

GNP ≡ GDP + Factor income earned by the domestic factors of production employed in the rest of the world – Factor income earned by the factors of production of the rest of the world employed in the domestic economy.

We have already noted that a part of the capital gets consumed during the year due to wear and tear. This wear and tear is called depreciation. Naturally, depreciation does not become part of anybody’s income. If we deduct depreciation from GNP the measure of aggregate income that we obtain is called Net National Product (NNP). Thus NNP ≡ GNP – Depreciation.

If we measure the GDP of a country in two consecutive years and see that the figure for GDP of the latter year is twice that of the previous year, we may conclude that the volume of production of the country has doubled. But it is possible that only prices of all goods and services have doubled between the two years whereas the production has remained constant. Therefore, in order to compare the GDP figures (and other macroeconomic variables) of different countries or to compare the GDP figures of the same country at different points of time, we cannot rely on GDPs evaluated at current market prices. For comparison we take the help of real GDP. Real GDP is calculated in a way such that the goods and services are evaluated at some constant set of prices (or constant prices). Since these prices remain fixed, if the Real GDP changes we can be sure that it is the volume of production which is undergoing changes. Nominal GDP, on the other hand, is simply the value of GDP at the current prevailing prices. For example, suppose a country only produces bread. In the year 2000 it had produced 100 units of bread, price was Rs 10 per bread. GDP at current price was Rs 1,000. In 2001 the same country produced 110 units of bread at price Rs 15 per bread. Therefore nominal GDP in 2001 was Rs 1,650 (=110 × Rs 15). Real GDP in 2001 calculated at the price of the year 2000 (2000 will be called the base year) will be 110 × Rs 10 = Rs 1,100.

Notice that the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP gives us an idea of how the prices have moved from the base year (the year whose prices are being used to calculate the real GDP) to the current year. In the calculation of real and nominal GDP of the current year, the volume of production is fixed. Therefore, if these measures differ it is only due to change in the price level between the base year and the current year. The ratio of nominal to real GDP is a well known index of prices. This is called GDP Deflator. Thus if GDP stands for nominal GDP and gdp stands for real GDP then, GDP deflator =.

Externalities refer to the benefits (or harms) a firm or an individual causes to another for which they are not paid (or penalised).

Thus if prices of all commodities increase in terms of money which, in other words, can be regarded as a general increase in the price level, the value of money in terms of any commodity must have decreased – in the sense that a unit of money can now purchase less of any commodity.

Thus if prices of all commodities increase in terms of money which, in other words, can be regarded as a general increase in the price level, the value of money in terms of any commodity must have decreased – in the sense that a unit of money can now purchase less of any commodity. We call it a deterioration in the purchasing power of money.

Consider, next, a two-person economy consisting of two entities – a firm (owned by one person) and a worker. The firm pays the worker a salary of Rs 100 at the beginning of every month. The worker, in turn, spends this income over the month on the output produced by the firm – the only good available in this economy! Thus, at the beginning of each month the worker has a money balance of Rs 100 and the firm a balance of Rs 0. On the last day of the month the picture is reversed – the firm has gathered a balance of Rs 100 through its sales to the worker. The average money holding of the firm as well as the worker is equal to Rs 50 each. Thus the total transaction demand for money in this economy is equal to Rs 100. The total volume of monthly transactions in this economy is Rs 200 – the firm has sold its output worth Rs 100 to the worker and the latter has sold her services worth Rs 100 to the firm. The transaction demand for money of the economy is again a fraction of the total volume of transactions in the economy over the unit period of time.

If supply of money in the economy increases and people purchase bonds with this extra money, demand for bonds will go up, bond prices will rise and rate of interest will decline. In other words, with an increased supply of money in the economy the price you have to pay for holding money balance, viz. the rate of interest, should come down.

However, coins are issued by the Government of India.

Every currency note bears on its face a promise from the Governor of RBI that if someone produces the note to RBI, or any other commercial bank, RBI will be responsible for giving the person purchasing power equal to the value printed on the note.

Cheques drawn on savings or current accounts, however, can be refused by anyone as a mode of payment. Hence, demand deposits are not legal tenders.

The currency deposit ratio (cdr) is the ratio of money held by the public in currency to that they hold in bank deposits. cdr = CU/DD.

The first instrument is the Cash Reserve Ratio which specifies the fraction of their deposits that banks must keep with RBI.

There is another tool called Statutory Liquidity Ratio which requires the banks to maintain a given fraction of their total demand and time deposits in the form of specified liquid assets. Apart from these ratios RBI uses a certain interest rate called the Bank Rate to control the value of rdr.

Commercial Banks accept deposits from the public and lend out this money to interest earning investment projects.

Commercial Banks accept deposits from the public and lend out this money to interest earning investment projects. The rate of interest offered by the bank to deposit holders is called the ‘borrowing rate’ and the rate at which banks lend out their reserves to investors is called the ‘lending rate’. The difference between the two rates, called ‘spread’, is the profit that is appropriated by the banks. Deposits.

The creditworthiness of a person is judged by her current assets or the collateral (a security pledged for the repayment of a loan) she can offer.

If all the account-holders of all commercial banks in the country want their deposits back at the same time, the banks will not have enough means to satisfy the need of every account-holder and there will be bank failures.

This role of the monetary authority is known as the lender of last resort.

Apart from acting as a banker to the commercial banks, RBI also acts as a banker to the Government of India, and also, to the state governments.

A low (or high) bank rate encourages banks to keep smaller (or greater) proportion of their deposits as reserves, since borrowing from RBI is now less (or more) costly than before. As a result banks use a greater (or smaller) proportion of their resources for giving out loans to borrowers or investors, thereby enhancing (or depressing) the multiplier process via assisting.

A high (or low) value of CRR or SLR helps increase (or decrease) the value of reserve deposit ratio, thus diminishing (or increasing) the value of the money multiplier and money supply in the economy in a similar fashion.

The basic objective of macroeconomics is to develop theoretical tools, called models, capable of describing the processes which determine the values of these variables.

This is a stylisation typical of almost any theoretical exercise and is called the assumption of ceteris paribus, which literally means ‘other things remaining equal’.

This example, in a nutshell, demonstrates the philosophical point underlying macroeconomic analysis that ‘the sum of the parts is not equal to the whole’. Even if we study individual decision making processes regarding how much to save-which is primarily a subject matter of macroeconomic analysis, we are unable to theorise what is happening to aggregate savings in the economy. Apparently, the determinants of aggregate savings is not just the sum total of factors influencing individual saving decisions, but something more than that.

The rate of increase in ex ante consumption due to a unit increment in income is called marginal propensity to consume.

First, certain goods, referred to as public goods (such as national defence, roads, government administration), as distinct from private goods (like clothes, cars, food items), cannot be provided through the market mechanism, i.e. by transactions between individual consumers and producers and must be provided by the government. This is the allocation function.

Second, through its tax and expenditure policy, the government attempts to bring about a distribution of income that is considered ‘fair’ by society. The government affects the personal disposable income of households by making transfer payments and collecting taxes and, therefore, can alter the income distribution. This is the distribution function.

Third, the economy tends to be subject to substantial fluctuations and may suffer from prolonged periods of unemployment or inflation. The overall level of employment and prices in the economy depends upon the level of aggregate demand which is a function of the spending decisions of millions of private economic agents apart from the government. These decisions, in turn, depend on many factors such as income and credit availability. In any period, the level of expenditures may not be sufficient for full utilisation of labour and other resources of the economy. Since wages and prices are generally rigid downwards (they do not fall below a level), employment cannot be restored automatically. Hence, policy measures are needed to raise aggregate demand. On the other hand, there may be times when expenditures exceed the available output under conditions of high employment and thus may cause inflation. In such situations, restrictive conditions are needed to reduce demand. These constitute the stabilisation requirements of the domestic economy. To understand the need for governmental provision of public goods, we must consider what distinguishes them from private goods. There are two major differences. One, the benefits of public goods are not limited to one particular consumer, as in the case of private goods, but become available to all. For instance, if a person consumes a chocolate or wears a shirt, these will not be available to other individuals. This person’s consumption stands in a rival relationship to the consumption of others. However,.

Further, the budget must distinguish expenditure on the revenue account from other expenditures. Therefore, the budget comprises of the (a) Revenue Budget and the (b) Capital Budget (Refer.

The Revenue Budget shows the current receipts of the government and the expenditure that can be met from these receipts.

And indirectly from commercial banks through Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR).

By borrowing, the government transfers the burden of reduced consumption on future generations. This is because it borrows by issuing bonds to the people living at present but may decide to pay off the bonds some twenty years later by raising taxes.

Foreign economic agents will accept a national currency only if they are convinced that the currency will maintain a stable purchasing power.

At the international level, there is no single currency that is issued by a central authority. Foreign economic agents will accept a national currency only if they are convinced that the currency will maintain a stable purchasing power. Without this confidence, a currency will not be used as an international medium of exchange and unit of account since there is no international authority with the power to force the use of a particular currency in international transactions. Governments have tried to gain confidence of potential users by announcing that the national currency will be freely convertible at a fixed price into another asset, over whose value the issuing authority has no control. This other asset most often has been gold, or other national currencies.

The balance of payments (BoP) record the transactions in goods, services and assets between residents of a country with the rest of the world for a specified time period typically a year.


# Elon Musk (Ashlee Vance)

The poster to the left depicts Mars as it is today—a cold, barren red orb. The poster on the right shows a Mars with a humongous green landmass surrounded by oceans. The planet has been heated up and transformed to suit humans. Musk fully intends to try and make this happen. Turning humans into space colonizers is his stated life’s purpose.

He’s the guy with the electric cars, solar panels, and rockets peddling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P. T. Barnum who has gotten extraordinarily rich by preying on people’s fear and self-hatred.

Insanity of business in these times are well-known. You no longer had to make something that other people wanted to buy in order to start a booming company.

Insanity of business in these times are well-known. You no longer had to make something that other people wanted to buy in order to start a booming company. You just had to have an idea for some sort of Internet thing and announce it to the world in order for eager investors to fund your thought experiment. The whole goal was to make as much money as possible in the shortest amount of time because everyone knew on at least a subconscious level that reality had to set in eventually.

Pumping out simple apps and advertisements. “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,”.

“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,”.

“We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters”.

The conventional wisdom of the time said to take a deep breath and wait for the next big thing to arrive in due course. Musk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity.

Musk’s vision, and, of late, execution seem to combine the best of Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller.

Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to . . . well . . . save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.

“I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,” Musk said. “I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to ten—how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe ten hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. “He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” he said.

“To him, that was all just anticipated,” said Scott Haldeman. “We were left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just have to make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very proud of Elon.”.

Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, grew up idolizing her parents. In her youth, she was considered a nerd. She liked math and science and did well at the coursework. By the age of fifteen, however, people had taken notice of some of her other attributes. Maye was gorgeous. Tall with ash-blond hair, Maye had the high cheekbones and angular features that would make her stand out anywhere.

Maye tells the story of Elon playing outside one night with his siblings and cousins. When one of them complained of being frightened by the dark, Elon pointed out that “dark is merely the absence of light,” which did little to reassure the scared child. As a youngster, Elon’s constant yearning to correct people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his feelings of isolation.

(He picked Queen’s over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good-looking women at Queen’s.).

“One night he told me, ‘If there was a way that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat. I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.’ The enormity of his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out. It seemed like one of the more unusual things I had ever heard.”.

“Somebody had to stay sober during these parties,”.

“Elon was the most straight-laced dude you have ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing.” The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk’s behavior came during video game binges that could go on for days.

As the story goes, Musk dropped out of Stanford after two days, finding the Internet’s call irresistible. He talked Kimbal into moving to Silicon Valley as well, so they could conquer the Web together.

All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did. If everyone else ran off a bloody cliff, they’d run right off a cliff with them. If there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was.

“He’s willing to take an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.”.

Anyone who tries to build a car company in the United States is quickly reminded that the last successful start-up in the industry was Chrysler, founded in 1925. Designing and building a car from the ground up comes with plenty of challenges, but it’s really getting the money and know-how to build lots of cars that has thwarted past efforts to get a new company going.

“There’s no such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they wouldn’t try to be a public figure.”.

He’s built an engineering army by having the pick of just about anyone in the business that SpaceX wants.

The SpaceX hiring model places some emphasis on getting top marks at top schools. But most of the attention goes toward spotting engineers who have exhibited type A personality traits over the course of their lives. The company’s recruiters look for people who might excel at robot-building competitions or who are car-racing hobbyists who have built unusual vehicles. The object is to find individuals who ooze passion, can work well as part of a team, and have real-world experience bending metal. “Even if you’re someone who writes code for your job, you need to understand how mechanical things work,” said Dolly Singh, who spent five years as the head of talent acquisition at SpaceX. “We were looking for people that had been building things since they were little.”.

They’re asked to write an essay for Musk about why they want to work at SpaceX.

“You’re standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you?”.

That’s when Musk will follow with “Where else could you be?” The other answer is somewhere close to the South Pole where, if you walk one mile south, the circumference of the Earth becomes one mile. Fewer engineers get this answer, and Musk will happily walk them through that riddle and others and cite any relevant equations during his explanations. He tends to care less about whether or not the person gets the answer than about how they describe the problem and their approach to solving it.

Where a typical manager may set the deadline for the employee, Musk guides his engineers into taking ownership of their own delivery dates. “He doesn’t say, ‘You have to do this by Friday at two P.M.,’” Brogan said. “He says, ‘I need the impossible done by Friday at two P.M. Can you do it?’ Then, when you say yes, you are not working hard because he told you to. You’re working hard for yourself. It’s a distinction you can feel. You have signed up to do your own work.” And by recruiting hundreds of bright, self-motivated people, SpaceX has maximized the power of the individual.

And the absolute worst thing that someone can do is inform Musk that what he’s asking is impossible. An employee could be telling Musk that there’s no way to get the cost on something like that actuator down to where he wants it or that there is simply not enough time to build a part by Musk’s deadline. “Elon will say, ‘Fine. You’re off the project, and I am now the CEO of the project. I will do your job and be CEO of two companies at the same time. I will deliver it,’” Brogan said. “What’s crazy is that Elon actually does it. Every time he’s fired someone and taken their job, he’s delivered on whatever the project was.”.

“It’s like he has everyone working on this car that is meant to get from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas,” this executive said. “They will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when they set off for New York after that year, all of the vice presidents think privately that the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas. What ends up happening is that the car gets to New Mexico—twice as far as they ever expected—and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out of people.”.

Don’t think we’re doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do,” Page said. “I think like we’re just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a.

“I don’t think we’re doing a good job as a society deciding what things are really important to do,” Page said. “I think like we’re just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leadership training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don’t think most people are doing that, and it’s a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you’re able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. I think that’s really an important thing for the world. That’s how we make progress.”.

“Elon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is short,” Straubel said. “If you really embrace this, it leaves you with the obvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as you can.”.


# Economics in One Lesson (Henry Hazlitt)

This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.

The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond.

The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and indirect consequences. The bad economist sees only what the effect of a given policy has been or will be on one particular group; the good economist inquires also what the effect of the policy will be on all groups. The distinction may seem.

The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and indirect consequences. The bad economist sees only what the effect of a given policy has been or will be on one particular group; the good economist inquires also what the effect of the policy will be on all groups.

Today is already the tomorrow which the bad economist yesterday urged us to ignore.

The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.

Bad economists present their errors to the public better than the good economists present their truths.

The needs of India today are incomparably greater than the needs of America. But its purchasing power, and therefore the “new business” that it can stimulate, are incomparably smaller.

But the more money is turned out in this way, the more the value of any given unit of money falls. This falling value can be measured in rising prices of commodities.

But this does not mean that property destruction is an advantage to the person whose property has been destroyed. No man burns down his own house on the theory that the need to rebuild it will stimulate his energies.

No ordinary misfortune, no ordinary misgovernment, will do so much to make a nation wretched as the constant progress of physical knowledge and the constant effort of every man to better himself will do to make a nation prosperous.

Increases total “demand” forget that demand and supply are merely two sides of the same coin. They are the same thing looked at from different directions. Supply.

Those who think that the destruction of war increases total “demand” forget that demand and supply are merely two sides of the same coin. They are the same thing looked at from different directions. Supply creates demand because at bottom it is demand. The supply of the thing they make is all that people have, in fact, to offer in exchange for the things they want. In this sense the farmers’ supply of wheat constitutes their demand for automobiles and other goods. All this is inherent in the modern division of labor and in an exchange economy.

To look at the debit side of the ledger.

The government spenders create the very problem of unemployment that they profess to solve.

What is put into the hands of B cannot be put into the hands of A.

The government lenders, on the other hand, are either those who have passed civil service examinations, and know how to answer hypothetical questions hypothetically, or they are those who can give the most plausible reasons for making loans and the most plausible explanations of why it wasn’t their fault that the loans failed. But the net result remains: private loans will utilize existing resources and capital far better than government loans. Government loans will waste far more capital and resources than private loans. Government loans, in short, as compared with private loans, will reduce production, not increase it.

When the government makes loans or subsidies to business, what it does is to tax successful private business in order to support unsuccessful private business.

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. The Technocrats.

When your money is taken by a thief, you get nothing in return. When your money is taken through taxes to support needless bureaucrats, precisely the same situation exists.

When we can find no better argument for the retention of any group of officeholders than that of retaining their purchasing power, it is a sign that the time has come to get rid of.

THE ECONOMIC GOAL of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest results with the least effort.

It is for this reason that men began putting burdens on the backs of mules instead of on their own; that they went on to invent the wheel and the wagon, the railroad and the motor truck. It is for this reason that men used their ingenuity to develop a hundred thousand labor-saving inventions.

THE ECONOMIC GOAL of any nation, as of any individual, is to get the greatest results with the least effort. The whole economic progress of mankind has consisted in getting more production with the same labor. It is for this reason that men began putting burdens on the backs of mules instead of on their own; that they went on to invent the wheel and the wagon, the railroad and the motor truck. It is for this reason that men used their ingenuity to develop a hundred thousand labor-saving inventions.

Nothing is easier to achieve than full employment, once it is divorced from the goal of full production and taken as an end in itself.

Everywhere the means is erected into the end, and the end itself is forgotten.

Wages and employment are discussed as if they had no relation to productivity and output.

Government should make huge loans to foreign countries for the sake of increasing our exports, regardless of whether or not these loans are likely to be.

Collectively considered, the real reason a country needs exports is to pay for its imports.

Today we find the government trying to force conversion from oil consumption back to coal.

One is to contend that the X industry is already “overcrowded,” and to try to prevent other firms or workers from getting into it. The other is to argue that the X industry needs to be supported by a direct subsidy from the government.

We do the same thing, however, when we try to prevent any industry from dying in order to protect the labor already trained or the capital already invested in it. Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow. The first process is essential to the second. It is as foolish to try to preserve obsolescent industries as to try to preserve obsolescent methods of production: this is often, in fact, merely two ways of describing the same thing. Improved methods of production must constantly supplant obsolete methods, if both old needs and new wants are to be filled by better commodities and better means.

THE WHOLE ARGUMENT of this book may be summed up in the statement that in studying the effects of any given economic proposal we must trace not merely the immediate results but the results in the long run, not merely the primary consequences but the secondary consequences, and not merely the effects on some special group but the effects on everyone.

The scientists, the efficiency experts, the engineers, the technicians, have solved it. They could turn out almost anything you cared to mention in huge and practically unlimited amounts. But, alas, the world is not ruled by the engineers, thinking only of production, but by the businessmen, thinking only of profit.

The scientists, the efficiency experts, the engineers, the technicians, have solved it. They could turn out almost anything you cared to mention in huge and practically unlimited amounts. But, alas, the world is not ruled by the engineers, thinking only of production, but by the businessmen, thinking only of profit. The businessmen give their orders to the engineers, instead of vice versa. These businessmen will turn out any object as long as there is a profit in doing so, but the moment there is no longer a profit in making that article, the wicked businessmen will stop making it, though many people’s wants are unsatisfied, and the world is crying for more goods.

Only at the expense of all other occupations.

How is the problem of alternative applications of labor and capital, to meet thousands of different needs and wants of different urgencies, solved in such a society? It is solved precisely through the price system. It is solved through the constantly changing interrelationships of costs of production, prices and profits.

Now in an economy in equilibrium, a given industry can expand only at the expense of other industries.

One industry can be expanded only by diverting to it labor, land and capital that would otherwise be employed in other industries.

By implication they put the blame for higher prices on the greed and rapacity of businessmen, instead of on the inflationary monetary policies of the officeholders themselves.

The first is to increase the demand for that commodity. Because the commodity is cheaper, people are both tempted to buy, and can afford to buy, more of it. The second consequence is to reduce the supply of that commodity. Because people buy more, the accumulated supply is more quickly taken from the shelves of merchants.

What is forgotten is that subsidies are paid for by someone, and that no method has been discovered by which the community gets something for nothing.

Each one of us, in brief, has a multiple economic personality. Each one of us is producer, taxpayer, consumer. The policies he advocates depend upon the particular aspect under which he thinks of himself at the moment.

As a producer he wants inflation (thinking chiefly of his own services or product); as a consumer he wants price ceilings (thinking chiefly of what he has to pay for the products of others). As a consumer he may advocate or acquiesce in subsidies; as a taxpayer he will resent paying them. Each person is likely to think that he can so manage the political forces that he can benefit from a rise for his own product (while his raw material costs are legally held down) and at the same time benefit as a consumer from price control. But the overwhelming majority will be deceiving themselves.

Functional prices are those that encourage the largest volume of production and the largest volume of sales.

Functional wages are those that tend to bring about the highest volume of employment and the largest real payrolls.

Therefore any attempt to force prices either above or below their equilibrium levels (which are the levels toward which a free market constantly tends to bring them) will act to reduce the volume of employment and production below what it would otherwise have been.

Volume of production and the largest volume of sales. The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment and the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but.

The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment and the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.

If we try to run the economy for the benefit of a single group or class, we shall injure or destroy all groups, including the members of the very class for whose benefit we have been trying to run it. We must run the economy for everybody.

Contrary to a popular impression, profits are achieved not by raising prices, but by introducing economies and efficiencies that cut costs of production.

The price charged by all firms for the same commodity or service must be the same; those who try to charge a higher price do not find buyers.

The price charged by all firms for the same commodity or service must be the same; those who try to charge a higher price do not find buyers. Therefore the largest profits go to the firms that have achieved the lowest costs of production.

Greater profit goes, of course, to the man who makes a better mousetrap than his neighbor as well as to the man who makes one more efficiently.

Either they never stop to remind themselves that people collectively cannot buy twice as much goods as before unless twice as much goods are produced, or they imagine that the only thing that holds down an indefinite increase in production is not a shortage of manpower, working hours or productive capacity, but merely a shortage of monetary demand: if people want the goods, they assume, and have the money to pay for them, the goods will almost automatically be produced.

The value of the total quantity of money multiplied by its “velocity of circulation” must always be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods bought.

I do not make all the things I consume but, perhaps, only one of them. With the income I derive from making this one commodity, or rendering this one service, I buy all the rest. I wish the price of everything I buy to be low, but it is in my interest for the price of the commodity or services that I have to sell to be high. Therefore, though I wish to see abundance in everything else, it is in my interest for scarcity to exist in the very thing that it is my business to supply.

# Fire on the Horizon (Tom Shroder)

I was aware that it’s not the dangers you anticipate but rather the unforeseen failures that most often give birth to a catastrophe.

If anyone had told me ten years earlier that I would come to love life offshore, I’d have laughed. But I had discovered a reality that few understand or appreciate: the offshore oil field is a magic place where people pit technology against nature to accomplish impossible tasks. It’s a place that more often than not rewards hard work, intelligence, and determination; where degrees and résumés don’t matter; where even a high school diploma is not necessary to lead divisions of men and women.

He had just been to the crew meeting where one of the guys, calling home after a late shift, got word of a blowout on a rig, owned by the world’s largest offshore drilling company, Transocean Ltd., named the Deepwater Horizon.

Whatever your politics, or your feelings about the use of fossil fuels, the fact remains that the world continues to need and demand immense quantities of oil, and in the end, we all rely on these crews of strong, skilled, and determined men and women to bring it home. It’s our obligation to also understand the risks and the pitfalls they face in doing so.

There wasn’t anything he could do about any of it, except sit and watch the flames consume the Horizon. There was nothing to do now but witness her death, just as he had witnessed her birth.

He wasn’t married, so the schedule of twenty-one days on and twenty-one days off didn’t present any family problems, and the rig’s atmosphere—the smell of burning diesel and the constant grind of heavy equipment, the hierarchical command structure—all reminded him of the military.

Roughnecks were pushed hard twelve hours a day by the drillers, who weren’t always picky about their motivational techniques. With the sun beating down hard and no protection from the wind and rain—coupled with the scuffs and bruises of constant manual labor—most roughnecks had the physical proof of their position after a couple of years. Some remained in that job much longer than it took for the skin of their necks to coarsen, but Jason was smart and motivated.

The Deepwater Horizon was to be the first of a new generation of semi-submersibles, the fifth. Previous generations had been inching toward what, in the Horizon, had become almost total computer control of all the rig’s critical functions. On a skeleton of steel and concrete, designers had threaded a web of electric cable that branched out across every surface and bristled with sensors that reported back to computers in the rig’s control centers. This was the rig’s nervous system, and the computers, ordinary PCs, were the brain. The real power was in the software, among the world’s most advanced, capable of considering the millions of data points flooding from the thousands of sensors and instantly interpreting and applying that information to make intelligent decisions concerning the rig’s performance. In addition to registering changes in position, current, and wind for the dynamic positioning system, the sensors alerted the computer to every broken hatch, clogged pipe, overheated engine, and burned-out bulb, every yee and yaw of the drilling platform, each sniffle and sneeze of the ventilation system. It automatically closed hatches to seal out gas-contaminated air, shut down electrical systems to avoid dangerous sparks or risk of electrocution, and sounded evacuation alarms. The builders boasted that these new systems would make the Deepwater Horizon the safest rig ever floated.

There’s a maritime saying that in rough weather, a sailor needs one hand for himself, and one for the ship.

Life, no matter how abundant, ends in death. Every death, no matter how small, is significant.

Contrary to popular myth (and oil company logos), dinosaurs only ruled certain terrestrial neighborhoods of earth—and their corpses didn’t turn into oil.

In many ways the most significant impact on the planet has always been from the smallest life-forms, not the largest.

Microorganisms produced the oxygen that transformed the earth’s atmosphere. And microorganisms are largely responsible for the formation of oil and natural gas deposits, the burning of which is altering the atmosphere once again.

The winner, a BP employee with a literary bent, came up with the name Macondo, after the fictional town created by Gabriel García Márquez and the setting of his masterpiece of magical realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude.

The plan called for the prospect to be drilled in 4,992 feet of water, to a depth 14,569 feet below the ocean floor.

Between the high pressures found deep in the earth, and the explosiveness and toxicity of the payload, poking a steel straw into an oil deposit that had slumbered peacefully for millions of years could turn ugly fast.

There had been a failure to remain vigilant about pressure changes within the well, and a lack of clarity on how to control them. They emphasized that a sense of “complacency” at the end of a well could lead to disaster. They also noted that the blowout had cost them eleven days of work, more than $8 million, and a “significant loss of reputation.” The last thing anyone wanted, they all agreed, was for the same mistakes to lead to a far bigger catastrophe.

It was an ancient story. Flirtation turned into love, love turned into commitment, and a spirited young man found himself making a career and a family instead of another blender of lime daiquiris.

Sailors like to talk about how “salty” something is. It’s simple mariner bravado but, roughly translated, a person or an object is salty to the degree it is linked to the great seafaring traditions reaching across the ages to the Phoenicians, and beyond. Sea beards are salty, black coffee with a pinch of salt is salty, and tattoos of naked mermaids are truly salty. And while plowing through high seas in a midnight gale at ridiculously high latitudes might qualify you as an old salt, spinning circles around a wellhead while the driller calls the shots would certainly not.

Every trip to the rig via helicopter came with another test as well, a test of faith. If you asked rig workers to rank their greatest on-the-job fears, crane accidents, hurricanes, and even blowouts would no doubt rank behind the helicopter commute.

The most important attribute on an oil rig is the ability to work and get along.

Work is the stuff and substance of rig life. Everything is designed to keep the rig working every minute of every day. There are two shifts, each twelve hours a day, seven days a week, with very few breaks. If there’s an ongoing operation on the rig floor, lunch waits. Food is wrapped in tinfoil and put away, devoured when there’s time—even if it’s only five minutes. There are no unions offshore. Only company policy and a supervisor’s goodwill stand between men and exhaustion. If the company wants drillers to work sixteen hours straight, they can make them.

Others, like Dave, spent most of their nonworking, still-conscious time on laptops, chatting with wives or girlfriends, working toward online degrees, starting personal websites.

Most rigs used to have adult channels, but as more women began to arrive, the racier TV fare was purged. Instead, contraband porn DVDs were traded around the rig like baseball cards.

Legend has it that the captain of Transocean’s rig Discoverer Deep Seas, to better demonstrate his elevated status, requisitioned a monster forty-two-inch flat-screen TV that barely fit in his tiny room. Word of the purchase order, approved by the rig manager onshore, leaked out. As soon as the hitch was up, some crew members visited a local florist to order the biggest, gaudiest flower display in the shop, complete with a teddy bear centerpiece and balloons. They sent it to the rig manager with a note that said, “Thank you for the flat-screen TV!” The TV order was promptly canceled.

“Our operations will be conducted in an incident-free workplace—all the time, everywhere.”.

“a START card a day keeps the rig manager away.”.

Someone who is precise but also critical, picky, argumentative, and slow to make decisions. Blue is the color of the feeler, someone who tends to be dependable, agreeable, supportive, and calm, but also reserved, awkward, possessive, and insecure. Curt’s dominant color was yellow—the color for socializers, who, according to the analysis at least, tend to be enthusiastic, optimistic, talkative, persuasive on the upside, disorganized, undisciplined, and at times overconfident on the downside. Curt’s secondary color, red, was common among upper-level supervisors, signifying high ego strength, strong will, a desire for change, but also someone who is pushy, impatient, domineering.

One patch of ocean surface looked the same as another.

To conceive how difficult it is to drop the BOP stack’s connector pipe into the well’s hole, first imagine standing on the observation deck of the Empire State Building and attempting to lower a soda bottle at the end of a 1,200-foot-long string into a garbage can on the sidewalk. It’s extremely windy, and you’re wearing roller skates. Now consider that, with the building encased in clouds, it’s impossible to see the sidewalk, much less the garbage can.

But the first sign of a kick is often seen in the amount of mud that returns. The well bore is filled to the top of the riser with mud. Like a full glass of water held under a faucet, any amount of new mud pumped in should be matched by overflow coming back out. The mud fluid is measured as it goes into the well, pump stroke by pump stroke, and measured again when it comes flooding back out into storage areas called mud pits, which occupy a large portion of the lower deck, just aft of the derrick.

If more mud comes out than was pumped in, that could only mean that something down in the well is pushing back, forcing the mud up and out. That would be the kick. Kicks are fairly common and occur on almost every well. They are nuisances that can become disasters if they aren’t monitored closely and managed adroitly.

Despite its name, mud wasn’t cheap. In fact, it cost far more than refined gasoline, between $200 and $500 per 42-gallon barrel. Formation collapse was called a “lost circulation event” on the rig, because the loss of circulating mud was how it was diagnosed. Thousands of barrels’ worth of mud could escape when a well wall failed, so the mud loss alone could very quickly became a million-dollar problem.

One of his duties as an electronics tech was maintaining the fire and gas detection and alarm system, an extensive network of sensors throughout the rig tied into the rig’s mainframe computer. When he arrived, Mike found it in horrible disarray, with many of the sensors not functioning or locked out. As he set about trying to put things to rights, he stumbled on a page deep in the computer for the rig’s general alarm. He saw that the alarm had been switched to the inhibited mode, which meant it wouldn’t automatically sound if the sensors detected a potentially life-threatening situation. When he reported it, thinking he’d uncovered a serious mistake, he was told that everyone, from the OIM down, wanted it that way, so the crew wasn’t awakened at 3 a.m. for a false alarm. They wanted the watch officers on the bridge, who could see fire/ gas sensor alerts on their computers, to decide if it merited sounding the rig-wide alarm.

Sometimes she wished he didn’t have to work so far away, and stay away so long when he was gone. But she understood, of course. Everybody in rural Mississippi and Louisiana understood.

Janet loved that about her brother, how he could find so much to appreciate in the world. And she loved that he was such a good listener. She always felt safe around him, not just because of his size and his fierce protectiveness, but because she knew he always had her best interests at heart.

“Oh, sis, Scott’s gonna be okay, and you’re a good mother and don’t let anybody tell you any different.”.

Dale put his big bear arm around her and gave her a smile so full of love it made her shiver. He said, “Oh, sis, Scott’s gonna be okay, and you’re a good mother and don’t let anybody tell you any different.”.

And every time the day came for her to drive him to the airport to catch his flight to New Orleans, all the complex calculus of gain and loss would swirl through her mind as another good-bye rushed toward her at sixty miles an hour.

Now he was the OIM, the boss, and the senior drilling hand aboard. Like so many in the Gulf, he was a southerner, born in Mississippi, and a true gentleman, careful to call the men in positions above him, even men years his junior, “Sir,” and all women, regardless of age or position, “Ma’am.” His round face, soulful eyes, and droopy white mustache made him seem approachable, like a favorite uncle. Everyone just called Jimmy “Jimmy,” or “Mr. Jimmy” if they were a junior hand and felt presumptuous addressing the boss by his naked Christian name.

Dewey outlined the final test they would perform to ensure that Macondo was safe, and ready for mud displacement. The procedure was called a “negative test.” In the “positive test” that had been run that morning, pressure had been inserted inside the well casing to see if anything leaked out. The negative test would take pressure off the well, to see if anything leaked in. The test was somewhat complicated and would take some time.

Later analysis indicated that low charge in a battery in the blue control pod and a faulty solenoid valve in the yellow pod rendered the dead man function inactive.

Twenty attempts by Daun and his team to directly force various blowout preventer rams shut using the ROV all failed to stop the.

Long before it crashed into the mud, the riser ruptured and began spewing crude oil into the Gulf at a rate of as much as two and a half million gallons a day.

“But it’s just like with the rig. I think it’s going to happen again in ten years. That’s what humans do, right? They get cautious for a while, and then they forget.”.


# 71 TO 51: My Journey from Failure to IAS & Your Guide to Success (Tripathi, Ila)

It just might happen that you will find your true calling. Civil Services is not the end of the world. But if your inner self, your best wishers tell you, then don’t self-doubt. It’s a good world waiting for you.

And it was only recently that husband dearest confessed that he waited for that one day rather eagerly.

Tell yourself to be prepared for hard work. You should prepare yourself to sacrifice some pleasure in life like parties, hangouts with friends, social media presence etc.

"Nothing else matters, everything else can wait.".

Books, test series, study place is the minimum requirement.

Below is the booklist which is a must for all aspirants: NCERTs: Geography class VI to XII History (old) for Ancient Art and culture- Fine Arts Class XI Economics- Class XI, XII, Economic Survey (for the respective year in which you're to appear for the exam) Polity- Laxmikanth Geography- G C Leong Modern History- Spectrum Environment- Shankar IAS Academy.

Channelise your focus on reading newspaper. As a starting point, develop a habit of reading one of these two newspapers- the Hindu or the Indian Express. Initially editorials will seem  boring and perhaps difficult to understand. Do not let this bother you. Look out for the term(s) you don't understand and then look them up on the internet. To give you an example, in 2015-16 a term called “import cover” would always feature in the Economy section of newspapers. However, no where did any of the newspapers define import cover. Now it is up to you to take the effort of searching the meaning of the term. I did look it up and the term featured in CSE Prelims 2016.

The key to success is to read few books many times rather than many books few times.

But then as they say, if you want to do what you love, do what you should.

Working out, yoga, meditation, practicing your hobby are also good ways to utilise the spare time i.e. post 10 hours.

A non-failing formula to avoid depression is to keep yourself immersed in studies. An idle mind is a devil's workshop.

For Prelims, I would strongly recommend Vision IAS Full Test Series (not subject-wise) and daily Insight IAS MCQs on current affairs. Also, Previous 5 years questions are a must.

This is important because sheet filling up gives an estimate of word limit. For a 10 marks answer, you must fill up 3 sides of papers.

I would also suggest writing two tests on same day with a break of two hours in between. This is how the actual Mains exam schedule is like. So it builds your stamina and your brain is also trained to think in “those” hours only.

These scores are in no way a replica of marks you would score in the actual exam but certainly guide you in terms of whether your preparation is on the track or not.

The missing quality is that they do not revise.

This exam is not a test of how much you know but how well you can apply what you know. Let us say you know ------------. But what you are actually able to recollect and write in the exam is –-. Then what is the point of knowing so much? The best way to apply what you know is to revise what you have read. Instead of reading 100 books, read only 10 ten books but from cover to cover multiple times.

I remember that I would have revised Laxmikanth 12-13 times before Prelims.

Every time I would read, I would find some new information. This was particularly true for chapter 22 on Parliament. I would recommend solving Vision IAS Polity test papers. They are easily available at Flavido (online) or offline shops in ORN but a little later than their online version. Questions in the actual exam are way easier than them but they are useful in revising.

First read it, then understand it and finally write it down in simpler language without compromising on important details.

For example, if you are well-versed with powers of Home Ministry in Union territories and NCT Delhi, you can easily answer questions on stand-offs between state government and LG s- a very common question in GS II.  But if you do not even know what is the jurisdiction of State Government. Merely your opinions do not matter. Therefore, read and revise.

Avoid anything oily as it can make you drowsy but at the same time do not eat too light that you feel hungry in the midst of exam.

Also, pack something to eat for break. The two hour break is considerable time and after the stressful paper I, hunger becomes aggravated.

“I’m confident I will crack Prelims today. I have studied hard. I will do well”.

If you continuously tell it of your failures, your weaknesses, you will become more weak. But if you feed positive thoughts, you will get all that you want. In fact, you can repeat this exercise every night before going to sleep.

The difference between them is the former was over-thinking while the latter was merely minding his business. When you over-think, you give way to negative thoughts and consequently doubt yourself. Whereas the other breed just does their work in the best possible way and leaves the rest. They do not bother about results.

It’s like preparing for marathon and not being able to run sprint. And thus judging your running capability.

All they look for is an honest, diligent person with integrity. Of course,.

All they look for is an honest, diligent person with integrity. Of course, I do possess the afore mentioned virtues. But what is required is also a deep knowledge of your DAF topics.

Having an interest in reading proves instrumental in your bid to become a civil servant.

Your sphere of study resources to a bare minimum. Read only 1 newspaper, 1 online resource and study only 1 credible textbook/notes for any subject.

The importance of getting salary at the end of every month can't be overstated.

Devoting at least 2-3 hours per day towards reading and revising newspaper is a good habit which goes a long way in securing excellent marks in all three stages of the examination.

For instance, if the Government comes up with an important legislation and if you are regular with the newspaper then you will be a witness to its entire journey starting from formulation stage, debate stage and contrasting opinions from entire spectrum of political parties, civil society, public and other stakeholders. Thus reading newspaper is an immersive and enlightening process which magazines can't emulate.

While reading newspaper, focus on front page, national, editorial, international and business section only.

Like you can quote organisations that work in a certain field when a question is asked. For example, UNICEF for infant mortality, WTO for international trade, WHO for global health, Lancet for medicine, Doctors without Borders for migration related issues etc. No one will check it. But it should sound logical. You cannot quote UNICEF for citing reports on birds extinction!.

Remember not all IAS officers are happy and not all happy people are IAS officers.

‘Kev, you and a gun anywhere close to my testicles make me nervous. Hockey doesn’t make me nervous.’.

Of all the things in the world you can be envious of your best friend for, this is what Kevin would most like to have: the ability that Benji has always had to not give a shit about anything, and to get away with it. Kevin shakes his head and laughs in resignation.

That’s both a big and a small thing. Knowing that there are people who will never abandon you.

It’s possible that drink made his words sharper. It’s possible that Peter didn’t mean to slam the door quite as hard as he did. It doesn’t matter now. A young man left Beartown in silence and when he came home again it was too late for words. You can’t look a gravestone in the eye and ask its forgiveness.

All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we’re going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.

You never stop being scared of falling from the top, because when you close your eyes you can still feel the pain from each and every step of the way up.

‘The only time I’m not moving forwards is when I’m taking aim.’.

We become what we are told we are. Ana has always been told that she’s wrong.

A simple truth, repeated as often as it is ignored, is that if you tell a child it can do absolutely anything, or that it can’t do anything at all, you will in all likelihood be proven right.

Sune was like Beartown: a firm adherent of the old faith that no tree should grow too tall, naively convinced that hard work was enough. That’s why the club has collapsed at the same rate that unemployment in the town has rocketed. Good workers aren’t enough on their own, someone needs to have big ideas as well. Collectives only work if they’re built around stars.

‘We play for the bear on the front of our jerseys, not the name on the back.’.

All men have different fears that drive them, and Peter’s biggest one is that he isn’t good enough.

That nothing will work without us. That we’re indispensable. But nothing will happen, the rink will remain standing, the club will live on.

Her back has never been straighter. She could run a thousand miles.

Death does strange, incomprehensible things to loving souls.

‘Pull yourself together, there’s others have got it worse.’.

Good intentions don’t count. Twenty years is too long for him to know how to start the conversation now. Should he apologize? What for? How? His eyes roam across the walls again.

He had meant to call Robbie from Canada; he had meant to call him when he moved home. Good intentions don’t count. Twenty years is too long for him to know how to start the conversation now. Should he apologize? What for? How? His eyes roam across the walls again.

‘And what do we want, Ramona? What can the sport give us? We devote our whole lives to it, and what can we hope to get, at best? A few moments … a few victories, a few seconds when we feel bigger than we really are, a few isolated opportunities to imagine that we’re … immortal. And it’s a lie. It really isn’t important.’.

‘The only thing the sport gives us are moments. But what the hell is life, Peter, apart from moments?’.

Being a parent makes you feel like a blanket that’s always too small. No matter how hard you try to cover everyone, there’s always someone who’s freezing.

For years she used to go to bed dreaming of all the things she was going to do when she got older and had more time, and now she sometimes wakes up in despair in the middle of the night because she can no longer remember what those things were.

Kira sees everything, hears everything, and understands almost everything, but says nothing.

‘Success is never a coincidence. Luck can give you money, but never success,’.

His father’s life is all about the quest for perfection, his whole life a chessboard where he isn’t happy unless he’s two moves ahead of everyone else. ‘Success is never a coincidence. Luck can give you money, but never success,’ he often says.

We devote ourselves to sports because they remind us of how small we are just as much as they make us bigger.

A puck, two goals, hearts full of passion.

A puck, two goals, hearts full of passion. Some people say hockey is like religion, but that’s wrong. Hockey is like faith. Religion is something between you and other people; it’s full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith … that’s just between you and God. It’s what you feel in your chest when the referee glides out to the centre circle between two players, when you hear the sticks strike each other and see the black disc fall between them. Then it’s just between you and hockey. Because cherry trees always smell of cherry trees, whereas money smells of nothing.

Their favourite when they were small was: ‘How do you sink a submarine from Hed? You swim down and knock on the door. How do you sink it a second time? You swim down and knock on the door, because then they open it and say, “Oh no, we’re not falling for that again!” ’ When the guys grew older, their favourite was: ‘How do you know you’re at a wedding in Hed? Because everyone’s sitting on the same side of the church.’ Then they got old enough to tell their own jokes, and David used to leave the locker room more and more. Because sometimes the absence of the coach can also unite a team.

Because there’s something wonderful about making the same noise as everyone around him. He’ll feel ashamed of that for ever.

Hockey is just a silly little game. We devote year after year after year to it without ever really hoping to get anything in return. We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meagre and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That’s all. But what the hell else is life made of?.

‘I’m actually more interested in something veiled in smoke than drowned in coke.

They’re fifteen and seventeen years old, and in ten years’ time they’ll remember this evening, when all the others were inside having a party, and they stood out here and became friends.

Everyone talks about what it’s like. All your life you’re told exactly what happens: you get assaulted on a jogging trail, beaten and dragged into an alleyway on a package holiday, drugged in a bar and locked up by unknown adult men in a slum in a big city. Everyone warns you, time and time again, they warn all girls: this can happen! This is how it happens! It’s just that no one tells you it can be like this: with someone you know. Trust.

Her tears are hot when they leave her eyelids but already frozen by the time they fall from her chin.

To do something stupid, all you need is the opportunity. To do something good, all you need is a reason.’.

‘You need to answer when I call!’ Kevin snarls. Benji’s words come slowly, his eyebrows lower threateningly. ‘I think you must be confusing me with Lyt or Bobo. I’m not your slave. I answer when I feel like it.’.

Man who goes out and grabs what he deserves, or one who stands in a corner waiting for someone to give it to him.’.

A man who goes out and grabs what he deserves, or one who stands in a corner waiting for someone to give it to him.’.

In a few years’ time she’ll read an old newspaper article about research showing that the part of the brain that registers physical pain is the same part that registers jealousy.

The job of GM gave him a chance to live on as part of a team, to build something bigger, something that could outlast him.

A great deal is expected of anyone who’s been given a lot.

‘Community is the fact that we work towards the same goal, that we accept our respective roles in order to reach it. Values is the fact that we trust each other. That we love each other.’.

‘Community is the fact that we work towards the same goal, that we accept our respective roles in order to reach it. Values is the fact that we trust.

‘That most people don’t do what we tell them to. They do what we let them get away with.’.

If Peter has learned one thing about human nature during all his years in hockey, it’s that almost everyone regards themselves as a good team player, but that very few indeed understand what that really means. It’s often said that human beings are pack animals, and that thought is so deeply embedded that hardly anyone is prepared to admit that many of us are actually really rubbish at being in groups. That we can’t cooperate, that we’re selfish, or, worst of all, that we’re the sort of people other people just don’t like. So we keep repeating: ‘I’m a good team player.’ Until we believe it ourselves, without actually being prepared to pay the price.

When you can accept the worst aspects of your teammates because you love the collective, that’s when you’re a team player. And it was Sune who taught him that.

Never again do you find friends like the ones you have when you’re fifteen years old.

How much wouldn’t you love someone who could make you do that at a time like this?.

‘Boys, how do you fit four gays on a chair at the same time? You turn it upside down!’.

One of the first things you learn as a leader, whether you choose the position or have it forced upon you, is that leadership is as much about what you don’t say as what you do say.

No social scientist nor any member of a sports team really knows what makes them who they are, the leaders we follow. Only that we don’t hesitate when we see them.

There’s a town in a forest that loves a game. There’s a girl sitting on a bed playing the guitar for her best friend. There’s a young man sitting in a police station trying not to look scared. In a hallway in a hospital, a nurse walks past a lawyer talking loudly into her cell phone. In the stands in an ice rink in a capital city grown men and women are on their feet, shouting that they are the bears from Beartown, along with sponsors and board members who ten years before laughed at a GM who said that one day they would have the best junior team in the country.

Why does anyone care about sport? There’s a woman in the stands who cares because it’s the last thing she’s got that gives her straight answers. She used to be a cross-country skier at the elite level. She sacrificed all her teenage years to skiing long-distance trails, evening after evening with a headlamp and tears streaming from cold and exhaustion, and all the pain and all the losses, and all the things other high school kids were doing with their free time that she could never be part of. But if you were to ask her now if she regrets anything, she’d shake her head. If you were to ask what she would have done if she could go back in time, she’d answer without hesitation: ‘Train harder.’ She can’t explain why she cares about sport, because she’s learned that if you have to ask the question, you simply wouldn’t understand her answer.

You can get almost anything to look normal if you make enough comparisons.

Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn’t through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.

So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that’s easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe – comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy. There are many ways of doing that, but none is easier than taking her name away from.

That child isn’t the bravest, just the least frightened.

There are damn few things in life that are harder than admitting to yourself that you’re a hypocrite.

What is a Pack?.

‘They just want to show that they’d like to be your friends. It’s hard to say, “Can I be your friend?” It’s much easier to say, “Would you like coffee?” This is a town where people … well … I don’t really know how to explain it. A town where people believe in difficult questions and simple answers.’.

There’s an old saying that Sune loves: ‘What do you call it when a man goes out into the forest and other men follow him? Leadership. What do you call it when a man goes out into the forest alone? A walk.’.

The father’s tears trickle down his daughter’s cheeks.

‘What can I do?’ ‘Love me.’ ‘Always, Pumpkin.’ She nods. ‘Can I ask for something, then?’ ‘Anything.’.

‘Can we go out to the garage and play Nirvana?’ ‘Anything except that.’ ‘How can you not like Nirvana?’ ‘I was too old when they made it big.’ ‘How can you be too old for NIRVANA? How old ARE you?’.

They laugh. How powerful that is, the fact that they can still make each other do that.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We have to get the kids away from here,’ he whispers. ‘We can’t protect them. It doesn’t matter where we are, darling, we can’t protect them,’ she replies. ‘We can’t live like that.’ ‘I know.’ Then she kisses him, smiles, and whispers: ‘But you’re not unmanly. You’re very, very, very manly in lots of other ways. For instance, you NEVER admit that you’re wrong.’.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We have to get the kids away from here,’ he whispers. ‘We can’t protect them. It doesn’t matter where we are, darling, we can’t protect them,’ she replies. ‘We can’t live like that.’ ‘I know.’ Then she kisses him, smiles, and whispers: ‘But you’re not unmanly. You’re very, very, very manly in lots of other ways. For instance, you NEVER admit that you’re wrong.’ He replies into her hair: ‘And you’re very womanly. The most womanly woman I’ve ever met. For instance, you can NEVER be trusted with rock-paper-scissors.’ They laugh, the pair of them. Even on a morning like this. Because they can, and because they must. They still possess that blessing.

‘One day, Zach, you’ll have more money and influence than all those bastards. And then you’ll do great things. Because you know how much it hurts to have no power. So you won’t hurt them, even though you could. And that will make the world a better place.’.

And they don’t have any female friends, and there are no women’s teams here, so they learn that hockey only belongs to them, and their coaches teach them that girls are a ‘distraction’. So they learn that girls only exist for fucking. She wants to point out how all the old men in this town praise them for ‘fighting’ and ‘not backing down’, but not one single person tells them that when a girl says no, it means NO. And the problem with this town is not only that a boy raped a girl, but that everyone is pretending that he DIDN’T do it. So now all the other boys will think that what he did was okay. Because no one cares. Ana wants to stand on the rooftop and scream: ‘You don’t give a shit about Maya! And you don’t really give a shit about Kevin either! Because they’re not people to you, they’re just objects of value. And his value is far greater than hers!’.

The only way to stop being afraid of the darkness out there is to find a darkness inside yourself that’s bigger.

That didn’t teach me not to spill things. It just made me scared of milk. Remember that.’.

‘When I was little, my dad used to hit me if I spilled my milk, Leo. That didn’t teach me not to spill things. It just made me scared of milk. Remember that.’.

Amat is sitting on Zacharias’s bed when his phone buzzes. A single text. A single word. From Maya. ‘Thanks.’ Amat replies with a single word. ‘Sorry.’ The thanks is for what he has done. The apology is for how long it took him to summon the courage to do it.

There are few words that are harder to explain than ‘loyalty’. It’s always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.

Another morning comes. It always does. Time always moves at the same rate, only feelings have different speeds. Every day can mark a whole lifetime or a single heartbeat, depending on who you spend it with.

‘We have to live, Mum. Please. Don’t let him take my family as well, don’t let him take all our lives. I’m never going to be okay, Mum, this is never going to be properly okay again, I’m never going to stop being afraid of the dark, ever again … but we have to start trying. I don’t want to live in a permanent state of war.’.

That you can want to punch a man in the face but still refuse to let anyone hurt his children.

But this is their way of showing that some people in this town can actually carry more than one thought in their head at the same time. That you can want to punch a man in the face but still refuse to let anyone hurt his children.

So David drives home, puts his hand on his girlfriend’s stomach and pretends he’s crying about the baby. His life will be successful, he will achieve everything he’s ever dreamed of – career and success and titles – he’ll coach unbeatable teams at legendary clubs in several different countries, but he will never let any player in any of them wear number ‘16’. He will always keep hoping that Benji is going to turn up one day and demand his jersey.

But, most of all: my children. Thank you for waiting while I wrote this. NOW we can play Minecraft.


# Blues Harmonica For Dummies (Yerxa, Winslow)

The blues is a uniquely American art form that got its start from the collision of African and European cultures in the American South.

The harmonica is one of the most portable instruments in existence. It was the first musical instrument played in outer space, during the early days of space travel, when even an extra ounce of weight was critically important.

In a standard musical scale, a semitone is the smallest move you can measure, like moving one fret on a guitar or moving to the neighboring key on a piano.


# Rich Dad, Poor Dad (Kiyosaki, Robert)

I'm free to do and study what my heart wants to study. . .rather than study something because businesses are looking for certain job skills. If I learn this, I won't have to worry about job security and Social Security the way most of my classmates already do.”.

My poor dad would also say, “I'm not interested in money,” or “Money doesn't matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”.

The Road Not Taken Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;.

Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the.

If you're that kind of person, you'll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old man. You'll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working guy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will know you didn't go for it. You chose to play it safe.”.

“You'd best change your point of view. Stop blaming me, thinking I'm the problem. If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you, it's easier to change yourself than everyone else.”.

First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.”.

Their lives are then run forever by two emotions, fear and greed.

Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets. If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know.

“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are assets”.

“If you want to be rich, you've got to read and understand numbers.”.

An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.

"I don't think you can do it.".

“An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are.”.

We started to understand why our rich dad told us that schools were designed to produce good employees instead of employers.

Number of days forward... or if I stopped working.

Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?.

The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. So how do I start minding my own business? What is the answer? Listen to the founder of McDonald's.

A problem with school is that you often become what you study. So if you study, say, cooking, you become a chef. If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that person rich.

I often sat in his office waiting for him to “get to me.” He was ignoring me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world pushes you around. Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man.

A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of expertise that is so exciting, but not necessary to get into unless you have sizable assets or a business. Employees earn and get taxed and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It's one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They're easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre-tax dollars.

The world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they're • poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not f because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald's does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best at f selling and delivering a basic average burger.

The main management skills needed for success are: 1. The management of cash flow 2. The management of systems (including yourself and time with family). 3. The management of people. The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing. It is the ability to sell--therefore, to communicate to another human being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill of personal success. It is communication skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that I work on constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my knowledge.

The skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people primarily due to their fear of rejection.

I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell.

Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest secret of winners. It's the secret that losers do not know. The greatest secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton's quote, “Winning means being unafraid to lose.” People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of losing because they know who they are. They hate losing, so they know that losing will only inspire them to become better. There is a big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose.

They're busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face.

”Do what you feel in your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.".

“don't wants.” I will list a few. First the “don't wants,” for they create the “wants.” I don't want to work all my life. I don't want what my parents aspired for, which was job security and a house in the suburbs. I don't like being an employee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because he was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for when he died. The rich don't do that. They work hard and pass it on to their children. Now the wants. I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want money to work for me.

In other words, be careful what you study and learn, because your mind is so powerful that you become what you put in your head.

# Essentials of Economics (Faustino Ballvé)

Its fundamental principles, of which those of the present age, aptly called neomercantilist, remind us, are: the direction of economic life by the public authorities, the consideration of money as true wealth, a concern with a favorable balance of payments with the object of obtaining more money in international exchange, the protection of industry for the purpose of having articles of export in order to bring money into the country, a system of subsidies and privileges for exporters and for industries producing for export or avoiding imports, an increase in the population in order to augment the productive forces of the domestic economy, competition with and isolation of foreigners by means of tariff barriers, and, above all, the belief that the prosperity of one country is possible only at the expense of the others.

# Us Against You (Fredrik Backman)

Sometimes people have to be allowed to have something to live for in order to survive everything else. We’re.

Sometimes people have to be allowed to have something to live for in order to survive everything else. We’re not mad, we’re not greedy; say what you like about Beartown, but the people here are tough and hardworking. So we built a hockey team that was like us, that we could be proud of, because we weren’t like you. When people from the big cities thought something seemed too hard, we just grinned and said, “It’s supposed to be hard.” Growing up here wasn’t easy; that’s why we did it, not you. We stood tall, no matter the weather. But then something happened, and we fell.

A parent’s love is unbearable, reckless, irresponsible. They’re so small when they sleep in their beds and we sit beside them, shattered to pieces inside. It’s a lifetime of shortcomings, and, feeling guilty, we stick happy pictures up everywhere, but we never show the gaps in the photograph album, where everything that hurts is hidden away.

A parent’s love is unbearable, reckless, irresponsible. They’re so small when they sleep in their beds and we sit beside them, shattered to pieces inside. It’s a lifetime of shortcomings, and, feeling guilty, we stick happy pictures up everywhere, but we never show the gaps in the photograph album, where everything that hurts is hidden away. The silent tears in darkened rooms.

There’s only one sort of whisky here, but several types of sorrow.

Kira will figure it out soon enough, of course. She’s a smart woman, and she’s lived here long enough. Beartown is known for many things: dizzyingly beautiful forests, a last area of wilderness in a country where national politicians only want the big cities to grow. It has friendly, humble, hardworking people who love nature and sports, spectators who fill the stands no matter what league the team is playing in, pensioners who paint their faces green when they go to games. Responsible hunters, competent anglers, people as tough as the forest and as unyielding as the ice, neighbors who help anyone in need. Life can be hard, but they grin and say, “It’s supposed to be hard.” Beartown is known for that. But . . . well. The town is also known for other things.

People will always choose a simple lie over a complicated truth, because the lie has one unbeatable advantage: the truth always has to stick to what actually happened, whereas the lie just has to be easy to believe.

“It’s only a sports club, there are more important things.” It’s easy to say that sort of thing if you believe that sports is merely a matter of numbers. But it never is, and you can only understand that if you start with the simplest question: How does it feel for a child to play hockey? It’s not so hard to answer that. Have you ever been in love? That’s how it feels.

A sweaty sixteen-year-old is running along the road outside Beartown. His name is Amat. In a garage out in the woods, a dirty eighteen-year-old is helping his dad fetch tools and stack tires. His name is Bobo. In a garden a four-and-a-half-year-old girl is firing pucks from a patio into a brick wall. Her name is Alicia. Amat hopes that one day he’s going to be good enough for hockey to take him and his mother away from here. For him sports are a future. Bobo just hopes he can have another season of laughter and no responsibilities, seeing as he knows that every day after that will be like all his dad’s days. For Bobo sports are a last chance for play. For Alicia, the four-and-a-half-year-old girl firing pucks on a patio? Have you ever been in love? That’s what sports are for her.

Nothing travels faster than a good story.

“Because bears shit in the woods, and everyone else shits on Beartown.”.

Memory loss is one of the finest things sports can give us.

They laughed so much in those pictures. Hugged each other so tightly, loved each other so infinitely. Isak taught Leo an unbearable number of things that day, without even existing. He taught him that love isn’t enough. That’s a terrible thing to learn when you’re seven years old. Or at any age.

Leo is six years younger than most of them; he’s an awful lot smaller and an awful lot weaker, but some of his friends have still started to tell him that he “ought to do something.” That one of those bastards “needs to be punished.” That he has to “be a man.” Masculinity is complicated when you’re twelve. And at every other age, too.

They always are, but when politics work in our favor we call it “cooperation,” and when it favors others we call it “corruption.”.

“A great deal is expected of anyone who’s been given a lot.”.

Peter doesn’t need to hear the rest; he’s heard this vision of the future, he was there when it was written. First the rink and hockey school, then the shopping center and better links to the highway. A conference hotel and a ski competition that gets shown on television. And then who knows? Maybe an airport? Sports are only sports until someone who doesn’t give a damn about sports has something to gain from them;.

Then sports suddenly become economics.

Then sports suddenly become economics. The hockey club was going to rescue the entire council district, and that remains the case. Just not Peter’s hockey club.

Ana dreams of killing Kevin for what he’s done to her best friend, but most of all she dreams of crushing the whole town for what it’s still putting Maya through.

The idiots won’t say it was Kevin who killed Beartown Ice Hockey; they’ll say that “the scandal” killed the club. Because their real problem isn’t that Kevin raped someone but that Maya got raped. If she hadn’t existed, it wouldn’t have happened. Women are always the problem in the men’s world.

Everyone is a hundred different things, but in other people’s eyes we usually get the chance to be only one of them.

There are days when she hates herself for hating that so much. For that not being enough for her, just belonging to someone else. She eats lunch at her desk, surrounded.

There are days when she hates herself for hating that so much. For that not being enough for her, just belonging to someone else.

She eats lunch at her desk, surrounded by pink Post-it notes relating to work and yellow Post-it notes reminding her of things to buy and errands she has to run for various members of her family.

Either you’re the best or you’re everyone else, and the best don’t make excuses, they find a way to win.

People talk about a “winner’s mentality,” because a winner has something that others lack, a special brain that takes for granted that it was born to be heroic.

When everything else is collapsing, you throw yourself into the only thing you know you can control, the only place you feel you know what you’re doing. Everything else hurts too much. So you go to work and hide there, the way mountain climbers dig holes in the snow when a storm hits.

Sune taught Peter what a club is. It’s not something you blame nor something you demand things of. “Because it’s us, Peter, Beartown Ice Hockey is you and me. The best and worst things it achieves demonstrate the best and worst sides of us.” He taught Peter other things, too, such as standing tall both when you win and when you lose, and that the most talented players have a duty to elevate the weakest because “a great deal is expected of anyone who’s been given a lot.”.

Men don’t know their own weight, they don’t understand the physical terror they can instil in another person simply by tumbling through a door. They’re hurricanes tearing through a forest of saplings as they get up drunkenly from the kitchen table and stumble from room to room without being aware of what they’re trampling on.

People with logical minds might think notes like that are silly, but you don’t get to be best at a sport by being logical. You have to be a dreamer. When Peter was in primary school, a teacher asked the pupils what they wanted to be when they grew up. Peter said, “A pro in the NHL.” He can still remember the way the whole class laughed, and he’s spent his whole life proving them wrong. People with logical minds realize it’s impossible for a small boy from little Beartown to play with the best in the world, but dreamers work differently. The only problem is that you’re never finished, you can never prove enough, the people laughing just move the boundaries. There’s a clock on the wall of the changing room; it’s stopped, no one will bother to change the battery. It takes time to learn to love something but much less to kill it: a single moment will do. Sports is merciless: a big star becomes a has-been during a ten-second walk from the ice to the locker room, a club that has survived more than half a century is condemned to collapse during a few minutes in a council building. Peter wonders if they’ll demolish the rink now, build their conference hotel or some other crap the people with money and power dream about. They never love anything, they just own things. For them this is nothing more than bricks and mortar.

The rink in Beartown is closed and dark when Peter gets there. He doesn’t switch the lights on; there are yellowing sheets of paper on the walls, and he knows what they say without needing any light. Small words written in a loud voice: “Team before individual.” Farther away: “The only time we’re not moving forward is when we’re taking aim.” Above that: “Dream—Fight—Win!” And nearest the door, in his own handwriting: “We stand tall when we win, we stand tall when we lose, we stand tall no matter what.” People with logical minds might think notes like that are silly, but you don’t get to be best at a sport by being logical.

Ramona is past retirement age, but no one who values the shape of his nose mentions the fact out loud.

Two drowning people with lead weights around their ankles may not be each other’s salvation; if they hold hands, they’ll just sink twice as fast. In the end the weight of carrying each other’s broken hearts becomes unbearable.

“When you called me, you offered me the job of coach of Beartown Ice Hockey’s A-team. But the club’s going into receivership. And even if it weren’t, it already has a coach. And even if it didn’t, you’re still a politician rather than the club’s general manager, so unless I’ve seriously misunderstood the democratic process, you can’t offer me a job as a coach any more than you can offer me a unicorn.”.

“You’re a very strange person, Zackell.” “So I’ve been told.”.

“That’s because when everyone else runs the same way, I go the other way, Zackell. That’s how I win.”.

Theo’s eyes narrow contentedly. “That’s because when everyone else runs the same way, I go the other way, Zackell. That’s how I win.”.

Her colleague nods seriously. “And sons. And dads, if I’ve drunk enough Fernet.” Kira smiles. Then she blinks slowly and mutters, “Thanks for being here . . .” Her colleague shrugs her shoulders. “The Wi-Fi at home is bad.” Which is rubbish, of course. She’s still at work because she knows Kira doesn’t want to go home early tonight and sit in an empty house waiting for Peter. She doesn’t judge, she doesn’t go on about it, she just stays behind in the only office where the lights are still on.

So Richard Theo has a picture of a stork on the wall of his office to provide him with a daily reminder that whatever is happening isn’t important. The important thing is how you explain it to people.

On Wall Street brokers call an optimistic market with rising share prices a “bull” market, and the slow, remorseless downward movement of the market in a recession is a “bear” market. The idea is that both are necessary, that the conflict between the two keeps the economy in balance.

When everything is going well, when people are happy, the establishment wins. But when people are angry and arguing, people like Richard Theo win. Because for an outsider to win power requires a conflict. But if there’s no conflict? You have to create one. He dials the number of an old friend in London. “Is everyone agreed?” he asks.

When he got home to Beartown, he could have joined any political party, but he chose the smallest, for the same reason he had chosen to start his political career in Beartown instead of a larger city: sometimes it’s more effective to be a big fish in a small pond than a small one in a big pond. Political affiliations and colors were unimportant to.

All sports are silly. All games are ridiculous. Two teams, one ball, sweat and grunting, and for what? So that for a few baffling moments we can pretend that it’s the only thing that matters.

Maya remembers such insignificant things from her childhood. The way her mom laughs when she describes her dad’s style of dress as “plainclothes cop at high school disco.” Or the way her dad shakes the all-but-empty milk carton each morning and mutters, “Welcome to today’s Guinness World Record attempt, where we will try to make the smallest cup of coffee in the world.” The way her mom loses it if there are socks on the floor and the way her dad would like to take anyone who doesn’t wipe the dish rack in front of a war crimes tribunal. The way her mom moved around the world twice for the sake of her dad’s hockey and the way her dad sneaks admiring glances at her mom when she takes business calls in the kitchen. As though she were the smartest, funniest, most stubborn, most argumentative person he’s ever met and that he still can’t quite believe she’s his.

He was asked, “Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?” The mountaineer replied in bemusement, as if the question was ridiculous and the answer obvious, “Because it’s there.”.

He was asked, “Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?” The mountaineer replied in bemusement, as if the question was ridiculous and the answer obvious, “Because it’s there.” Kira understood then, because why had she wanted to go to university when no one else in her family had been? Why had she chosen law when everyone had told her it would be too hard? Why? To find out if she could do it. Because she wanted to climb that damn mountain. Because it was there.

“Grief is the price we pay for love, Ramona. A broken heart in exchange for a whole one.” He.

“Grief is the price we pay for love, Ramona. A broken heart in exchange for a whole one.”.

“I wouldn’t be doing it for the club, you idiot, I’d be doing it for you. When we won silver twenty years ago and you got the puck at the end of the game to take the last shot, do you remember who made that pass?” Does he remember? Everyone remembers. Tails made the pass, Peter missed the net. Tails may feel that they won silver, but Peter just thinks they lost gold. It was his fault. But Tails wipes his eyes with the back of his hand and says quietly, “If I had a hundred chances to do it again, I’d pass the puck to you every time, Peter. I’d sell all my stores for you.

“Men! Imagine if you had periods! You’re incapable of keeping a single bodily fluid inside you in public.”.

“You’re four different women, Kira. You’re trying to be everything to everyone, the whole time. A good wife, a good mother, a good employee. How long are you going to carry on like that?”.

Sune scratches his stomach. As he always says, we only pretend hockey is complicated, because it isn’t really. When you strip away all the nonsense surrounding it, the game is simple: everyone gets a stick; there are two nets, two teams. Us against you.

There’s a loser in every relationship. We may not like to admit it, but one of us always gets a little more and one of us always gives up a little more readily. Kira is sitting on the steps outside the.

There’s a loser in every relationship. We may not like to admit it, but one of us always gets a little more and one of us always gives up a little more readily. Kira is sitting on the steps outside the house,.

There’s a loser in every relationship. We may not like to admit it, but one of us always gets a little more and one of us always gives up a little more readily.

“Hit them in the face,” Sune advises. The four-and-a-half-year-old says she will. You have to keep your promises. But when Sune walks home with her later, he adds, “But you have to be a good friend to the kids who haven’t got any friends. And you have to defend the ones who are weaker. Even when it’s hard, even when you think it’s a nuisance, even when you’re scared. You always have to be a good friend.”.

“Because one day you’re going to be the best. And then the coach will make you team captain. And then you have to remember that a great deal is expected of anyone who’s been given a lot.”.

Yet another season. But she still stands up and says, “What’s love if we aren’t prepared to make sacrifices?” “Darling,.

“What’s love if we aren’t prepared to make sacrifices?”.

“That’s not true . . . please . . . ask me to resign, and I’ll do it!” She doesn’t ask him. She spares him from having to reveal that he’s lying. You do that if you love someone. She says, “I’m one of the people who worship you. And I’m on your team, no matter what. Go and save your club.”.

“I believe taxpayers deserve a society where we don’t have to choose between health care and opportunities for exercise and leisure.”.

“Children take all the things they grow up with for granted.

People say that leadership is about making difficult decisions, unpalatable and unpopular decisions. “Do your job,” leaders are constantly being told. The impossible part of the job is, of course, that a leader can carry on leading only as long as someone follows him, and people’s reactions to leadership are always the same: if a decision of yours benefits me, you’re fair, and if the same decision harms me, you’re a tyrant. The truth about most people is as simple as it is unbearable: we rarely want what is best for everyone; we mostly want what’s best for ourselves.

So he distributes it in small doses, on purpose, because leadership is a matter of manipulating emotions to achieve results.

“Stop it, Mom. You know, I’m so damn proud of your career! Everyone else had a normal mom, but I had a role model. All the other moms have to say to their kids that they can be whatever they want when they’re older, but you don’t have to say that, because you’re demonstrating it every day.”.

“Mom. You taught me that I don’t have to have dreams. I can have goals.”.

“Don’t let the bastards tell you what to be, go your own way, dance badly and sing loudly and become the best!”.

We rarely take out our anger on those who deserve it; we just take it out on whoever is standing closest.

You can get to the top of the mountain and discover that you’re scared of heights.

We don’t always do what we should, but we do what we have to. I get portrayed in the media as dangerous and wicked, simply because I don’t follow all the rules that the establishment has created to stop men like us.

I know that the monster is always at its worst right before you set eyes on it. Our imaginations are always much more terrifying than we’re actually aware of. I think you’ve constructed this Pack of yours the same way. There probably aren’t as many of you as people think. You let people’s imaginations make you more terrible than you actually are.”.

“every large group you don’t yourself belong to is a threat.” There are men in Beartown.

“every large group you don’t yourself belong to is a threat.”.

But there are other things you can’t grow either: parents are a sort of plant you can’t choose, with roots that go deep and catch your feet in a way that only the child of an addict can understand.

Ramona has watched people drink themselves into the gutter for half a century, and she has learned that some children need to see the worst aspects of alcohol so that they leave it the hell alone.

Politics is difficult to understand. Perhaps no one does, not completely. We rarely know why a society’s bureaucracy works the way it does, because it’s impossible to charge anyone with corruption when everything could just as easily be blamed on incompetence.

Richard Theo drives away without feeling evil, merely pragmatic. A man like Teemu Rinnius can affect the way people vote in elections. Theo needs to give him something in exchange. The only thing Teemu cares about is his standing area in the rink. Richard Theo can’t give that back to him unless it’s been taken away from him first.

Few people would have dared to say anything to Benji face-to-face, so they do what people always do: talk about him, not with him. He needs to be dehumanized, turned into an object. There are a thousand ways of doing that, but there’s none simpler than the one we almost always use: taking his name away from him.

“People think a lot of things. They’re far too obsessed with their emotions.”.

Finds himself thinking of a quote by some philosopher: “Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.”.

“Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.”.

“culture isn’t just what we encourage but what we allow to happen.”.

Death does that to us, it’s like a phone call, you always remember exactly what you should have said the moment you hang up. Now there’s just an answering machine full of memories at the other end, fragments of a voice that are getting weaker and weaker. Hog comes into the room and tries.

Death does that to us, it’s like a phone call, you always remember exactly what you should have said the moment you hang up. Now there’s just an answering machine full of memories at the other end, fragments of a voice that are getting weaker and weaker.

Benji throws them into the same garbage can as all the other notes. Because he doesn’t know which feels worst, the threats or the love. The loathing or the expectations. The hate or the responsibility.

“If they hate you, you’re doing something right! You’re the best!.

“If they hate you, you’re doing something right! You’re the best! They’d never hate you this much if you weren’t best!”.

“You’d do that for a few plates of potatoes, girl? What the hell would you have been prepared to do if I’d given you some meat?”.

Grief is a wild animal that drags us so far out into the darkness that we can’t imagine ever getting home again.


# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running (Haruki Murakami)

But I don’t think it’s merely willpower that makes you able to do something. The world isn’t that simple. To tell the truth, I don’t even think there’s that much correlation between my running every day and whether or not I have a strong will. I think I’ve been able to run for more than twenty years for a simple reason: It suits me. Or at least because I don’t find it all that painful. Human beings naturally continue doing things they like, and they don’t continue what they don’t like. Admittedly, something close to will does play a small part in that. But no matter how strong a will a person has, no matter how much he may hate to lose, if it’s an activity he doesn’t really care for, he won’t keep it up for long. Even if he did, it wouldn’t be good for him.

“Muscles are hard to get and easy to lose. Fat is easy to get and hard to lose.”.

Never take two days off in a row. Muscles are like work animals that are quick on the uptake. If you carefully increase the load, step by step, they learn to take it. As long as you explain your expectations to them by actually showing them examples of the amount of work they have to endure, your muscles will comply and gradually get stronger. It doesn’t happen overnight, of course. But as long as you take your time and do it in stages, they won’t complain—aside from the occasional long face—and they’ll very patiently and obediently grow stronger.

If, however, the load halts for a few days, the muscles automatically assume they don’t have to work that hard anymore, and they lower their limits. Muscles really are like animals, and they want to take it as easy as possible; if pressure isn’t applied to them, they relax and cancel out the memory of all that work. Input this canceled memory once again, and you have to repeat the whole journey from the very beginning. Naturally it’s important to take a break sometimes, but in a critical time like this, when I’m training for a race, I have to show my muscles who’s boss. I have to make it clear to them what’s expected. I have to maintain a certain tension by being unsparing, but not to the point where I burn out. These are tactics that all experienced runners learn over time.

People sometimes sneer at those who run every day, claiming they’ll go to any length to live longer. But I don’t think that’s the reason most people run. Most runners run not because they want to live longer, but because they want to live life to the fullest. If you’re going to while away the years, it’s far better to live them with clear goals and fully alive than in a fog, and I believe running helps you do that. Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life—and for me, for writing as well. I believe many runners would agree.

Usually when I approach the end of a marathon, all I want to do is get it over with, and finish the race as soon as possible. That’s all I can think of. But as I drew near the end of this ultramarathon, I wasn’t really thinking about this. The end of the race is just a temporary marker without much significance. It’s the same with our lives. Just because there’s an end doesn’t mean existence has meaning. An end point is simply set up as a temporary marker, or perhaps as an indirect metaphor for the fleeting nature of existence. It’s very philosophical—not that at this point I’m thinking how philosophical it is. I just vaguely experience this idea, not with words, but as a physical sensation.

You’ve done everything you needed to do, and there’s no sense in rehashing it. All you can do now is wait for the race.

You practiced as hard as you could in all that heat, didn’t you? If you can’t make this time, then what’s the point? You’re a man, aren’t you? Start acting like one!.

What I mean is, I didn’t start running because somebody asked me to become a runner. Just like I didn’t become a novelist because someone asked me to. One day, out of the blue, I wanted to write a novel. And one day, out of the blue, I started to run—simply because I wanted to. I’ve always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I’m wrong, but I won’t change.

I look up at the sky, wondering if I’ll catch a glimpse of kindness there, but I don’t. All I see are indifferent summer clouds drifting over the Pacific. And they have nothing to say to me. Clouds are always taciturn. I probably shouldn’t be looking up at them. What I should be looking at is inside of me. Like staring down into a deep well. Can I see kindness there? No, all I see is my own nature. My own individual, stubborn, uncooperative, often self-centered nature that still doubts itself—that, when troubles occur, tries to find something funny, or something nearly funny, about the situation. I’ve carried this character around like an old suitcase, down a long, dusty path. I’m not carrying it because I like it. The contents are too heavy, and it looks crummy, fraying in spots. I’ve carried it with me because there was nothing else I was supposed to carry. Still, I guess I have grown attached to it. As you might expect.


# India's Struggle for Independence (Chandra, Bipan)

Lech Walesa consciously tried to incorporate elements of Gandhian strategy in the Solidarity Movement in Poland. The Indian national movement,.

Lech Walesa consciously tried to incorporate elements of Gandhian strategy in the Solidarity Movement in Poland.

The Indian national movement, in fact, provides the only actual historical example of a semi-democratic or democratic type of political structure being successfully replaced or transformed.

Is the only movement where the broadly Gramscian theoretical perspective of a war of position was successfully practised; where state power was not seized in a single historical moment of revolution, but through prolonged popular struggle on a moral, political and ideological.

It is the only movement where the broadly Gramscian theoretical perspective of a war of position was successfully practised; where state power was not seized in a single historical moment of revolution, but through prolonged popular struggle on a moral, political and ideological level; where reserves of counter-hegemony were built up over the years through progressive stages; where the phases of struggle alternated with ‘passive’ phases.

A major aspect is the values and modern ideals on which the movement itself was based and the broad socio-economic-and political vision of its leadership (this vision was that of a democratic, civil libertarian and secular India, based on a self-reliant, egalitarian social order and an independent foreign policy).

The Rani of Jhansi died fighting on 17 June 1858. General Hugh Rose, who defeated her, paid high tribute to his enemy when he said that here lay the woman who was the only man among the rebels.’.

Displaced peasants and demobilized soldiers of Bengal led by religious monks and dispossessed zamindars were the first to rise up in the Sanyasi rebellion, made famous by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in his novel Anand Math, that lasted from 1763 to 1800.

‘The Hindu meets his religion at every turn. In eating, in drinking, moving, sitting, standing, he is to adhere to sacred rules, to depart from which is sin and impiety.’.

If religion did not keep pace with and meet the demands of the time it would get fossilized as in the case of Islam in India.

Prophets had the same din (faith) and every country and nation had different prophets.

‘our position is not that truths are to be found in all religions, but all established religions of the world are true.’.

Proceedings had to be propagated through newspapers. Interestingly, nearly one-third of the founding.

Interestingly, nearly one-third of the founding fathers of the Congress in 1885 were journalists.

Surendranath Banerjea,.

‘Tilak or no Tilak is not the question. The question is, do you really intend as guardians of the liberty of the Press to allow as much liberty here in India as is enjoyed by the people of England?”.

‘Since you have done me the honour of recalling the trial of the late Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, I just want to say that I consider it to be proudest privilege and honour to be associated with his name.’.

There is the interesting story of Raja Dig Vijay Singh of Balarampur — nominated twice to the Council — who did not know a word of English. When asked by a relative how he voted one way or the other, he replied that he kept looking at the Viceroy and when the Viceroy raised his hand he did so too and when he lowered it he did the same!.

‘Of course it is your speech more than mine and I almost feel I am practicing a fraud on the public in that I let all the credit for it come to me.’.

‘This diamond of India, this jewel of Maharashtra, this prince of workers, is taking eternal rest on the funeral ground. Look at him and try to emulate him.’.

.

The Moderates did not see that the colonial state was negotiating with them not because of their inherent political strength but because of the fear of the Extremists. The Extremists did not see that the Moderates were their natural outer defence line (in terms of civil liberties and so on) and that they did not possess the required strength to face the colonial state’s juggernaut. Neither saw that in a vast country like India ruled by a powerful imperialist nation only a broad-based united movement had any chance of success.

Funds also came from India — Sir Ratan Tata sent Rs. 25,000 and the Congress and the Muslim League, as well as the Nizam of Hyderabad, made their contributions.

‘At my time of life and with views firmly formed on several matters, I could only join an organization to affect its policy and not be affected by it. This does not mean that I would not now have an open mind to receive new light. I simply wish to emphasize the fact that the new light will have to be specially dazzling in order to entrance me.’.

The Philosophy of the Bomb, written by Bhagwati Charan Vohra, Chandrashekhar Azad and Yashpal, defined revolution as ‘Independence, social, political and economic’ aimed at establishing ‘a new order of society in which political and economic exploitation will be an impossibility’.

He fully accepted Marxism and the class approach to society. In fact, he saw himself above all as a precursor and not maker of the revolution, as a propagator of the ideas of socialism and communism, as a humble initiator of the socialist movement in India.

He had pointed out that communal killers did not kill a person because he was guilty of any particular act but simply because that person happened to be a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh.

‘In eighteen years of my reporting in twenty countries, during which I have witnessed innumerable civil disturbances, riots, street fights and rebellions, I have never witnessed such harrowing scenes as at Dharasana.’.

Even though Gandhiji had made every attempt to save their lives, there was anger among the people, especially the youth, as to why he had not refused to sign the Pact on this question.

The Congress Ministers set an example in plain living. They reduced their own salaries drastically from Rs. 2000 to Rs. 500 per month. They were easily accessible to the common people. And in a very short time, they did pass a very large amount of ameliorative legislation, trying to fulfil many of the promises made in the Congress election manifesto.

‘would be denying its own past, falsifying its history, and betraying its future’.


# The Denial of Death (Ernest Becker)

We repress our bodies to purchase a soul that time cannot destroy; we sacrifice pleasure to buy immortality; we encapsulate ourselves to avoid death. And life escapes us while we huddle within the defended fortress of character.

Making a killing in business or on the battlefield frequently has less to do with economic need or political reality than with the need for assuring ourselves that we have achieved something of lasting worth.

Our desire for the best is the cause of the worst.

Consider, for instance, the recent war in Vietnam in which the United States was driven not by any realistic economic or political interest but by the overwhelming need to defeat “atheistic communism.”.

Becker’s radical conclusion that it is our altruistic motives that turn the world into a charnel house—our desire to merge with a larger whole, to dedicate our lives to a higher cause, to serve cosmic powers—poses a disturbing and revolutionary question to every individual and nation. At what cost do we purchase the assurance that we are heroic? No doubt, one of the reasons Becker has never found a mass audience is because he shames us with the knowledge of how easily we will shed blood to purchase the assurance of our own righteousness. He reveals how our need to deny our nakedness and be arrayed in glory keeps us from acknowledging that the emperor has no clothes.

This knowledge may allow us to develop an “objective hatred” in which the hate object is not a human scapegoat but something impersonal like poverty, disease, oppression, or natural disasters. By making our inevitable hatred intelligent and informed we may be able to turn our destructive energy to a creative use.

The script for tomorrow is not yet written.

Prescribes—contemplation of the horror of our inevitable death—is, paradoxically, the tincture that adds sweetness to mortality.

Human beings are naturally anxious because we are ultimately helpless and abandoned in a world where we are fated to die.

“This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression—and with all this yet to die.”.

We achieve ersatz immortality by sacrificing ourselves to conquer an empire, to build a temple, to write a book, to establish a family, to accumulate a fortune, to further progress and prosperity, to create an information-society and global free market. Since the main task of human life is to become heroic and transcend death, every culture must provide its members with an intricate symbolic system that is covertly religious. This means that ideological conflicts between cultures are essentially battles between immortality projects, holy wars.

Our heroic projects that are aimed at destroying evil have the paradoxical effect of bringing more evil into the world.

Cultivating awareness of our death leads to disillusionment, loss of character armor, and a conscious choice to abide in the face of terror.

The man of knowledge in our time is bowed down under a burden he never imagined he would ever have: the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed.

One of the reasons, I believe, that knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction is that it is strewn all over the place, spoken in a thousand competitive voices.

The result is that he often obscures on the one hand what he reveals on the other.

“mankind’s common instinct for reality… has always held the world to be essentially a theatre for heroism.”.

As Aristotle somewhere put it: luck is when the guy next to you gets hit with the arrow.

We should feel prepared, as Emerson once put it, to recreate the whole world out of ourselves even if no one else existed. The thought frightens us; we don’t know how we could do it without others—yet at bottom the basic resource is there: we could suffice alone if need be, if we could trust ourselves as Emerson wanted.

This narcissism is what keeps men marching into point-blank fire in wars: at heart one doesn’t feel that he will die, he only feels sorry for the man next to him.

If you took a blind and dumb organism and gave it self-consciousness and a name, if you made it stand out of nature and know consciously that it was unique, then you would have narcissism.

In man.

But man is not just a blind glob of idling protoplasm, but a creature with a name who lives in a world of symbols and dreams and not merely matter.

Man will lay down his life for his country, his society, his family. He will choose to throw himself on a grenade to save his comrades; he is capable of the highest generosity and self-sacrifice. But he has to feel and believe that what he is doing is truly heroic, timeless, and supremely meaningful. The crisis of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that their culture has set up. They don’t believe it is empirically true to the problems of their lives and times. We are living a crisis of heroism that reaches into every aspect of our social life: the dropouts of university heroism, of business and career heroism, of political-action heroism; the rise of anti-heroes, those who would be heroic each in his own way or like Charles Manson with his special “family”, those whose tormented heroics lash out at the system that itself has ceased to represent agreed heroism.

.

We admire most the courage to face death; we give such valor our highest and most constant adoration; it moves us deeply in our hearts because we have doubts about how brave we ourselves would be. When we see a man bravely facing his own extinction we rehearse the greatest victory we can imagine. And so the hero has been the center of human honor and acclaim since probably the beginning of specifically human evolution. But even before that our primate ancestors deferred to others who were extrapowerful and courageous and ignored those who were cowardly. Man has elevated animal courage into a cult.

Religions like Hinduism and Buddhism performed the ingenious trick of pretending not to want to be reborn, which is a sort of negative magic: claiming not to want what you really want most.

Darwinians thought: early men who were most afraid were those who were most realistic about their situation in nature, and they passed on to their offspring a realism that had a high survival value.

The result was the emergence of man as we know him: a hyperanxious animal who constantly invents reasons for anxiety even where there are none.

As Santayana once put it: a lion must feel more secure that God is on his side than a gazelle.

Mad because, as we shall see, everything that man does in his symbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque fate.

He literally drives himself into a blind obliviousness with social games, psychological tricks, personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of his situation that they are forms of madness—agreed madness, shared madness, disguised and dignified madness, but madness all the same.

“not to be mad would amount to another form of madness.”.

To do all this, and to combine it with an anus that shits! It is too much. Nature mocks us, and poets live in torture.

This is why a woman asks for assurance that the man wants “me” and not “only my body”; she is painfully conscious that her own distinctive inner personality can be dispensed with in the sexual act.

For life is at the start a chaos in which one is lost.

Even the great Carlyle, who frightened many people, proclaimed that he stood on his father as on a stone pillar buried in the ground under him. The unspoken implication is that if he stood on his own feet alone, the ground would cave in under him.

That its task is to discover the strategies that a person uses to avoid anxiety.

Necessity with the illusion of meaning would be the highest achievement for man; but when it becomes trivial there is no sense to one’s life.

He is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, with individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and withdraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret self, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, is the only real problem of life, the only worthwhile preoccupation of man: What is one’s true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In what way is one truly unique, and how can he express this uniqueness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How can the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that he feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings and use them to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and mankind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In.

Even as a young man he was in the habit of taking leave of friends by saying.

Even as a young man he was in the habit of taking leave of friends by saying “Goodbye, you may never see me again.”.

“My death does not terrify me, what terrifies me is the thought of the grief it would cause her.”.

One can’t cope easily with it, but one can cope with someone else’s grief over one’s disappearance.

Instead of experiencing the stark terror of losing oneself as a disappearing object, one clings to the image of someone else. There is nothing complicated in Freud’s use of these intellectual devices.

“Immortality means being loved by many anonymous people.”.

He yearned for fame, anticipated it, hoped that through it he could create his own immortality: “Immortality means being loved by many anonymous people.”.

He yearned for fame, anticipated it, hoped that through it he could create his own immortality: “Immortality means being loved by many anonymous people.” This definition is the Enlightenment view of immortality: living in the esteem of men yet unborn, for the works that you have contributed to their life and betterment.

Why are groups so blind and stupid?—men have always asked. Because they demand illusions, answered Freud, they “constantly give what is unreal precedence over what is real.”.

And we know why. The real world is simply too terrible to admit; it tells man that he is a small, trembling animal who will decay and die. Illusion changes all this, makes man seem important, vital to the universe, immortal in some way.

The masses look to the leaders to give them just the untruth that they need; the leader continues the illusions that triumph over the castration complex and magnifies them into a truly heroic victory. Furthermore, he makes possible a new experience, the expression of forbidden impulses, secret wishes, and fantasies. In group behavior anything goes because the leader okays it.18 It is like being an omnipotent infant again, encouraged by the parent to indulge oneself plentifully, or like being in psychoanalytic therapy where the analyst doesn’t censure you for anything you feel or think. In the group each man seems an omnipotent hero who can give full vent to his appetites under the approving eye of the father. And so we understand the terrifying sadism of group activity.

Leaders need followers as much as they are needed by them: the leader projects onto his followers his own inability to stand alone, his own fear of isolation. We must say that if there were no natural leaders possessing the magic of charisma, men would have to invent them, just as leaders must create followers if there are none available. If we accent this natural symbiotic side of the problem of transference we come into the broadest understanding of it, which forms the main part of the discussion I now want to dwell on.†.

Culture is in its most intimate intent a heroic denial of creatureliness.

The questions about sex that the child asks are thus not—at a fundamental level—about sex at all. They are about the meaning of the body, the terror of living with a body.

The questions about sex that the child asks are thus not—at a fundamental level—about sex at all. They are about the meaning of the body, the terror of living with a body. When the parents give a straightforward biological answer to sexual questions, they do not answer the child’s question at all. He wants to know why he has a body, where it came from, and what it means for a self-conscious creature to be limited by it. He is asking about the ultimate mystery of life, not about the mechanics of sex. As.

If a thinker throws off too many unsystematic and rich insights, there is no place to grab onto his thought.

I remember one of my college professors—a man very much admired as a teacher of medieval history—confessing that the more he learned about the period the less he was prepared to say: the epoch was so complex, so diversified that no general statement could safely be made about it. The same thing can surely be said about the theory of mental illness. How dare someone try to write a chapter entitled “A general view” of such a complex and varied phenomenon—especially someone who is not himself a psychiatrist?.

Now it is time to see that if a man cannot evolve beyond his character, he surely can’t evolve without character.


# Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine (Gail Honeyman)

‘Hi, Raymond here, but also not here. Like Schrödinger’s cat. Leave a message after the beep. Cheers.’.

WHY HIM? WHY NOW? On Monday morning, waiting at the bus stop, I tried to work it out. It was a tricky one. Who can understand the workings of fate, after all? Far greater minds than mine had tried, and failed, to arrive at a conclusion. There he was, a gift from the gods – handsome, elegant and talented. I was fine, perfectly fine on my own, but I needed to keep Mummy happy, keep her calm so she would leave me in peace. A boyfriend – a husband? – might just do the trick. It wasn’t that I needed anyone. I was, as previously stated, perfectly fine.

I feel sorry for beautiful people. Beauty, from the moment you possess it, is already slipping away, ephemeral. That must be difficult. Always having to prove that there’s more to you, wanting people to see beneath the surface, to be loved for yourself, and not your stunning body, sparkling eyes or thick, lustrous hair.

‘Well now, you haven’t always been on your own, have you?’ she said, her voice sly, quiet. I felt sweat cling to the back of my neck, dampening my hair. ‘Still, tell yourself whatever you need to get you through the night, darling,’ she said, laughing. She has a knack for amusing herself, although no one else laughs much in her company. ‘You can always talk to me, you know. About anything. Or anyone.’ She sighed. ‘I do so love to hear from you, darling … You wouldn’t understand, of course, but the bond between a mother and child, it’s … how best to describe it … unbreakable. The two of us are linked for ever, you see – same blood in my veins that’s running through yours. You grew inside me, your teeth and your tongue and your cervix are all made from my cells, my genes. Who knows what little surprises I left growing inside there for you, which codes I set running. Breast cancer? Alzheimer’s? You’ll just have to wait and see. You were fermenting inside me for all those months, nice and cosy, Eleanor. However hard you try to walk away from that fact, you can’t, darling, you simply can’t. It isn’t possible to destroy a bond that strong.’.

Efficacy.’ Raymond rummaged in his duffle coat pocket and.

No, no thank you, you’ve completely and comprehensively resolved my problems.

End, Is there anything else I can help you with today, Eleanor?.

A philosophical question: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?.

I’d very nearly succeeded in erasing him from my memory altogether, so it was rather distressing to be reminded of him.

Sport is a mystery to me. In primary school, sports day was the one day of the year when the less academically gifted students could triumph, winning prizes for jumping fastest in a sack, or running from Point A to Point B more quickly than their classmates. How they loved to wear those badges on their blazers the next day! As if a silver in the egg-and-spoon race was some sort of compensation.

Even his name. Mummy is currently … let’s just say she’s hors de combat.’.

This was both nothing and everything.

Day, to be the recipient of thanks and warm regard! I would never have suspected that small deeds could elicit such genuine, generous responses.

I would never have suspected that small deeds could elicit such genuine, generous responses.

I’d insisted that we meet outside the post office, fearing the reaction of my co-workers were we to be observed leaving work together.

Raymond high-fived him, after some initial awkwardness whereby Sammy had no idea why a podgy hand had been thrust in his face.

Raymond had thrust his into his back pocket. He couldn’t take his eyes off Laura, I noticed, apparently hypnotized rather in the manner of a mongoose before a snake. She was clearly aware of this. I suspected she was used to it, looking the way she did. Blonde hair and large breasts are so clichéd, so obvious. Men like Raymond, pedestrian dullards, would always be distracted by women who looked like her, having neither the wit nor the sophistication to see beyond mammaries and peroxide.

‘I don’t want to talk about me, Eleanor. I already know all about me. I want to talk about you. How.

‘I don’t want to talk about me, Eleanor. I already know all about me. I want to talk about you.

‘Life is all about taking decisive action, darling. Whatever you want to do, do it – whatever you want to take, grab it. Whatever you want to bring to an end, END IT. And live with the consequences.’.

What they fail to understand is that there’s something very liberating about it; once you realize that you don’t need anyone, you can take care of yourself.

But then I realized that he simply didn’t want to arrive alone. Some people, weak people, fear solitude. What they fail to understand is that there’s something very liberating about it; once you realize that you don’t need anyone, you can take care of yourself. That’s the thing: it’s best just to take care of yourself. You can’t protect other people, however hard you try. You try, and you fail, and your world collapses around you, burns down to ashes.

Don’t think I did, anyway …’ ‘People can be … unfathomable,’ I said, stumbling slightly over the word. ‘I often find that I don’t understand why they do and say things.’.

Realized he wasn’t really talking to me; it was like in a play, when a character just talks out loud for no apparent reason. I knew the answer to his question, however.

Cheated on her?’ I realized he wasn’t really talking to me; it was like in a play, when a character just talks out loud for no apparent reason. I knew the answer to his question, however.

He said nothing, and stared with intense concentration at his shoes. Without looking at me, he put out his hand and touched my arm, patted it very tentatively, as one would a horse or a dog (if one were frightened of horses or dogs). He shook his head gently, for a long time, but seemed unable to articulate a response. No matter; I didn’t require one. The whole thing was ancient history now. I was happy being.

At the train station nearest to the party venue. Mirabile dictu,.

I allowed my mind to wander. I’ve found this to be a very effective way of passing the time; you take a situation or a person and start to imagine nice things that might happen. You can make anything happen, anything at all, inside a daydream.

‘indifference’. I felt happy; it was a nice feeling, giving someone a gift, the kind of unique, thoughtful present that he wouldn’t have received from anyone else. He put the carrier bag on a nearby table.

Are you going to take it?’.

Slot into. I wasn’t good at pretending, that was the thing. After what had happened in that burning house, given what went on there, I could see no point in being anything other than truthful with the world. I had, literally, nothing left to lose. But, by careful observation from the sidelines, I’d worked out that social success is often built on pretending.

I had, literally, nothing left to lose. But, by careful observation from the sidelines, I’d worked out that social success is often built on pretending just a little. Popular people sometimes have to laugh at things they don’t find very funny, do things they don’t particularly want to, with people whose company they don’t particularly enjoy. Not me. I had decided, years ago, that if the choice was between that or flying solo, then I’d fly solo. It was safer that way. Grief is the price we pay for love, so they say. The price is far too high.

Communicating by the end of this exchange. It’s both good.

It’s both good and bad, how humans can learn to tolerate pretty much anything, if they have to.

People don’t like these facts, but I can’t help that. If someone asks you how you are, you are meant to say FINE. You are not meant to say that you cried yourself to sleep last night because you hadn’t spoken to another person for two consecutive days. FINE is what you say.

I have always enjoyed reading, but I’ve never been sure how to select appropriate material. There are so many books in the world – how do you tell them all apart? How do you know which one will match your tastes and interests? That’s why I just pick the first book I see. There’s no point in trying to choose. The covers are of very little help, because they always say only good things, and I’ve found out to my cost that they’re rarely accurate. ‘Exhilarating’ ‘Dazzling’ ‘Hilarious’. No. The only criterion I have is that the books must look clean, which means that I have to disregard a lot of potential reading material in the charity shop. I don’t use the library for the same reason, although obviously, in principle and reality, libraries are life-enhancing palaces of wonder. It’s not you, libraries, it’s me, as the popular saying goes. The thought of books passing through so many unwashed hands – people reading them in the bath, letting their dogs sit on them, picking their nose and wiping the results on the pages. People eating cheesy crisps and then reading a few chapters without washing their hands first. I just can’t. No; I look for books with one careful owner. The books in Tesco are nice and clean. I sometimes treat myself to a few tomes from there on payday.

# Principles: Life and Work (Dalio, Ray)

Being “liberal” meant being committed to moving forward in a fast and fair way, while being “conservative” meant being stuck in old and unfair ways—at least that’s how it seemed to me and to most of the people around me.

I also feared boredom and mediocrity much more than I feared failure. For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.

“If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.”.

Meditation has benefited me hugely throughout my life because it produces a calm open-mindedness that allows me to think more clearly and creatively.

I was really getting my head into the livestock, meat, grain, and oilseed markets. I loved them because they were concrete and less subject than stocks to distorted perceptions of value. While stocks could stay too high or too low because “greater fools” kept buying or selling them, livestock ended up on the meat counter where it would be priced based on what consumers were willing to pay. I could visualize the processes that led to those sales and see the relationships underlying them. Since livestock eat grain (mostly corn) and soymeal, and since corn and soybeans compete for acreage, those markets are closely related. I learned just about everything imaginable about them—what the planted acreage and typical yields were in each of the major growing areas; how to convert rainfall levels in different weeks of the growing season into yield estimates; how to project harvest sizes, carrying costs, and livestock inventories by weight group, location, and rates of weight gain; and how to project dressing yields, retailer margins, consumer preferences by cut of meat, and the amounts to be slaughtered in each season.

While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful relationships was far better. To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

Think about it: It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as money has no intrinsic value—its value comes from what it can buy, and it can’t buy everything. It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. Money will be one of the things you need, but it’s not the only one and certainly not the most important one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want.

“Liberal” had ceased to mean being in favor of progress and had come to mean “paying people not to work.”.

“If you are ready to give up everything else and study the whole history and background of the market and all principal companies whose stocks are on the board as carefully as a medical student studies anatomy—if you can do all that and in addition you have the cool nerves of a gambler, the sixth sense of a clairvoyant and the courage of a lion, you have a ghost of a chance.”.

Imagine that in order to have a great life you have to cross a dangerous jungle. You can stay safe where you are and have an ordinary life, or you can risk crossing the jungle to have a terrific life. How would you approach that choice? Take a moment to think about it because it is the sort of choice that, in one form or another, we all have to make.

And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me.

Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion. 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside.

Came to see that people’s greatest weaknesses are the flip sides of their greatest strengths.

“It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.”.

“He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass” is a saying I quoted a lot in those days. Between 1979 and 1982, I had eaten enough glass to realize that what was most important wasn’t knowing the future—it was knowing how to react appropriately to the information available at each point in time.

The most important components to separate were the profits coming from the core business and those that were speculative profits and losses coming from price changes.

I urge you to be curious enough to want to understand how the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way. You will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what you should do.

I had always wanted to have—and to be around people who also wanted to have—a life full of meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that’s open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other. I never valued more traditional, antiseptic relationships where people put on a façade of politeness and don’t say what they really think.

I conducted a time-and-motion study of all of my investment and management responsibilities; it showed it would take me about 165 hours a week to achieve the level of excellence that I would be satisfied with in overseeing both our investments and management. That was obviously impossible. Since I wanted to delegate as much as possible, I asked whether the things I was doing could be done excellently by others, and if so, who those others were. Everyone agreed that most of those areas couldn’t adequately be delegated. I clearly hadn’t done a good enough job of finding and training others to whom I could delegate my responsibilities.

If I changed fast enough to become sustainable at whatever I was doing, then I would build on that to flourish. I’ve always had great faith in my ability to figure things out, and over time my need to figure things out made me better at doing so. As a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way—who would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do about them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our shared mission, they would discover what it took to be successful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right decisions. I knew that micromanaging and handcuffing them wouldn’t work because neither of us would like it. If I was the one telling them what to do, I wouldn’t be getting any leverage from them. Besides, I didn’t want to work with people who needed that.

Worse. It’s tough to be tough on people.

Huge relative to the downside of having it not work out. In the worst case they learn a lot about themselves, have an interesting experience, and leave for other jobs; in the best case, they become a part of an exceptional team achieving exceptional things.

It seems to me that life consists of three phases. In the first, we are dependent on others and we learn. In the second, others depend on us and we work. And in the third and last, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work, we are free to savor life.

“For a long time,” he answered, “I’ve thought that it’s inevitable that something bad is going to happen on a planetary scale—a plague, a meteor—that will require humanity to start over somewhere else, like Mars. One day I went to the NASA website to see what progress they were making on their Mars program, and I realized that they weren’t even thinking about going there anytime soon. “I had gotten $180 million when my partners and I sold PayPal,” he continued, “and it occurred to me that if I spent $90 million and used it to acquire some ICBMs from the former USSR and sent one to Mars, I could inspire the exploration of Mars.” When I asked him about his background in rocketry, he told me he didn’t have one. “I just started reading books,” he said. That’s how shapers think and act.

I gave Wang a copy of Joseph Campbell’s great book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, because he is a classic hero and I thought it might help him. I also gave him The Lessons of History, a 104-page distillation of the major forces through history by Will and Ariel Durant, and River Out of Eden by the insightful Richard Dawkins, which explains how evolution works. He gave me Georgi Plekhanov’s classic On the Role of the Individual in History. All these books showed how the same things.

“Unattainable goals appeal to heroes,” he once told me. “Capable people are those who sit there worrying about the future. The unwise are those who worry about nothing. If conflicts got resolved before they became acute, there wouldn’t be any heroes.”.

In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn’t come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well.

To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is—making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You’d be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for. Just look at people who attain their dreams early—the child star, the lottery winner, the professional athlete who peaks early. They typically don’t end up happy unless they get excited about something else bigger and better to struggle for. Since life brings both ups and downs, struggling well doesn’t just make your ups better; it makes your downs less bad. I’m still struggling and I will until I die, because even if I try to avoid the struggles, they will find me.

I believe that everything that happens comes about because of cause-effect relationships that repeat and evolve over time.

Look to the patterns of those things that affect you in order to understand the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for dealing with them effectively.

Have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the stakes become ever greater.

Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that I’m wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. That has taught me a lot. It has changed my thinking about 1) what’s good and what’s bad, 2) what my purpose in life is, and 3) what I should do when faced with my most important choices. To help explain why, I will give you a simple example.

Though most people think that they are striving to get the things (toys, bigger houses, money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, for most people those things don’t supply anywhere near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does.

The things are just the bait. Chasing after them forces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselves that matters to us and to those around us. This means that for most people success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning rapidly about oneself and one’s environment, and then changing to improve.

If you are disappointed because you can’t be the best person to do everything yourself, you are terribly naive. Nobody can do everything well. Would you want to have Einstein on your basketball team? When he fails to dribble and shoot well, would you think badly of him? Should he feel humiliated? Imagine all the areas in which Einstein was incompetent, and imagine how hard he struggled to excel even in the areas in which he was the best in the world. Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative. Most of life’s greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it’s up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.

The second—accepting your weaknesses while trying to turn them into strengths—is probably the best path if it works.

Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste.

Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste. Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things that you want or need even more. Some people fail at this point, before they’ve even started.

People who push through successfully have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make certain each item is ticked off in order.

Your deepest-seated needs and fears—such as the need to be loved and the fear of losing love, the need to survive and the fear of not surviving, the need to be important and the fear of not mattering—reside in primitive parts of your brain such as the amygdala, which are structures in your temporal lobe that process emotions.

They understand that you can’t make a great decision without swimming for a while in a state of “not knowing.”.

People typically try to prove that they have the answer even when they don’t. Why do they behave in this unproductive way? It’s generally because they believe the senseless but common view that great people have all the answers and don’t have any weaknesses. Not only does this view not square with reality, it stands in the way of their progress. People interested in making the best possible decisions are rarely confident that they have the best answers. They recognize that they have weaknesses and blind spots, and they always seek to learn more so that they can get around them.

To me, it’s pointless when people get angry with each other when they disagree because most disagreements aren’t threats as much as opportunities for learning.

Are you willing to fight to find out what’s true? Do you deeply believe that finding out what is true is essential to your well-being? Do you have a genuine need to find out if you or others are doing something wrong that is standing in the way of achieving your goals? If your answer to any of these questions is no, accept that you will never live up to your potential. If, on the other hand, you are up for the challenge of becoming radically open-minded, the first step in doing so is to look at yourself objectively. In the next chapter, Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently, you’ll have a chance to do just that.

Because of the different ways that our brains are wired, we all experience reality in different ways and any single way is essentially distorted. This is something that we need to acknowledge and deal with. So if you want to know what is true and what to do about it, you must understand your own brain.

Once I understood that it’s all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at people because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren’t intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterproductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked. I also realized that as off-base as they seemed to me, they saw me the same way. The only sensible way of behaving with each other was to look down upon ourselves with mutual understanding so we could make objective sense of things. Not only did this make our disagreements less frustrating, it also allowed us to maximize our effectiveness.

For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity—and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency. These two people might make a great team, but are likely to have trouble taking advantage of the ways they’re complementary, because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see the value of each other’s ways of thinking.

This led to one of my most valuable management tools: Baseball Cards, which I mentioned in the first part of this book. Just as a baseball card compiles the relevant data on a baseball player, helping fans know what that player is good and bad at, I decided that it would be similarly helpful for us to have cards for all of our players at Bridgewater.

I used a combination of adjectives we already used to describe people, like “conceptual,” “reliable,” “creative,” and “determined”; the actions people took or didn’t take such as “holding others accountable” and “pushing through to results”; and terms from personality tests such as “extroverted” or “judging.”.

In his book The Meaning of Human Existence, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Edward O. Wilson surmises that between one million and two million years ago, when our ancestors were somewhere between chimpanzees and modern homo sapiens, the brain evolved in ways supporting cooperation so man could hunt and do other activities. This led the centers of memory and reasoning in the prefrontal cortex to develop beyond those of our primate relatives. As groups became more powerful than individuals and our brains evolved in ways that made larger groups manageable, competition between groups became more important than competition between individuals and groups that had more cooperative individuals did better than those without them. This evolution led to the development of altruism, morality, and the sense of conscience and honor. Wilson explains that man is perpetually suspended between the two extreme forces that created us: “Individual selection [which] prompted sin and group selection [which] promoted virtue.”.

Which of these forces (self-interest or collective interest) wins out in any organization is a function of that organization’s culture, which is a function of the people who shape it. But it’s clear that collective interest is what’s best, not just for the organization but for the individuals who make it up. As I’ll explain in Work Principles, the rewards of working together to make the pie bigger are greater than the rewards of self-interest, not only in terms of how much “pie” one gets but also in the psychic rewards wired.

Then I read Charles Duhigg’s best-selling book The Power of Habit, which really opened my eyes. I recommend that you read it yourself if your interest in this subject goes deeper than what I’m able to cover here. Duhigg’s core idea is the role of the three-step “habit loop.” The first step is a cue—some “trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use,” according to Duhigg. Step two is the routine, “which can be physical or mental or emotional.” Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is “worth remembering for the future.” Repetition reinforces this loop.

And which to get rid of and then go about doing that. To help you, I recommend that you write down your three most harmful habits. Do that right now. Now pick one of those habits and be committed to breaking it. Can.

To help you, I recommend that you write down your three most harmful habits. Do that right now. Now pick one of those habits and be committed to breaking it. Can you do that? That would be extraordinarily impactful. If you break all three, you will radically improve the trajectory of your life. Or you can pick habits that you want to acquire and then acquire them.

I’ve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others’ weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles.

It doesn’t matter what you do with your life, as long as you are doing what is consistent with your nature and your aspirations.

There is no correlation between.

There is no correlation between happiness levels and conventional markers of success.

Having spent time with some of the richest, most powerful, most admired people in the world, as well as some of the poorest, most disadvantaged people in the most obscure corners of the globe, I can assure you that, beyond a basic level, there is no correlation between happiness levels and conventional markers of success.

Let’s say the reward for being right is $100 and its probability is 60 percent, while the penalty for being wrong is also $100. If you multiply the reward by the probability of being right you get $60 and if you multiply the penalty by the probability of being wrong (40 percent) you get $40. If you subtract the penalty from the reward, the difference is the expected value, which in this case is positive (+$20). Once you understand expected value, you also understand that it’s not always best to bet on what’s most probable. For example, suppose something that has only a one-in-five chance (20 percent) of succeeding will return ten times (e.g., $1,000) the amount that it will cost you if it fails ($100). Its expected value is positive ($120), so it’s probably a smart decision, even though the odds are against you, as long as you can also cover the loss.

All of your “must-dos” must be above the bar before you do your “like-to-dos.” Separate your “must-dos” from your “like-to-dos” and don’t mistakenly slip any “like-to-dos” onto the first list.

Your evolutionary process can be described as a 5-Step Process for getting what you want. It consists of setting goals, identifying and not tolerating problems, diagnosing problems, coming up with designs to get around them, and then doing the tasks required. The important thing to remember is that no one can do all the steps well, but that it’s possible to rely on others to help. Different people with different abilities working well together create the most powerful machines to produce achievements.

Work is either 1) a job you do to earn the money to pay for the life you want to have or 2) what you do to achieve your mission, or some mix of the two. I urge you to make it as much 2) as possible, recognizing the value of 1). If you do that, most everything will go better than if you don’t.

Learning is compounded and accelerated when everyone has the opportunity to hear what everyone else is thinking.

“There is no worse course in leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.”.

Aligning what you say with what you think and what you think with what you feel will make you much happier and much more successful.

I’ve learned that the people whose opinions matter most are those who know us best—our clients and our employees—and that our radical transparency serves us well with them.

To me, a meaningful relationship is one in which people care enough about each other to be there whenever someone needs support and they enjoy each other’s company so much that they can have great times together both inside and outside of work. I literally love many of the people I work with, and I respect them deeply.

Sometimes people mistake generosity for not being fair.

For example, most people will operate in a way that maximizes the amount of money they will get and that minimizes the amount of work they have to do to get it.

Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not to convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it. It must also be nonhierarchical, because in an idea meritocracy.

Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not to convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it. It must also be nonhierarchical, because in an idea meritocracy communication doesn’t just flow unquestioned from the top down. Criticisms must also come from the bottom up.

But it’s important to keep in mind what number of collaborators will play well together: A talented duo can improvise beautifully, as can a trio or quartet. But gather ten musicians and no matter how talented they are, it’s probably going to be too many unless they’re carefully orchestrated.

3 to 5 is more than 20. Three to five smart, conceptual people seeking the right answers in an open-minded way will generally lead to the best answers. It may be tempting to convene a larger group, but having too many people collaborate is counterproductive, even if the members of the larger group are smart and talented. The symbiotic advantages of adding people to a group grow incrementally (2+1=4.25) up to a point; beyond that, adding people actually subtracts from effectiveness. That is because 1) the marginal benefits diminish as the group gets larger (two or three people might be able to cover most of the important perspectives, so adding more people doesn’t bring much more) and 2) larger group interactions are less efficient than smaller ones. Of course, what’s best in practice depends on the quality of the people and the differences of the perspectives that they bring and how well the group is managed.

Remember that everyone has opinions and they are often bad. Opinions are easy to produce; everyone has plenty of them and most people are eager to share them—even to fight for them. Unfortunately many are worthless or even harmful, including a lot of your own.

Almost every group that agrees on the big things ends up fighting about less important things and becoming enemies even though they should be bound by the big things. This phenomenon is called the narcissism of small differences. Take the Protestants and Catholics. Though both are followers of Christ, some of them have been fighting for hundreds of years, even though many of them are unable to articulate the differences that divide them, and most of those who can articulate the differences realize that they are insignificant relative to the big important things that should bind them together. I once saw a close family have an irrevocable blow-out at a Thanksgiving dinner over who would cut the turkey. Don’t let this narcissism of small differences happen to you. Understand that nobody and nothing is perfect and that you are lucky to have by-and-large excellent relationships. See the big picture.

When people have both enough power to undermine a system and a desire to get what they want that is greater than their desire to maintain the system, the system will fail.

Great questions are a much better indicator of future success than great answers.

Remember that the only purpose of money is to get you what you want, so think hard about what you value and put it above money. How much would you sell a good relationship for? There’s not enough money in the world to get you to part with a valued relationship.

Every leader must decide between 1) getting rid of liked but incapable people to achieve their goals and 2) keeping the nice but incapable people and not achieving their goals. Whether or not you can make these hard decisions is the strongest determinant of your own success or failure.

If you ask everybody in an organization what percentage of the organization’s success they’re personally responsible for, you’ll wind up with a total of about 300 percent.

Compliments are easy to give but they don’t help people stretch. Pointing out someone’s mistakes and weaknesses (so they learn what they need to deal with) is harder and less appreciated, but much more valuable in the long run.

Understand that a great manager is essentially an organizational engineer. Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists. They are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them. They create process-flow diagrams to show how the machine works and to evaluate its design. They build metrics to light up how well each of the individual parts of the machine (most importantly, the people) and the machine as a whole are working. And they tinker constantly with its designs and its people to make both better.

Develop a full profile of each person’s values, abilities, and skills. These qualities are the real drivers of behavior, so knowing them in detail will tell you which jobs a person can and cannot do well, which ones they should avoid, and how the person should be trained. These profiles should change as the people change.

Use daily updates as a tool for staying on top of what your people are doing and thinking. I ask each person who reports to me to take about ten to fifteen minutes to write a brief description of what they did that day, the issues pertaining to them, and their reflections. By reading these updates and triangulating them (i.e., seeing other people’s takes on what they are doing together), I can gauge how they are working together, what their moods are, and which threads I should pull on.

One thing that leaders should not do, in my opinion, is be manipulative. Sometimes leaders will use emotions to motivate people to do things that they would not do after reflecting clearly.

The second most common mistake people make is to depersonalize the diagnosis. Not connecting problems to the people who failed and not examining what it is about them that caused the failure will not lead to improvements of the individuals or the machines.

The third biggest reason for failure is to not connect what one is learning in one diagnosis to what was learned in prior ones. It is important to determine whether the root cause of a particular problem (“Harry was careless”) is part of a larger pattern (“Harry is often careless”) or not (“It’s unlike Harry to be careless”).

Bad outcomes don’t just happen; they occur because specific people make, or fail to make, specific decisions.

Bad outcomes don’t just happen; they occur because specific people make, or fail to make, specific decisions. A good diagnosis always gets to the level of determining what it is about those people that led to the bad outcomes. This can be uncomfortable but if someone isn’t suited for a job, they need to be moved out of it so that the same mistakes won’t keep occurring. Of course, nobody is perfect; everyone makes mistakes. So it is important to look at people’s track records and their specific strengths and weaknesses in doing a diagnosis.

Good problem solver is 1) they are able to logically describe how to handle the problem and 2) they have successfully solved similar problems in the past.

Root causes are described in adjectives, not verbs, so keep asking “why” to get at them. Since most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not do them in a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people who have specific patterns of behavior. Of course, a normally reliable person can make the occasional error and if that’s the case, then it can be forgiven, but when a problem is attributable to a person, you have to ask why they made the mistake—and you have to be as accurate in diagnosing a fault in a person as you would be if he or she were a piece of equipment.

I. Keep in mind that managers usually fail or fall short of their goals for one (or more) of five reasons. 1. They are too distant. 2. They have problems perceiving bad quality. 3. They have lost sight of how bad things have become because they have gotten used to it. 4. They have such high pride in their work (or such large egos) that they can’t bear to admit they are unable to solve their own problems. 5. They fear adverse consequences from admitting failure.

Remember that if you have the same people doing the same things, you should expect the same results.

Build the organization around goals rather than tasks.

An organization is the opposite of a building: Its foundation is at the top, so make sure you hire managers before you hire their reports. Managers can help design the machine and choose the people who complement it. People overseeing departments need to be able to think strategically as well as run the day-to-day. If they don’t anticipate what’s coming up, they’ll run the day-to-day off a cliff.

Don’t assume that people are operating in your interest rather than their own. A higher percentage of the population than you might imagine will cheat if given the opportunity. When offered the choice of being fair with you or taking more for themselves, most people will take more for themselves. Even a tiny amount of cheating is intolerable, so your happiness and success will depend on your controls. I have repeatedly learned this lesson the hard way.

Recognize that it is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have a greater number of ordinary people who are less well equipped. Great people and great technology both enhance productivity. Put them together in a well-designed machine and they improve it exponentially.

Governance is the oversight system that removes the people and the processes if they aren’t working well.

By checks, I mean people who check on other people to make sure they’re performing well, and by balances, I mean balances of power.

By checks, I mean people who check on other people to make sure they’re performing well, and by balances, I mean balances of power. Even the most benevolent leaders are prone to becoming more autocratic, if for no other reason than because managing a lot of people and having limited time to do it requires them to make numerous difficult choices quickly, and they sometimes lose patience with arguments and issue commands instead.


# Programming Collective Intelligence (Toby Segaran)

This book focuses on the other end of the spectrum, covering algorithms like Google's PageRank, which take user data and perform calculations to create new information that can enhance the user experience.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with algorithms that allow computers to learn. What this means, in most cases, is that an algorithm is given a set of data and infers information about the properties of the data—and that information allows it to make predictions about other data that it might see in the future. This is possible because almost all nonrandom data contains patterns, and these patterns allow the machine to generalize. In order to generalize, it trains a model with what it determines are the important aspects of the data.

You know that the low-tech way to get recommendations for products, movies, or entertaining web sites is to ask your friends.

A collaborative filtering algorithm usually works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set with tastes similar to yours. It looks at other things they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions. There are several different ways of deciding which people are similar and combining their choices to make a list; this chapter will cover a few of these.

This formula calculates the distance, which will be smaller for people who are more similar. However, you need a function that gives higher values for people who are similar. This can be done by adding 1 to the function (so you don't get a division-by-zero error) and inverting it:.

# Sebastian and the troll | Fredrik Backman (fredrikbackman.com)

But Sebastian’s darkness is not just a light switch that someone forgot to flip, not just a pill he doesn’t want to take.

He can’t sleep at night. Sometimes his parents can’t either. He can see their tears run slowly down the outside of the glass then, they sound like rain over rooftops. Sebastian knows that his parents wish that something awful had happened to him. Because then there’d be a reason for him to hurt. Then he could be understood, maybe even fixed. But Sebastian’s darkness is not just a light switch that someone forgot to flip, not just a pill he doesn’t want to take.

”What are you writing on the notes?” Sebastian asks. ”Your name”, the troll answers. ”Why?” ”So that you don’t forget that you are somebody.” Sebastian doesn’t know what to reply to that. So he says: ”Nice pen.” ”It’s the most beautiful pen I know, I always carry it with me because I want them to know that I love them”, the troll says. ”Who?” ”The letters.” Sebastian’s fingertips touch the glass of the bubble. ”How did you get in here?” he asks. ”I didn’t get in, I got out”, the troll says and stretches sleepily. ”From what?” ”From you. Through one of the cracks.” ”I’ve cracked?”.

Sebastian’s fingers fumble over his stomach. His throat. His face. Small, tiny cracks everywhere. They don’t hurt. Sebastian thinks that maybe he’s forgotten how to do it, how to hurt in places where other people hurt, in all the normal ways. Burn-your-hand-on-a-hot-pan-ways. Stub-your-toe-on-furniture-ways. Now he only hurts in weird ways. Ways-that-don’-t leave-a-scar-ways. Ways-that-can’t-bee-seen-on-an-x-ray-ways.

”I can’t teach you how to make it stop hurting, Sebastian.” ”Then what can you teach me?” Sebastian breathes in reply. ”How to fight.” ”Fight against what?” ”Against everybody that’s coming tonight.” ”Who?” ”Your nightmares. Your weaknesses. Your inadequacies. Your monsters.” And at night, they come. All of them.

Every monster from under every bed and every creature from the darkest rooms inside his head.

”I mean that sometimes you think you’re sure of something, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t be wrong. You could for example see a balloon and be sure that someone dropped it, but it might actually have run away.”.

”What do we do now?” ”Sleep”, the troll suggests. ”Why?” the boy asks. ”Because sometimes when you wake up there’s breakfast.”.

”What’s up there?” he asks and points to the top of the cliffs where the rope is attached. ”A life. A hundred thousand years of all the best and all the worst”, the troll whispers. ”And in-between that?” The troll smiles, almost happily. ”Oh, yes! THAT! All the in-between. You get to choose that. The best and the worst in life just happens to us, but the in-between… that’s what keeps us going.” Sebastian’s breath bounces around in his throat. ”Will you come with me?” ”Yes. We’ll all come with you.” Sebastian’s face crumples up like confused laundry. ”Who’s ’we’?” ”We”, the troll repeats. When Sebastian looks out over the beach he sees a hundred thousand trolls. ”Who are they?” The troll hugs.

One day when someone says something and maybe he laughs for the first time. Or when he laughs as if it were the first time, over and over again. Laughs as if someone a very, very long time ago found the laugh on the ground in a forest, broken to pieces after a storm, and brought it home and nursed it until the laugh was strong enough to be released into the wild again. And then it takes off from the rooftops, straight up towards the heavens, as if someone let go of a balloon to make it happy. Maybe, in a hundred thousand years.


# Something about the anxiety | Fredrik Backman (fredrikbackman.com)

But sometimes you need to be in a really good place to feel able to talk about the other ones.

Someone writes about you on social media. Someone talks shit about you on the radio. You’re expected not to care about criticism, of course, as if sales figures would make you immune to feeling bad about yourself. As if that’s how self esteem ever works. You want to apologize to them when they say you’re overrated. You want them to know that you never fucking meant for any of this shit to get so big. You just wanted to write stories and make a living and go home. But it doesn’t work like that anymore. There are expectations and obligations now. You owe a lot of people a lot of things. They tell you to be grateful, and you are. You’re so grateful you can’t sleep at night, because you’re convinced now that for the Universe to be fair something really awful must be coming your way really soon.

# Educated (Tara Westover)

Home. All my father’s stories were about our mountain, our valley, our jagged little patch of Idaho. He never told me what to do if I left the mountain, if I crossed oceans and continents and found myself in strange terrain, where I could no longer search the horizon for the Princess. He never told me how I’d know when it was time to come home.

All my father’s stories were about our mountain, our valley, our jagged little patch of Idaho. He never told me what to do if I left the mountain, if I crossed oceans and continents and found myself in strange terrain, where I could no longer search the horizon for the Princess. He never told me how I’d know when it was time to come home.

Mother did her makeup every morning, but if she didn’t have time she’d apologize all day, as if by not doing it, she had inconvenienced everyone.

Had tried to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.

“Those doctors will just kill you quicker,” Dad said one evening when Grandma returned from a consultation. Grandma refused to quit chemotherapy, but she did ask Mother about herbal treatments. Mother had brought some with her, hoping Grandma would ask, and Grandma tried them—foot soaks in red clay, cups of bitter parsley tea, tinctures of horsetail and hydrangea.

Grandma was seeing a lot of doctors these days, because she had cancer in her bone marrow.

Dad could command this science, could decipher its language, decrypt its logic, could bend and twist and squeeze from it the truth. But as it passed through him, it turned to chaos.

Sitting across from me is my father, and as I look into his worn face it hits me, a truth so powerful I don’t know why I’ve never understood it before. The truth is this: that I am not a good daughter. I am a traitor, a wolf among sheep; there is something different about me and that difference is not good. I want to bellow, to weep into my father’s knees and promise never to do it again. But wolf that I am, I am still above lying, and anyway he would sniff the lie. We both know that if I ever again find Shawn on the highway, soaked in crimson, I will do exactly what I have just done. I am not sorry, merely ashamed.

Mother hugged me. Dad tried to be cheerful. “It proves one thing at least,” he said. “Our home school is as good as any public education.”.

“Why do you always take her side! A man should be able to expect support from his wife!”.

The lecture began when an old man with small eyes and a sharp nose shuttered the windows. He flipped a switch and a slide projector filled the room with white light. The image was of a painting. The professor discussed the composition, the brushstrokes, the history. Then he moved to the next painting, and the next and the next. Then the projector showed a peculiar image, of a man in a faded hat and overcoat. Behind him loomed a concrete wall. He held a small paper near his face but he wasn’t looking at it. He was looking at us. I opened the picture book I’d purchased for the class so I could take a closer look. Something was written under the image in italics but I couldn’t understand it. It had one of those black-hole words, right in the middle, devouring the rest. I’d seen other students ask questions, so I raised my hand. The professor called on me, and I read the sentence aloud. When I came to the word, I paused. “I don’t know this word,” I said. “What does it mean?” There was silence. Not a hush, not a muting of the noise, but utter, almost violent silence. No papers shuffled, no pencils scratched. The professor’s lips tightened. “Thanks for that,” he said, then returned to his notes. I scarcely moved for the rest of the lecture. I stared at my shoes, wondering what had happened, and why, whenever I looked up, there was always someone staring at me as if I was a freak. Of course I was a freak, and I knew it, but I didn’t understand how they knew it. When the bell rang, Vanessa.

There wasn’t a textbook for the class, just the picture book of paintings and a few CDs of classical compositions. I listened to the music while flipping through the paintings. I made a vague effort to remember who had painted or composed what, but I didn’t memorize spelling. The ACT was the only exam I’d ever taken, and it had been multiple choice, so I assumed all exams were multiple choice.

I called home. Dad answered. Mother was delivering a baby, which she was doing more and more now the migraines had stopped. “When will Mother be home?” I said. “Don’t know,” said Dad. “Might as well ask the Lord as me, as He’s the one deciding.” He chuckled, then asked, “How’s school?” Dad and I hadn’t spoken since he’d screamed at me about the VCR. I could tell he was trying to be supportive, but I didn’t think I could admit to him that I was failing. I wanted to tell him it was going well. So easy, I imagined myself saying. “Not great,” I said instead. “I had no idea it would be this hard.” The line was silent, and I imagined Dad’s stern face hardening. I waited for the jab I imagined he was preparing, but instead a quiet voice said, “It’ll be okay, honey.” “It won’t,” I said. “There will be no scholarship. I’m not even going to pass.” My voice was shaky now. “If there’s no scholarship, there’s no scholarship,” he said. “Maybe I can help with the money. We’ll figure it out. Just be happy, okay?” “Okay,” I said. “Come on home if you need.” I hung up, not sure what I’d just heard. I knew it wouldn’t last, that the next time we spoke everything would be different, the tenderness of this moment forgotten, the endless struggle between us again in the foreground. But tonight he wanted to help. And that was something.

Charles and I spent every evening together that week. We haunted public parks and ice cream shops, burger joints and gas stations. I took him to Stokes, because I loved it there, and because the assistant manager would always give me the unsold doughnuts from the bakery. We talked about music—about bands I’d never heard of and about how he wanted to be a musician and travel the world. We never talked about us—about whether we were friends or something else. I wished he would bring it up but he didn’t. I wished he would let me know some other way—by gently taking my hand or putting an arm around me—but he didn’t do that, either. On Friday we stayed out late, and when I.

Midterm. Sound good?” I said it did. It was a long shot, but I was the queen of long shots.

“You didn’t see what you thought you saw,” I said. If someone had asked me, I’d have said Charles was the most important thing in the world to me. But he wasn’t. And I would prove it to him. What was important to me wasn’t love or friendship, but my ability to lie convincingly to myself: to believe I was strong. I could never forgive Charles for knowing I wasn’t.

It’s comforting to think the defect is mine, because that means it is under my power.

It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you,.

I have so many bills I can’t imagine how I’m going to pay them. But God will provide either trials for growth or the means to succeed.

He’d seemed to say, “First find out what you are capable of, then decide who you are.”.

“You must stop yourself from thinking like that,” Dr. Kerry said, his voice raised. “You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were. It was always in you. Not in Cambridge. In you. You are gold. And returning to BYU, or even to that mountain you came from, will not change who you are. It may change how others see you, it may even change how you see yourself—even gold appears dull in some lighting—but that is the illusion. And it always was.”.

Me, and almost everyone at BYU, Mark was Mormon.

My family was splitting down the middle—the three who had left the mountain, and the four who had stayed. The three with doctorates, and the four without high school diplomas. A chasm had appeared, and was growing.


# The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition (Richard Dawkins)

We are survival machines — robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes.

I have long felt that biology ought to seem as exciting as a mystery story, for a mystery story is exactly what biology.

Blackheaded gulls nest in large colonies, the nests being only a few feet apart. When the chicks first hatch out they are small and defenceless and easy to swallow. It is quite common for a gull to wait until a neighbour's back is turned, perhaps while it is away fishing, and then pounce on one of the neighbour's chicks and swallow it whole. It thereby obtains a good nutritious meal, without having to go to the trouble of catching a fish, and without having to leave its own nest unprotected.

If you already know something about evolution, you may find something slightly paradoxical about the last point. Can we reconcile the idea that copying errors are an essential prerequisite for evolution to occur, with the statement that natural selection favours high copying-fidelity? The answer is that although evolution may seem, in some vague sense, a ‘good thing’, especially since we are the product  {18}  of it, nothing actually ‘wants’ to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it happening. Jacques Monod made this point very well in his Herbert Spencer lecture, after wryly remarking: ‘Another curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands it!’.

Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in the dictionary of a word like ‘living’ does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world.

One gene maybe regarded as a unit that survives through a large number of successive individual bodies. This is the central argument that will be developed in this chapter. It is an argument that some of my most respected colleagues obstinately refuse to agree with, so you must forgive me if I seem to labour it! First I must briefly explain the facts of sex.

Gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.

A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.

Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.

For example, a number of attributes are desirable in an efficient carnivore's body, among them sharp cutting teeth, the right kind of intestine for digesting meat, and many other things. An efficient herbivore, on the other hand, needs flat grinding teeth, and a much longer intestine with a different kind of digestive chemistry. In a herbivore gene pool, any new gene that conferred on its possessors sharp meat-eating teeth would not be very successful. This is not because meat-eating is universally a bad idea, but because you cannot efficiently eat meat unless you also have the right sort of intestine, and all the other attributes of a meat-eating way of life. Genes for sharp, meat-eating teeth are not inherently bad genes. They are only bad genes in a gene-pool that is dominated by genes for herbivorous qualities.

For instance, a gene that made old bodies develop cancer could be passed on to numerous offspring because the individuals would reproduce before they got cancer. On the other hand, a gene that made young adult bodies develop cancer would not be passed on to very many offspring, and a gene that made young children develop fatal cancer would not be passed on to any offspring at all. According to this theory then, senile decay is simply a by-product of the accumulation in the gene pool of late-acting lethal and semi-lethal genes, which have been allowed to slip through the net of natural selection simply because they are late-acting.

We no longer have to resort to superstition when faced with the deep problems: Is there a meaning to life? What are we for? What is man? After posing the last of these questions, the eminent zoologist G. G. Simpson put it thus: ‘The point I want to make now is that all attempts to answer that question before 1859 are worthless and that we will be better off if we ignore them completely.’(1).

Revolution have yet to be widely realized. Zoology.

My purpose is to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism.

They made the erroneous assumption that the important thing in evolution is the good of the species (or the group) rather than the good of the individual (or the gene).

If we were told that a man had lived a long and prosperous life in the world of Chicago gangsters, we would be entitled to make some guesses as to the sort of man he was. We might expect that he would have qualities such as toughness, a quick trigger finger, and the ability to attract loyal friends. These would not be infallible deductions, but you can make some inferences about a man's character if you know something about the conditions in which he has survived and prospered. The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes.

Selfish, but we are not necessarily.

More well known is the macabre cannibalism of female praying mantises. Mantises are large carnivorous insects. They normally eat smaller insects such as flies, but they will attack almost anything that moves. When they mate, the male cautiously creeps up on the female, mounts her, and copulates. If the female gets the chance, she will eat him, beginning by biting his head off, either as the male is approaching, or immediately after he mounts, or after they separate. It might seem most sensible for her to wait until copulation is over before she starts to eat him. But the loss of the head does not seem to throw the rest of the male's body off its sexual stride. Indeed, since the insect head is the seat of some inhibitory nerve centres, it is possible that the female improves the male's sexual performance by eating his head.(3) If so, this is an added benefit. The primary one is that she obtains a good meal.

That living creatures evolve to do things ‘for the good of the species’ or ‘for the good of the group’. It is easy to see how this idea got its start in biology. Much of an animal's life is devoted to reproduction, and most of the acts of altruistic self-sacrifice that are observed in nature are performed by parents towards their young. ‘Perpetuation of the species’ is a common euphemism for reproduction, and it is undeniably a consequence of reproduction. It requires only a slight over-stretching of logic to deduce that the ‘function’ of reproduction is ‘to’ perpetuate the species.

A gene that is ignored in this way is called recessive.

A gene that is ignored in this way is called recessive. The opposite of a recessive gene is a dominant gene.

For instance it follows from it that if we wanted to increase the human life span, there are two general ways in which we could do it. Firstly, we could ban reproduction before a certain age, say forty. After some centuries of this the minimum age limit would be raised to fifty, and so on. It is conceivable that human longevity could be pushed up to several centuries by this means. I cannot imagine that anyone would seriously want to institute such a policy.

If simulation is such a good idea, we might expect that survival machines would have discovered it first. After all, they invented many of the other techniques of human engineering long before we came on the scene: the focusing lens and the parabolic reflector, frequency analysis of sound waves, servo-control, sonar, buffer  {59}  storage of incoming information, and countless others with long names, whose details don't matter. What about simulation? Well, when you yourself have a difficult decision to make involving unknown quantities in the future, you do go in for a form of simulation. You imagine what would happen if you did each of the alternatives open to you. You set up a model in your head, not of everything in the world, but of the restricted set of entities which you think may be relevant. You may see them vividly in your mind's eye, or you may see and manipulate stylized abstractions of them. In either case it is unlikely that somewhere kid out in your brain is an actual spatial model of the events you are imagining. But, just as in the computer, the details of how your brain represents its model of the world are less important than the fact that it is able to use it to predict possible events’. Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error. The trouble with overt trial is that it takes time and energy. The trouble with overt error is that it is often fatal. Simulation is both safer and faster.

Natural selection favours genes that control their survival machines in such a way that they make the best use of their environment.

‘Attack opponent; if he flees pursue him; if he retaliates run away.’.

Genetically speaking, your first cousin is equivalent to a great-grandchild.

Kin selection is emphatically not a special case of group selection.(4) It is a special consequence of gene selection.

This is not so difficult to imagine as it appears. When a man throws a ball high in the air and catches it again, he behaves as if he had solved a set of differential equations in predicting the trajectory of the ball. He may neither know nor care what a differential equation is, but this does not affect his skill with the ball. At some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to the mathematical calculations is going on.

Net benefit of behaviour pattern = Benefit to self – Risk to self  {97}  + 1/2 Benefit to brother – 1/2 Risk to brother + 1/2 Benefit to other brother – 1/2 Risk to other brother + 1/8 Benefit to first cousin – 1/8 Risk to first cousin + 1/2 Benefit to child – 1/2 Risk to child + etc. The result of the sum will be a number called the net benefit score of that behaviour pattern. Next, the model animal computes the equivalent sum for each alternative behaviour pattern in his repertoire. Finally he chooses to perform the behaviour pattern which emerges with the largest net benefit. Even if all the scores come out negative, he should still choose the action with the highest one, the least of evils. Remember that any positive action involves consumption of energy and time, both of which could have been spent doing other things. If doing nothing emerges as the ‘behaviour’ with the highest net benefit score, the model animal will do nothing.

If C is my identical twin, then I should care for him twice as much as I care for any of my children, indeed I should value his life no less than my own.(11) But can I be sure of him? He looks like me to be sure, but it could be that we just happen to share the genes for facial features. No, I will not give up my life for him, because although it is possible that he bears 100 per cent of my genes, I absolutely know that  {106}  I contain 100 per cent of my genes, so I am worth more to me than he is. I am the only individual that any one of my selfish genes can be sure of. And although ideally a gene for individual selfishness could be displaced by a rival gene for altruistically saving at least one identical twin, two children or brothers, or at least four grand-children etc., the.

In many species a mother can be more sure of her young than a father can. The mother lays the visible, tangible egg, or bears the child. She has a good chance of knowing for certain the bearers of her own genes. The poor father is much more vulnerable to deception. It is therefore to be expected that fathers will put less effort than mothers into caring for young.

Similarly, maternal grandmothers can be more sure of their grandchildren than paternal grandmothers can, and might be expected to show more altruism than paternal grand-mothers. This is because they can be sure of their daughter's children,.

Similarly, maternal grandmothers can be more sure of their grandchildren than paternal grandmothers can, and might be expected to show more altruism than paternal grand-mothers. This is because they can be sure of their daughter's children, but their son may have been cuckolded.

Similarly, maternal grandmothers can be more sure of their grandchildren than paternal grandmothers can, and might be expected to show more altruism than paternal grand-mothers. This is because they can be sure of their daughter's children, but their son may have been cuckolded. Maternal grandfathers are just as sure of their grandchildren as paternal grandmothers are, since both can reckon on one generation of certainty and one generation of uncertainty. Similarly, uncles on the mother's side should be more interested in the welfare of nephews and nieces than uncles on the father's side, and in general should be just as altruistic as aunts are. Indeed in a society with a high degree of marital infidelity, maternal uncles should be more altruistic than ‘fathers’ since they have more grounds for confidence in their relatedness to the child. They know that the child's mother is at least their half-sister. The ‘legal’ father knows nothing. I do not know of any evidence bearing on these predictions, but I offer them in the hope that others may, or may start looking for evidence. In particular, perhaps social anthropologists might have interesting things to say.(12).

Our conclusion from this chapter is that individual parents practise family planning, but in the sense that they optimize their birth-rates rather than restrict them for public good. They try to maximize the number of surviving children that they have, and this means having neither too many babies nor too few. Genes that make an individual have too many babies tend not to persist in the gene pool, because children containing such genes tend not to survive to adulthood.

Will it always pay a mother to treat all her children equally, or might she have favourites? Should the family function as a single cooperating whole, or are we to expect selfishness and deception even within the family? Will all members of a family be working towards the same optimum, or will they ‘disagree’ about what the optimum is? These are the questions we try to answer in the next chapter.

The sight of her child smiling, or the sound of her kitten purring, is rewarding to a mother, in the same sense as food in the stomach is rewarding to a rat in a maze.

If there is a human moral to be drawn, it is that we must teach our children altruism, for we cannot expect it to be part of their biological nature.

There is no reason why a man should not inherit a tendency to develop a long penis from his mother.

The female looks the males over, and tries to spot signs of fidelity and domesticity in advance. There is bound to be variation in the population of males in their predisposition to be faithful husbands. If females could recognize such qualities in advance, they could benefit themselves by choosing males possessing them. One way for a female to do this is to play hard to get for a long time, to be coy. Any male who is not patient enough to wait until the female eventually consents to copulate is not likely to be a good bet as a faithful husband.

‘I have already invested so much in the Concorde airliner (for instance) that I cannot afford to scrap it now.’ He should always ask instead whether it would pay him in the future, to cut his losses, and abandon the project now, even though he has already invested heavily in it.

The behavioural rules of the four types are as follows. Coy females will not copulate with a male until he has gone through a long and expensive courtship period lasting several weeks. Fast females will copulate immediately with anybody. Faithful males are prepared to go on courting for a long time, and after copulation they stay with the female and help her to rear the young. Philanderer males lose patience quickly if a female will not copulate with them straight away: they go off and look for another female; after copulation too they do not stay and act as good fathers, but go off in search of fresh females.

If you do the sums, it turns out that a population in which 5/6 of the females are coy, and 5/8 of the males are faithful, is evolutionarily stable.

‘Some of our best generals have only one eye!’.

A pack of hyenas can catch prey so much larger than a lone hyena can bring down that it pays each selfish individual to hunt in a pack, even though this involves sharing food. It is probably for similar reasons that some spiders cooperate in building a huge communal web. Emperor penguins conserve heat by huddling together. Each one gains by presenting a smaller surface area to the elements than he would on his own. A fish who swims obliquely behind another fish may gain a  {167}  hydrodynamic advantage from the turbulence produced by the fish in front.

A related trick concerned with air turbulence is known to racing cyclists, and it may account for the V-formation of flying birds. There is probably competition to avoid the disadvantageous position at the head of the flock. Possibly the birds take turns as unwilling leader — a form of the delayed reciprocal-altruism to be discussed at the end of the chapter.

This sounds like a contradiction, but it is not. A male gets all his genes from his mother, but a mother only gives half her genes to her son.

This is  {192}  the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.(1).

But if you contribute to the world's culture, if you have a good idea, compose a tune, invent a sparking plug, write a poem, it may live on, intact, long after your genes have dissolved in the common pool. Socrates may or may not have a gene or two alive in the world today, as G. C. Williams has remarked, but who cares? The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leonardo, Copernicus and Marconi are still going strong.

Convicted of the crime, but receive some credit for giving evidence and get a.

A question that sociologists and psychologists sometimes ask is why blood donors (in countries, such as Britain, where they are not paid) give blood. I find it hard to believe that the answer lies in reciprocity or disguised selfishness in any simple sense. It is not as though regular blood donors receive preferential treatment when they come to need a transfusion. They are not even issued with little gold stars to wear. Maybe I am naive, but I find myself tempted to see it as a genuine case of pure, disinterested altruism. Be that as it may,  {231}  blood-sharing in vampire bats seems to fit the Axelrod model well. We learn this from the work of G. S. Wilkinson.

I suggest that the most important question to ask about any parasite is this. Are its genes transmitted to future generations via the same vehicles as the host's genes? If they are not, I would expect it to damage the host, in one way or another. But if they are, the parasite will do all that it can to help the host, not only to survive but to reproduce. Over evolutionary time it will cease to be a parasite, will cooperate with the host, and may eventually merge into the host's tissues and become unrecognizable as a parasite at all.

Natural selection favours those genes that manipulate the world to ensure their own propagation.

An animal's behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes ‘for’ that behaviour, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.

To begin with, what do I mean by bottlenecked? No matter how many cells there may be in the body of an elephant, the elephant began life as a single cell, a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg is a narrow bottleneck which, during embryonic development, widens out into the trillions of cells of an adult elephant. And no matter how many cells, of no matter how many specialized types, cooperate to perform the unimaginably complicated task of running an adult elephant, the efforts of all those cells converge on the final goal of producing single cells again — sperms or eggs. The elephant not only has its beginning in a single cell, a fertilized egg. Its end, meaning its goal or end-product, is the production of single cells, fertilized eggs of the next generation. The life cycle of the broad and bulky elephant both begins and ends with a narrow bottleneck. This bottlenecking is characteristic of the life cycles of all many-celled animals and most plants. Why? What is its significance? We cannot answer this without considering what life might look like without it.


# The Deal Of  A Lifetime (Backman, Fredrik)

Most of us so desperately want to believe that every heart which stops beating is missed equally.

When five-year-old girls die, no one writes about that, there aren’t any memorials in the evening papers, their feet are still too small, they haven’t had time to make anyone care about their footsteps yet.

It’s so easy to kill someone, all a person like me needs is a car and a few seconds. Because people like you trust me, you drive thousands of kilos of metal at hundreds of kilometres an hour, hurtling through the darkness with the people you love most sleeping in the backseat, and when someone like me approaches from the opposite direction, you trust that I don’t have bad brakes. That I’m not looking for my phone between the seats, not driving too fast, not drifting between lanes because I’m blinking the tears from my eyes. That I’m not sitting on the slip road to the 111 with my headlights out, just waiting for a lorry. You trust me. That I’m not drunk. That I’m not going to kill you.

I’m an egotist, you learnt that early on. Your mother once screamed that I’m the kind of person who doesn’t have any equals, I only have people above me that I want something from and people beneath me who I trample on.

When the doctor gave me the diagnosis, I didn’t have an awakening, I just did my accounts. Everything I’d built, the footprints I’ve left behind. Weak people always look at people like me and say, ‘He’s rich, but is he happy?’ As though that was a relevant measure of anything. Happiness is for children and animals, it doesn’t have any biological function. Happy people don’t create anything, their world is one without art and music and skyscrapers, without discoveries and innovations. All leaders, all of your heroes, they’ve been obsessed. Happy people don’t get obsessed, they don’t devote their lives to curing illnesses or making planes take off. The happy leave nothing behind. They live for the sake of living, they’re only on earth as consumers. Not me.


# 12 Ways to Select the Best Product Idea to Bring to Market (predictabledesigns.com)

You ideally want the suggested retail price for your product to be about 4x what it costs to manufacture.

You can push that down to 3x the manufacturing cost, especially if you’re selling direct to consumers and not going through distributors or retail chains.

Bringing a completely unique product to market can be really challenging. Not only do you have to convince people that this problem even exists and that they need it solved, but you also have to convince them that your product is the best solution to the problem.

It will always be easier to sell your product to 10% of the people in a group of 100,000, than to 1% of a group of 1,000,000 people.

You are better off focusing on a niche product, or at least somewhat of a niche product, that has a market that you can reach. This is the reason for the expression “the riches are in the niches”.

My idea was to sell upside down globes and maps (and t-shirts and such with upside down maps) in countries located south of the equator.

It’s almost never that easy. It may be easy to quickly prove an idea is bad, but not so easy to prove that it is a good idea.

There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when you’re sixteen, and that’s having a kid who bites it from cancer.

# The Rosie Project: A Novel (Simsion, Graeme)

Restaurants are minefields for the socially inept, and I was nervous as always in these situations.

In fact, her breasts were probably no more than one and a half standard deviations from the mean size for her body weight and hardly a remarkable identifying feature.

Julie seemed unimpressed, and in reviewing the interaction later, I realized that Gene must have lied to her about his reason for not being present. This was presumably to protect Julie from feeling that her lecture was unimportant to Gene and to provide a justification for a less prestigious speaker being sent as a substitute. It seems hardly possible to analyze such a complex situation involving deceit and supposition of another person’s emotional response, and then prepare your own plausible lie, all while someone is waiting for you to reply to a question. Yet that is exactly what people expect you to be able to do.

“Rational detachment: is that a euphemism for lack of emotion?”.

“Imagine,” I said, “you’re hiding in a basement. The enemy is searching for you and your friends. Everyone has to keep totally quiet, but your baby is crying.” I did an impression, as Gene would, to make the story more convincing: “Waaaaa.” I paused dramatically. “You have a gun.” Hands went up everywhere. Julie jumped to her feet as I continued. “With a silencer. They’re coming closer. They’re going to kill you all. What do you do? The baby’s screaming—” The kids couldn’t wait.

The second friend was Daphne, whose friendship period also overlapped with Gene and Claudia’s. She moved into the apartment above mine after her husband entered a nursing home as a result of dementia. Due to knee failure, exacerbated by obesity, she was unable to walk more than a few steps, but she was highly intelligent and I began to visit her regularly. She had no formal qualifications, having performed a traditional female homemaker role. I considered this to be an extreme waste of talent—particularly as her descendants did not return the care. She was curious about my work, and we initiated the Teach Daphne Genetics Project, which was fascinating for both of us. She began eating her dinner in my apartment on a regular basis, as there are massive economies of scale in cooking one meal for two people rather than two separate meals. Each Sunday at 3:00 p.m. we would visit her husband at the nursing home, which was 7.3 kilometers away. I was able to combine a 14.6-kilometer walk pushing a wheelchair with interesting conversation about genetics. I would read while she spoke to her husband, whose level of comprehension was difficult to determine but definitely low. Daphne had been named after the plant that was flowering at the time of her birth, on the twenty-eighth of August. On each birthday, her husband would give her daphne flowers, and she considered this a highly romantic action. She complained that her approaching birthday would be the first occasion in fifty-six years on which this symbolic act would not be performed. The solution was obvious, and when I wheeled her to my apartment for dinner on her seventy-eighth birthday, I had purchased a quantity of the flowers to give her. She recognized the smell immediately and began crying. I thought I had made a terrible error, but she explained that her tears were a symptom of happiness. She was also impressed by the chocolate cake that I had made, but not to the same extent. During the meal, she made an incredible statement: “Don, you would make someone a wonderful husband.” This was so contrary to my experiences of being rejected by women that I was temporarily stunned. Then I presented her with the facts—the history of my attempts to find a partner, beginning with my assumption as a child that I would grow up and get married, and finishing with my abandonment of the idea as the evidence grew that I was unsuitable. Her argument was simple: there’s someone for everyone. Statistically, she was almost certainly correct. Unfortunately, the probability that I would find such a person was vanishingly small. But it created a disturbance in my brain, like a mathematical problem that we know must have a solution. For her next two birthdays, we repeated the flower ritual. The results were not as dramatic as the first time, but I also purchased gifts for her—books on genetics—and she seemed very happy. She told me that her birthday had always been her favorite day of the year. I understood that this view was common in children, owing to the gifts, but had not expected it in an adult. Ninety-three days after the third birthday dinner, we were traveling to the nursing home, discussing a genetics paper that Daphne had read the previous day, when it became apparent that she had forgotten some significant points. It was not the first time in recent weeks that her memory had been faulty, and I immediately organized an assessment of her cognitive functioning. The diagnosis was Alzheimer’s disease. Daphne’s intellectual capability deteriorated rapidly, and we were soon unable to have our discussions about genetics. But we continued our meals and walks to the nursing home. Daphne now spoke primarily about her past, focusing on her husband and family, and I was able to form a generalized view of what married life could be like. She continued to insist that I could find a compatible partner and enjoy the high level of happiness that she had experienced in her own life. Supplementary research confirmed that Daphne’s arguments were supported by evidence: married men are happier and live longer. One day Daphne asked, “When will it be my birthday again?” and I realized that she had lost track of dates. I decided that it would be acceptable to lie in order to maximize her happiness. The problem was to source some daphne out of season, but I had unexpected success. I was aware of a geneticist who was working on altering and extending the flowering of plants for commercial reasons. He was able to supply my flower vendor with some daphne, and we had a simulated birthday dinner. I repeated the procedure each time Daphne asked about her birthday. Eventually, it was necessary for Daphne to join her husband at the nursing home, and as her memory failed, we celebrated her birthdays more often, until I was visiting her daily. The flower vendor gave me a special loyalty card. I calculated that Daphne had reached the age of 207, according to the number of birthdays, when she stopped recognizing me, and 319 when she no longer responded to the daphne and I abandoned the visits.

Most male animals are programmed to give higher priority to sex than to assisting an unrelated individual, and Gene had the additional motivation of his research project. Arguing would be hopeless.

The underlying problem was the preoccupation with image.

Many women had included photos, but I had suppressed them in the database display to allow space for more important data.

I pointed out that I was collecting data to support life’s most critical decision.

“How about we do dinner tonight?” I repeated. “See, that wasn’t so hard. Make only positive comments about their appearance. Pay for the meal. Do not mention sex.” Gene walked to the door, then turned back. “What about the paper ones?” I gave him my questionnaires from Table for Eight, the singles party, and, at his insistence, even the partially completed ones from the speed dating. Now it was out of my hands.

I have heard the word stunning used to describe women, but this was the first time I had actually been stunned by one.

“No assistance is required,” I said. “I recommend reading a book.” I watched Rosie walk to the bookshelf, briefly peruse the contents, then walk away. Perhaps she used IBM rather than Apple software, although many of the manuals applied to both.

The sound system has an iPod port that I use to play podcasts while I cook. Rosie plugged in her phone, and music emanated from the speakers. It was not loud, but I was certain that if I had put on a podcast without asking permission when visiting someone’s house, I would have been accused of a social error.

Very certain, as I had made this exact mistake at a dinner party four years and sixty-seven days ago.

Vegetarians and vegans can be incredibly annoying. Gene has a joke: “How can you tell if someone is a vegan? Just wait ten minutes and they’ll tell you.” If this were so, it would not be so much of a problem. No! Vegetarians arrive for dinner and then say, “I don’t eat meat.” This was the second time. The Pig’s Trotter Disaster had happened six years ago, when Gene suggested that I invite a woman to dinner at my apartment. He argued that my cooking expertise would make me more desirable and I would not have to deal with the pressure of a restaurant environment. “And you can drink as much as you like and stagger to the bedroom.”.

“So, you cook this same meal every Tuesday, right?” “Correct.” I listed the eight major advantages of the Standardized Meal System. 1. No need to accumulate recipe books. 2. Standard shopping list—hence very efficient shopping. 3. Almost zero waste—nothing in the refrigerator or pantry unless required for one of the recipes. 4. Diet planned and nutritionally balanced in advance. 5. No time wasted wondering what to cook. 6. No mistakes, no unpleasant surprises. 7. Excellent food, superior to most restaurants at a much lower price (see point 3). 8. Minimal cognitive load required. “Cognitive load?” “The cooking procedures are in my cerebellum—virtually no conscious effort is required.” “Like riding a bike.” “Correct.” “You can make lobster whatever without thinking?” “Lobster, mango, and avocado salad with wasabi-coated flying fish roe and crispy seaweed and deep-fried leek garnish. Correct. My current project is quail boning. It still requires conscious effort.”.

Rosie interrupted again. “If you were on your usual schedule, what time would it be now?” “Six thirty-eight p.m.” The clock on the oven showed 9:09 p.m. Rosie located the controls and started adjusting the time. I realized what she was doing. A perfect solution. When she was finished, it showed 6:38 p.m. No recalculations required. I congratulated her on her thinking. “You’ve created a new time zone. Dinner will be ready at eight fifty-five p.m.—Rosie time.”.

I had another unexpected moment of feeling good as I continued recalculating times. Rosie interrupted again. “If you were on your usual schedule, what time would it be now?” “Six thirty-eight p.m.” The clock on the oven showed 9:09 p.m. Rosie located the controls and started adjusting the time. I realized what she was doing. A perfect solution. When she was finished, it showed 6:38 p.m. No recalculations required. I congratulated her on her thinking. “You’ve created a new time zone.

Her observation gave me an opportunity for another Wife Project question. “Do you find mathematics difficult?”.

Her observation gave me an opportunity for another Wife Project question. “Do you find mathematics difficult?” She laughed. “It’s only the single hardest part of what I do. Drives me nuts.” If the simple arithmetic of bar and restaurant bills was beyond her, it was hard to imagine how we could have meaningful discussions. “Where do you hide the corkscrew?” she asked. “Wine is not scheduled for Tuesdays.” “Fuck that,” said Rosie. There was a certain logic underlying Rosie’s response. I would only be eating a single serving of dinner. It was the final step in the abandonment of the evening’s schedule. I announced the change. “Time has been redefined. Previous rules no longer apply. Alcohol is hereby declared mandatory in the Rosie Time Zone.”.

Females seek maximum-quality genes for their children plus a male to support them.”.

An obvious thought occurred to me, obvious because I am a geneticist. “Your hair is a very unusual color. Possibly—” She laughed. “There aren’t any genes for this shade of red.” She must have seen that I was confused. “This color only comes out of a bottle.” I realized what she was saying. She had deliberately dyed her hair an unnaturally bright color. Incredible. It hadn’t even occurred to me to include hair dyeing on the questionnaire. I made a mental note to do so.

“Well,” she said, “it’s been an evening. Have a good life.”.

“People with long earlobes are more likely to choose partners with long earlobes. It’s a better predictor than IQ.”.

If she knew how many friends I had, she might have realized what a great compliment she had paid me.

Why do we focus on certain things at the expense of others? We will risk our lives to save a person from drowning, yet not make a donation that could save dozens of children from starvation.

Why do we focus on certain things at the expense of others? We will risk our lives to save a person from drowning, yet not make a donation that could save dozens of children from starvation. We install solar panels when their impact on CO2 emissions is minimal—and indeed may have a net negative effect if manufacturing and installation are taken into account—rather than contributing to more efficient infrastructure projects. I consider my own decision making in these areas to be more rational than that of most people, but I also make errors of the same kind. We are genetically programmed to react to stimuli in our immediate vicinity. Responding to complex issues that we cannot perceive directly requires the application of reasoning, which is less powerful than instinct.

This seemed to be the most likely explanation for my continued interest in the Father Project. Rationally, there were more important uses for my research capabilities, but instinctively I was driven to assist Rosie with her more immediate problem.

As I finished lunch.

It was interesting that Rosie also found conversation with a parent difficult. My mother is a good person but very focused on sharing personal information. Rosie picked up a slice of pizza and looked at the computer screen.

“I have never heard of the Wife Project. But I’m about to. In detail.” “Of course,” I said. “But we should time-share it with pizza consumption and beer drinking.”.

“How nice for them. Here’s a thought for you. Any woman who takes that test is willing to be treated as an object. You can say that’s their choice. But if you spent two minutes looking at how much society forces women to think of themselves as objects, you might not think so. What I want to know is, do you want a woman who thinks like that? Is that the sort of wife you want?” Rosie was sounding angry. “You know why I dress the way I do? Why these glasses? Because I don’t want to be treated as an object. If you knew how insulted I am that you think I was an applicant, a candidate—”.

Interested.” “Since when do women discuss anything explicitly?”.

“Since when do women discuss anything explicitly?” said Gene.

“Rosie and I discussed the question of a relationship explicitly. Neither of us is interested.” “Since when do women discuss anything explicitly?” said Gene.

If she doesn’t want you for yourself, then she’s not the right person for you.”.

“What about Daphne?” asked Claudia. It was true: Daphne was unlike the women I had dated. This was excellent therapy—refutation by counterexample. Perhaps Bianca would be a younger, dancing version of Daphne.

It is virtually impossible to make useful comparisons of levels of happiness, especially across long periods of time. But if I had been asked to choose the happiest day of my life, I would previously have nominated, without hesitation, the first day I spent at the American Museum of Natural History in New York when I traveled there for a conference during my PhD studies. The second-best day was the second day there, and the third-best the third day there. But after recent events, the answer was not so clear. It was difficult to choose between the Natural History Museum and the night of cocktail making at the golf club. Should I therefore consider resigning my job and accepting Amghad’s offer of a partnership in a cocktail bar? Would I be permanently happier? The idea seemed ludicrous. The cause of.

She died two years ago because of medical incompetence.”.

I know you don’t need my money, and my children do, but I have left you a small sum. I would be pleased if you would use it for something irrational.

On the way to the airport, I had asked Claudia for advice on dealing with so much time in the company of one person. “Remember to listen,” said Claudia. “If she asks you an awkward question, ask her why she’s asking. Turn it back to her. If she’s a psychology student, she’ll love talking about herself. Take notice of your emotions as well as logic. Emotions have their own logic. And try to go with the flow.”.

Gene frequently states that psychologists are incompetent at understanding themselves.

“It would be unreasonable to give you credit for being incredibly beautiful.”.

Amazing. She retains a professor of genetics, an alien of extraordinary abilities, to help find her father, she travels for a week, spending almost every minute of the waking day with him, yet when she wants the answer to a question on genetics, she goes to the Internet.

Claudia also suggested I watch As Good as It Gets, “just for fun.” Although her advice was to use it as an example of what not to do, I was impressed that the Jack Nicholson character handled a jacket problem with more finesse than I had. It was also encouraging that, despite serious social incompetence, a significant difference in age between him and the Helen Hunt character, probable multiple psychiatric disorders, and a level of intolerance far more severe than mine, he succeeded in winning the love of the woman in the end. An excellent choice by Claudia.

“If you really love someone,” Claudia continued, “you have to be prepared to accept them as they are. Maybe you hope that one day they get a wake-up call and make the changes for their own reasons.”.

I wished I had not learned to read expressions, because I could read Rosie’s now and I knew the answer.


# How to Do Your Research Project (Thomas, Gary)

People tell him he looks far too young to be a grandparent, but, believe it or not, he is the proud grandfather of a little boy called Nicholas. He likes, in alphabetical order, cats, chess, cycling, dogs and writing. He dislikes 4x4 cars, pomposity and people who try to make things sound more complicated than they are (in that order).

Despite supporting Aston Villa football club, he maintains an optimistic outlook on life.


# The Craft of Research, Fourth Edition (Booth, Wayne C.;Colomb, Gregory G.;Williams, Joseph M.;Bizup, Joseph;FitzGerald, William T.)

How we write thus affects how we argue and research, and vice versa.

You’ll discover both how new knowledge depends on what questions you ask and how the way you think about and communicate your research shapes those questions and your answers.

If you are beginning your first project, the task may seem overwhelming: How do I focus on a topic? Where do I find information on it? What do I do when I find it? Even if you’ve done a “research paper” in a writing class, the idea of another may be even more intimidating if this time it’s the real thing. If so, you’re not alone. Even experienced researchers feel anxious when they tackle a new kind of project for a new audience. So whatever anxiety you feel, most researchers have felt it too. The difference is that experienced researchers know what lies ahead—hard work, but also pleasure; some frustration, but more satisfaction; periods of confusion, but confidence that, in the end, it will all come together and that the result is worth the effort.

In fact, they create two kinds of plans: the first helps them prepare and conduct their research; the second helps them draft their paper.

They usually begin with a question and a plan to guide their search for an answer. They may not know exactly what they’ll find, but they know generally what it will look like, even if it surprises them. They also know that once they have an answer, they don’t just start writing, any more than an experienced carpenter just starts sawing. They draw up a second plan, a rough blueprint for a first draft—maybe no more than a sketch of an outline.

Teachers at all levels devote their lives to research. Governments spend billions on it, businesses even more. Research goes on in laboratories and libraries, in jungles and ocean depths, in caves and in outer space, in offices and, in the information age, even in our own homes. Research is in fact the world’s biggest industry. Those who cannot do it well or evaluate that of others will find themselves sidelined in a world increasingly dependent on sound ideas based on good information produced by trustworthy inquiry and then presented clearly and accurately.

Without trustworthy published research, we all would be locked in the opinions of the moment, prisoners of what we alone experience or dupes to whatever we’re told. Of course, we want to believe that our opinions are sound. Yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence.

Without trustworthy published research, we all would be locked in the opinions of the moment, prisoners of what we alone experience or dupes to whatever we’re told. Of course, we want to believe that our opinions are sound. Yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence. And as recent events have shown, those who act on unreliable evidence can lead us—indeed have led us—into disaster.

If you’re preparing to do a research project not because you want to but because it’s been assigned, you might think that it is just make-work and treat it as an empty exercise. We hope you won’t. Done well, your project prepares you to join the oldest and most esteemed of human conversations, one conducted for millennia among philosophers, engineers, biologists, social scientists, historians, literary critics, linguists, theologians, not to mention CEOs, lawyers, marketers, investment managers—the list is endless.

It is no exaggeration to say that, maybe not today or tomorrow but one day, the research you do and the arguments you make using it can improve if not the whole world, then at least your corner of it.

Third reason to write is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you’ll see what you really can think. Just about all of us, students and professionals alike, believe our ideas are more compelling in the dark of our minds than they turn out to be in the cold light of print.

A third reason to write is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you’ll see what you really can think. Just about all of us, students and professionals alike, believe our ideas are more compelling in the dark of our minds than they turn out to be in the cold light of print.

But the most important reason for learning to write in ways readers expect is that when you write for others, you demand more of yourself than when you write for yourself alone. By the time you fix your ideas in writing, they are so familiar to you that you need help to see them not for what you want them to be but for what they really are. You will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your readers’ inevitable and critical questions: How have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it’s relevant? What ideas have you considered but rejected?.

Some of the world’s most important research has been done by those who persevered in the face of indifference or even hostility, because they never lost faith in their vision. The geneticist Barbara McClintock struggled for years unappreciated because her research community considered her work uninteresting. But she believed in it and pressed on. When her colleagues finally realized that she had already answered questions that they were just starting to ask, she won science’s highest honor, the Nobel Prize.

Interruption of REM sleep has been shown not only to inhibit memory consolidation, especially for declarative memories, but also to significantly impair cognitive processes dependent on working memory function. If you don’t get enough sleep, not only will you struggle to retain facts and concepts, but your working memory function will also be impaired, making it difficult for you to hold information in mind and consequently to understand, think, and learn.

Since few people read formal research papers for entertainment, you have to create a relationship that encourages them to see why it’s in their interest to read yours. That’s not easy. Too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: Teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. Yours is to say whether I’ve found enough to give me a good grade. Do that and you turn your project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. Worse, you cast yourself in a role exactly opposite to that of a true researcher. In true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. When you do research, you learn something that others don’t know. So when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn’t know it but needs to and yourself as someone who will give her reason to want to know it. You must imagine a relationship that goes beyond Here are some facts I’ve dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. Are they enough of the right ones?.

You take a step toward more significant research when you can say to readers not just Here are some facts that should interest you, but These facts will help you do something to solve a problem you care about. That is the kind of research that people do every day in business, government, and the professions.

But that research itself was aimed at solving not the practical problem of keeping secrets, but the conceptual problem of not entirely understanding prime numbers. Some researchers call this kind of research “pure” as opposed to “applied.”.

Roles—I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.

You establish your side of the relationship with your readers when you adopt one of those three roles—I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.

Professionals who expect me to follow every academic convention and use a standard format?.

Help them do something to solve a practical problem in the world?.

Person’s project in this three-part sentence: I’m working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I (and you) can better understand Z.

Early on, each meeting should start with a summary of each person’s project in this three-part sentence: I’m working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I (and you) can better understand Z.

A topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that your readers care about.

Whether traits like shyness or an attraction to risk are learned or genetically inherited. But other questions may intrigue only the researcher:.

Whether traits like shyness or an attraction to risk are learned or genetically inherited. But other questions may intrigue only the researcher: Why do cats rub their faces against us? Why does a coffee spill dry up in the shape of a ring?.

A question raises a problem if not answering it keeps us from knowing something more important than its answer.

Most of us have more than enough interests, but beginners often find it hard to locate among theirs a topic focused enough to support a substantial research project. They may also believe they lack the expertise for the project. However, a research topic is an interest stated specifically enough for you to imagine becoming a local expert on it. That doesn’t mean you already know a lot about it or that you’ll have to know more about it than others, including your teacher. You just want to know a lot more about it than you do now.

Many high school teachers would reward such a paper with a good grade, because it shows that the writer can focus on a topic, find information on it, and assemble that information into a report, no small achievement—for a first project.

If a writer asks no specific question worth asking, he can offer no specific answer worth supporting.

Serious researchers, however, do not document information for its own sake, but to support the answer to a question that they (and they hope their readers) think is worth asking.

So the best way to begin working on your focused topic is not to find all the information you can on it, but to formulate questions that direct you to just that information you need to answer them.

If you are an experienced researcher, look for questions that other researchers ask but don’t answer. Many journal articles end with a paragraph or two about open questions, ideas for more research, and so on (see 4.3.2 for an example). You might not be able to do all the research they suggest, but you might carve out a piece of it. You can also look for Internet discussions on your topic, then “lurk,” just reading the exchanges to understand the kinds of questions those on the list debate. Record questions that spark your interest. You can also post questions to the list if they are specific and narrowly focused.

Some questions that seemed trivial, even silly, have answers more significant than expected. One researcher wondered why a coffee spill dries up in the form of a ring and discovered things about the properties of fluids that others in his field thought important—and that paint manufacturers found valuable. So who knows where a question about cats in the Alamo might take you? You can’t know until you get there.

In our everyday world, a problem is something we try to avoid. But in academic research, a problem is something.

In our everyday world, a problem is something we try to avoid. But in academic research, a problem is something we seek out, even invent if we have to.

As a result, beginners sometimes think that having a topic to read about is the same as having a problem to solve.

We acknowledge a problem only when we stop asking So what? and say, instead, What do we do about it?.

We call research pure when it addresses a conceptual problem that does not bear directly on any practical situation in the world, when it only improves the understanding of a community of researchers. We call research applied when it addresses a conceptual problem that does have practical consequences.

They believe that the pursuit of knowledge “for its own sake” reflects humanity’s highest calling: to know more, not for the sake of money or power, but for the transcendental good of greater understanding and a richer life of the mind. As you may have guessed,.

What distinguishes great researchers from the rest of us is the brilliance, knack, or just dumb luck of stumbling over a problem whose solution makes all of us see the world in a new way.

Nothing discourages a teacher more than a student who does exactly what is suggested and no more.

Teachers want you to use their suggestions to start your thinking, not end it. Nothing makes a teacher happier than when you use her suggestions to find something she never expected.

Disconnected from what some call the “real world.” But in business and government, in law and medicine, in politics and international diplomacy, no skill is valued more highly than the ability to recognize a.

But in business and government, in law and medicine, in politics and international diplomacy, no skill is valued more highly than the ability to recognize a problem, then to articulate it in a way that convinces others both to care about it and to believe it can be solved, especially by you. If you can do that in a class on Byzantine pottery, you can do it in an office on Main Street, Wall Street, or Queen’s Road in Hong Kong.

Keep a journal in which you reflect on your progress. This kind of writing not only helps you understand what you read but stimulates your thinking about it. The more you write early on, no matter how sketchily, the easier it will be to face that intimidating first draft.

Break the task into manageable steps and know that they are mutually supportive. Once you formulate a good question, you’ll draft and revise more effectively. The more you anticipate how you will write and revise a first draft, the more effectively you will produce it.

If you are a student, count on your teachers to understand your struggles. They want you to succeed, and you can expect their help. (If they don’t help, look for others who will.).

But if you have a question and at least one promising answer (the philosopher C. S. Peirce called it a hypothesis on probation), you can start looking for data to test it.

Change your focus and you change the classification of your sources.

The only embarrassing question is the one you failed to ask but should have.

I am working on educational policy in the 1980s 2. to find out how school boards in the Midwest dealt with desegregation, 3. because I want to understand regional differences in race relations.

You might describe your project using the three-step rubric from chapter 3: 1. I am working on educational policy in the 1980s 2. to find out how school boards in the Midwest dealt with desegregation, 3. because I want to understand regional differences in race relations.

Especially valuable at early stages of research are bibliographic works, many of which provide abstracts summarizing significant articles or books on a topic. Look, especially, for annotated bibliographies or annual literature reviews that sum up recent books or articles; these offer the most promising leads for your research.

More important, you’ll miss the benefits of serendipity—a chance encounter with a valuable source that occurs only when a title happens to catch your eye. (All of us have found important sources in this way.) If you can get into.

These practices are not necessarily nefarious, but you should remember that search engine companies and websites themselves have an interest in where you go and what you see online.

I was today years old when I realized that Google search is the start for your quest for information not an end. There is only so much Google can serve us not all much.

In general, don’t use the Internet to find secondary sources, as these depend for their credibility on the checks inherent in the academic publishing system, especially that of peer review.

Be especially careful about sources on hotly contested social issues such as stem-cell research, gun control, and global warming. Many books and articles are published by individuals or organizations driven by ideology. Libraries often include them for the sake of coverage, but don’t assume they are reliable.

Return to this question in chapter 8. Error.

These indicators do not guarantee reliability.

If haven't read the book then what are you even talking about?.

So don’t assume that you can read uncritically just because a report is written by a reputable researcher and published by a reputable press.

Don’t ignore a work on your topic that is not mentioned in the bibliographies of your most relevant sources—you will get credit for originality if you turn up a good source that others have ignored.

Don’t panic if you find a source that seems to pose and solve precisely your problem: “Transforming the Alamo Legend: History in the Service of Politics.” At that moment you might think, I’m dead. Nothing new to say. (It happened to Williams when he was writing his doctoral dissertation and to Colomb just before his first book came out.) You may be right, but probably not. If the source does in fact settle your exact question, you have to formulate a new one. But the question your source asked is probably not as close to yours as you first feared. And you may find that you can do the source one better: if the author failed to get things entirely right, you have an unwitting ally in formulating your problem.

You don’t need to script an interview around a set list of questions—in fact, that can be a bad idea if it makes the interviewee freeze up. But prepare so that you don’t question your source aimlessly. You can always reread a book for what you missed, but you can’t keep going back to people because you didn’t prepare well enough to get what you needed the first time.

Ask them about the important open questions in the field. Ask them what they think of your project or provisional thesis. Ask them to suggest secondary sources for you to read. This kind of personal guidance can be invaluable to a novice researcher, and many experts will be happy to talk with you (or at least engage in a little e-mail correspondence).

People can also lead you to good secondary sources or serve as such sources themselves.

You can also benefit from talking directly with experts on your topic. Ask them about the important open questions in the field. Ask them what they think of your project or provisional thesis. Ask them to suggest secondary sources for you to read. This kind of personal guidance can be invaluable to a novice researcher, and many experts will be happy to talk with you (or at least engage in a little e-mail correspondence).

“I don’t really have a research process; I just ask my smart friends what I should read.”.

Experienced researchers read secondary sources regularly to keep up with work in their fields, and so they usually begin their projects with a question or problem in mind.

First things first: once you decide a source is worth reading, record all of its bibliographical information. Do this before you do anything else: it only takes a moment, and we promise that no habit will serve you better for the rest of your career.

Test your understanding by summarizing: if you can’t sum up a passage in your mind, you.

Test your understanding by summarizing: if you can’t sum up a passage in your mind, you don’t understand it well enough to disagree.

So read sources not randomly but deliberately to find a problem.

You’re more likely to find a research problem when you disagree with a source, but you can also find one in sources you agree with.

Suppose you want to argue that the Alamo legend thrived because it served the political interests of those who created it and satisfied the emotional needs of those who repeated.

However, use statistical data only if you can judge for yourself whether they were collected and analyzed appropriately. (You serve yourself well if you take a course or two in statistics and probability, an area where most Americans are shamefully ignorant.).

(1) what you quote from a source, (2) what you paraphrase or summarize from a source, and (3) your own thoughts. If you are writing on paper, use headings or brackets or different colors of ink to differentiate these different kinds of note. If you are using a computer or taking notes online, use different fonts or different colors of type. We stress that you must unambiguously distinguish your own words from those of your sources because it is so easy to confuse the two.

The main reason some researchers still rely on paper notes is that they help with thinking. Since you can’t write out everything, using paper forces you to think about what’s most important.

Likewise, if your notes are on cards or sheets of paper, you can group them, shuffle them, or lay them out on a desk, a table, or even the floor. And the very act of writing out your notes can help you not only remember what’s in them but also see connections and develop your own ideas.

You can use a full reference-management system. Such systems do much more than help you organize and access your notes. They can often pull information directly from online library catalogs and databases, and they can format and update your citations and bibliographies when you write.

—The quoted words are evidence that backs up your reasons. If, for example, you claimed that different regions responded to the Battle of the Alamo differently, you would quote exact words from different newspapers. You would paraphrase them if you needed only their general sentiments.

—The words are from an authority you plan to rely on or challenge.

—The words are strikingly original or so compelling that the quotation can frame the rest of your discussion.

—The source makes a claim that you disagree with, and to be fair you want to state that claim exactly.

Never abbreviate a quotation thinking you can accurately reconstruct it later. You can’t. And if you misquote, you’ll undermine your credibility.

Students learn to do research well and report it clearly when they take the perspective of their readers and of the community whose values and practices define competent research and its reporting.

They learn to manage an important part of that mental and social process when they understand how a few key formal features of their reports influence how their readers read and judge them.

You can’t wait to plan your argument until after you’ve gathered every last bit of data and found every last relevant source. In the first place, you’ll never get them all. In the second, you’ll end up researching mechanically or aimlessly, accumulating more and more stuff with no sense of what you’ll do with it or following trails of bread crumbs who knows where. Of course, you have to do some research to get a handle on your project. But as soon as you have a sense of your problem and its likely solution, you should begin planning your argument. Your plan will change as your research progresses—if it doesn’t, you probably aren’t doing your best thinking—but making a plan early and modifying it as you go will help you grasp your material better and research more purposefully: only when you try to make a research argument that answers your readers’ predictable questions can you see what research you have yet to do.

For example, a group of physicists once wanted biologists to notice their research but were unhappy when the first manuscript they sent to a biology journal was rejected. So they started attending biology conferences, reading biology journals, even hanging around the biology department’s faculty lounge. After they figured out how biologists think, they rewrote their arguments and published papers that influenced the field.

Here are some facts about my topic; it means explaining your problem and justifying your solution in a research argument.

1. Claim: What do you want me to believe? What’s your point? 2. Reasons: Why do you say that? Why should I agree? 3. Evidence: How do you know? Can you back it up? 4. Acknowledgment and Response: But what about . . . ? 5. Warrant: How does that follow? What’s your logic? Can you explain your reasoning? In fact, you can think of your research as the process of figuring out answers to these questions.

What do higher health costs have to do with hard freezes? I don’t see the connection. To answer, you must offer a general principle that justifies relating your particular reason to your particular claim:.

Being a researcher means allowing yourself to be surprised by your discoveries and insights. So when you start a project, begin not with a claim you know you can prove but with a problem you want to explore and solve.

Ask yourself three questions: 1. What kind of claim should I make? 2. Is it specific enough? 3. Will my readers think it is significant enough to need an argument supporting it?.

If you are new to research, of course, your claim doesn’t have to challenge the experts, just impress your teacher. If you can’t predict whether it will, imagine your reader is someone like yourself. What did you think before you began your research? How much has your claim changed what you now think? What do you understand now that you didn’t before? That’s the best way to prepare for readers who will someday ask you the most devastating question any researcher can face: not Why should I believe this? but Why should I care?.

They want evidence to be accurate, precise, sufficient, representative, and authoritative.

But you can do it throughout your argument as well by anticipating, acknowledging, and responding to questions, objections, and alternatives that your readers are likely to raise along the way.

Don’t go easy on yourself with this one: the time to fix a problem with your argument is when you find it.

A warrant is a principle that connects a reason to a claim. Warrants are important because readers may challenge not just the validity of a reason but its relevance as well.

You know who your readers are, what they know, and why they should care about your problem.

You know the kind of ethos or character you want to project.

You can sketch your question and its answer in two or three sentences.

You can sketch the reasons and evidence supporting your claim. • You know the questions,.

You can sketch the reasons and evidence supporting your claim.

You know the questions, alternatives, and objections that your readers are likely to raise, and you can respond to them.

You know when your readers may not see the relevance of a reason to a claim and can state the warrant that connects them.

Research is like gold mining: dig up a lot, pick out a little, toss the rest.

Ernest Hemingway said that you know you’re writing well when you discard stuff you know is good—but not as good as what you keep.

Readers want your analysis, not a summary of your sources. Beginning researchers go wrong when they string together quotations, summaries, and loose paraphrases of sources into a patchwork that reflects little of their own thinking. Such “patch writing” invites the charge This is all summary, no analysis. It is a particular risk if you do most of your research online, because it is so easy to cut-and-paste from your sources. Experienced readers recognize patch writing, and you risk a charge of plagiarism (see 14.6).

Advanced researchers rarely offer patchwork summaries, but they can follow sources too closely in another way: they map their paper on to the organization of a major source rather than create a new one that serves their argument better. If the key terms that run through your paper are the same as those in one or more sources, consider whether you are making.

Advanced researchers rarely offer patchwork summaries, but they can follow sources too closely in another way: they map their paper on to the organization of a major source rather than create a new one that serves their argument better. If the key terms that run through your paper are the same as those in one or more sources, consider whether you are making your own argument or mimicking theirs.

Research’s most exciting moments: we discover ideas that we didn’t have until we expressed them. But like other steps in the process, even surprises happen better with a plan.

You feel so intimidated by the task that you don’t know where to begin. If so, divide the process into small tasks; then focus on one step at a time. • You have set no goals or goals that are too high. If so, create a routine that sets goals you can meet, then use devices such as a progress chart or regular meetings with a writing partner. • You feel you must make every sentence or paragraph perfect before you move to the next one. You can avoid some obsession with perfection if you write informally along the way, telling yourself you are writing only to help you think on paper. In any event, know that every researcher compromises on perfection to get the job done.

To avoid seeming to plagiarize, read the passage, look away, think about it for a moment; then still looking away, paraphrase it in your own words. Then check whether you can run your finger along your sentence and find synonyms for the same ideas in the same order in your source. If you can, try again.

The time you spend revising your introduction and conclusion may be the most important revision you do.

As we’ve said, you can always work with readers who say, I don’t agree. What you can’t survive are those who shrug and say, I don’t care.

Our suggestion: state costs or consequences when presenting your problem; state benefits to intensify your solution.

Readers will accept your claim only if they understand your argument, but they won’t understand your argument if they can’t understand your sentences.

So here are two principles of a clear style: • Express crucial actions in verbs. • Make your central characters the subjects of those verbs; keep those subjects short, concrete, and specific.


# All Hell Let Loose (Max Hastings)

Least sixty millions were terminated by death. An average of 27,000 people perished each day between September 1939 and August 1945 as a consequence of the global conflict.

Was, for example, a Hamburg woman who ardently supported Hitler, but perished in the July 1943 firestorm generated by Allied bombing, an accomplice to Nazi war guilt, or the innocent victim of an atrocity?.

Though Hitler and his followers chose to blame the Jews for the troubles of Europe and the grievances of the Third Reich, Germany’s struggle with the Allies was about power and hemispheric dominance.

About one-seventh of all fatal victims of Nazism, and almost one-tenth of all wartime dead, ultimately proved to have been Jews.

One of the most important truths about the war, as indeed about all human affairs, is that people can interpret what happens to them only in the context of their own circumstances. The fact that, objectively and statistically, the sufferings of some individuals were less terrible than those of others elsewhere in the world was meaningless to those concerned. It would have seemed monstrous to a British or American soldier facing a mortar barrage, with his comrades dying around him, to be told that Russian casualties were many times greater. It would have been insulting to invite a hungry Frenchman, or even an English housewife weary of the monotony of rations, to consider that in besieged Leningrad starving people were eating each other, while in West Bengal they were selling their daughters. Few people who endured the Luftwaffe’s 1940–41 blitz on London would have been comforted by knowledge that the German and Japanese peoples would later face losses from Allied bombing many times greater, together with unparalleled devastation. It is the duty and privilege of historians to deploy relativism in a fashion that cannot be expected of contemporary participants.

‘Muzzle caps off! Load! Safety catches on!’.

Hitler told his generals at Obersalzberg: ‘Genghis Khan had millions of women and men killed by his own will and with a light heart. History sees him only as a great state-builder … I have sent my Death’s Head units to the east with the order to kill without mercy men, women and children of the Polish race or language. Only in such a way shall we win the Lebensraum that we need.’.

The procession of wounded from the city was an unending march of death. The lights went out, and all of us, doctors and nurses, had to move about with candles in our hands. As both the operating theatres and the dressing stations were destroyed the work was done in the lecture rooms on ordinary deal tables, and owing to the lack of water the instruments could not be sterilised, but had to be cleansed with alcohol … As human wreckage was laid on the table the surgeon vainly attempted to save the lives that were slipping through his hands … Tragedy followed tragedy. At one time the victim was a girl of sixteen. She had a glorious mop of golden hair, her face was delicate as a flower, and her lovely sapphire-blue eyes were full of tears. Both her legs, up to the knees, were a mass of bleeding pulp, in which it was impossible to distinguish bone from flesh; both had to be amputated above the knee. Before the surgeon began I bent over this innocent child to kiss her pallid brow, to lay my helpless hand on her golden head. She died quietly in the course of the morning, like a flower plucked by a merciless hand.

The Nazis henceforth classified Poles as slaves, and received in return implacable hatred. As Princess Paul Sapieha crossed the frontier to precarious safety amid a throng of refugees, her small daughter asked, ‘Will there be bombs in Romania?’ The princess answered, ‘No more bombs now. There’s no war here. We’re going where it will be sunny and where children can play wherever they please.’ The child persisted: ‘But when are we going home to Papa?’ Her mother could not answer. Soon, there would be scarcely a corner of Europe that offered safe haven to either children or adults.

Though Kennedy was a shameless anglophobe, appeaser and defeatist, his question was valid, and the Allied governments had no good answer to it. After the fall of Poland, the world waited in bewilderment to discover what might follow. Since France and Britain lacked stomach to seize the initiative, the further course of the war waited upon the pleasure of Adolf Hitler.

At 0435 on 10 May, it was 0630 before Allied C-in-C.

The river seemed to absorb even the faintest glimmers of light and reflect them back a hundred times brighter, like some multi-faceted mirror.

Badly blacked-out windows, glistening rooftops, the metal hinges of doors all shone in the water.

‘It was so wonderful. I was on a ship and any ship yes any ship is England. Any ship yes any ship I was on a ship and on my way to England. It was wonderful. I kept quite still and the sea breezes I swallowed them, no smoke and burning and fire and thick grey oil smoke hazes, but sea breezes. I swallowed them they were so clean and fresh and I was alive it was so wonderful.’.

‘We are in the Geschwader of Major Molders, the most successful … During the last few days the British have been getting weaker, though individuals continue to fight well … The Hurricanes are tired old “puffers” … I am having the time of my life. I would not swap places with a king. Peacetime is going to be very boring after this!’.

‘Some men fall in love with yachts or some women, strangely enough, or motor cars, but I think every Spitfire pilot fell in love with it as soon as he sat in that nice tight cosy office with everything to hand.’.

Some day presumably we shall know – and then, more than ever, I expect, we shall salute the gallant men who are now doing such untold service for their country.’.

Hitler had abandoned hopes of occupying Britain in 1940, and also of destroying.

Human beings measure risk and privation within the compass of their personal knowledge.

Human beings measure risk and privation within the compass of their personal knowledge. It was meaningless to assert to an English suburban housewife that Poles, Jews, French refugees, and later soldiers on the Eastern Front suffered much worse things than herself.

Hitler’s air assault on Britain ranks second only to the invasion of Russia among his great blunders of the war.

Kannst nicht Treue sein’ – ‘You Cannot be Faithful’. In 1936, when a foolish woman at a party asked Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg who would win the next war, he is alleged to have answered, ‘Madam, I cannot tell you that. Only one thing I can say: whoever.

In 1936, when a foolish woman at a party asked Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg who would win the next war, he is alleged to have answered, ‘Madam, I cannot tell you that. Only one thing I can say: whoever has Italy on his side is bound to lose.’ There was a contemptuous joke in Nazi Party circles of Hitler’s lackey Wilhelm Keitel reporting, ‘My Führer, Italy has entered the war!’ Hitler answers, ‘Send two divisions. That should be enough to finish them.’ Keitel says, ‘No, my Führer, not against us, but with us.’ Hitler says, ‘That’s different. Send ten divisions.’.

An old woman, who had lost her eldest son Stathi in Albania, began to sob. A café owner urged her now to check her tears for the Italians: ‘They were the ones who killed your son.’ She ignored him, and ran to a soldier torn open by shrapnel, who lay crying: ‘Bread, mother!’ The old woman tried to wash his wounds with a cloth dipped in raki, still sobbing and talking to the man: ‘Don’t cry, Stathi. Yes, I am your mother. Don’t cry. I’ve got both bread and milk.’.

‘The Australians regarded themselves as the best fighters in the world,’ wrote a British officer. ‘They were.’ He added that their units were held together by ‘mateship’, almost always a stronger motivation for.

‘The Australians regarded themselves as the best fighters in the world,’ wrote a British officer. ‘They were.’ He added that their units were held together by ‘mateship’, almost always a stronger motivation for successful soldiers than any abstract cause.

Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union was the defining event of the war, just as the Holocaust was the defining act of Nazism.

Germany embarked upon an attempt to fulfil the most ambitious objectives in its history, to push back the frontiers of Slavdom.

Germany embarked upon an attempt to fulfil the most ambitious objectives in its history, to push back the frontiers of Slavdom and create a new empire in the east.

‘Many, perhaps most Germans, and certainly most German intellectuals, saw the First World War as a battle for cultural survival against the converging forces of Russian barbarism and, far more subversive, the decadent civilisation of the West, embodied no longer by French aristocrats but by the materialist societies of the Anglo-Saxon world. This belief was taken over in its entirety by the Nazis and provided the bedrock of their own philosophy.’.

‘We are approaching the greatest horror … Everyone is preoccupied with only one thought: where to get something edible so as not to starve to death. We have returned to prehistoric times. Life has been reduced to one thing – the hunt for food.’.

Many of those with energy to read turned to War and Peace, the only book that seemed capable of explaining their agony.

Many of those with energy to read turned to War and Peace, the only book that seemed capable of explaining their agony. Those who survived had not merely exceptional will, but also commitment to a routine: washing themselves, eating off plates, even continuing academic studies. The authorities considered transporting civilians to safety on trucks returning empty across Lake Ladoga. Some mothers and babies indeed travelled, and often died en route; but Stalin rejected a wholesale evacuation, for prestige reasons.

Whatever the merits of the Russian people’s struggle to expel the invaders from their country, Stalin’s war aims were as selfish and inimical to human liberty as those of Hitler. Soviet conduct could be deemed less barbaric than that of the Nazis only because it embraced no single enormity to match the Holocaust. Nonetheless, the Western Allies were obliged to declare their gratitude, because Russia’s suffering and sacrifice saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of young British and American soldiers. Even if no exalted assertion of principle – instead, only a grapple between rival monsters – caused Russia to become the principal battleground of the war, it was there that the Third Reich encountered the forces that would contrive its nemesis.

The chief character in J.P. Marquand’s contemporary novel So Little Time says: ‘You could get away from the war for a little while, but not for long, because it was everywhere, even in the sunlight. It lay behind everything you said or did. You could taste it in your food, you could hear it in music.’.


# How to Find Out Anything: From Extreme Google Searches to Scouring Government Documents, a Guide to Uncovering Anything About Everyone and Everything (Don Macleod)

This book will address the single most common misconception of the Information Age: that Google is the be-all and end-all of research.

“The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.”.

But don’t throw your hands up in frustration and disgust just yet. Instead, let’s recast that open-ended question into a series of factual questions that you can answer. How much did CEO Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems earn in 2007? What was the average salary paid to the chief executive officers at the ten largest computer companies in the past five years? Who is an expert on computer industry compensation whom I can interview and quote? What books can I consult that discuss compensation trends in the software industry?.

As I’ll show in later chapters, you can answer these factual questions by searching public records databases, scrutinizing library catalogs, talking to associations, and conducting in-depth Google searches.

So how do you turn those hazy, unanswerable, open-ended questions into something you can work with? To determine exactly what someone is looking for, professional librarians conduct a reference interview. A reference interview is the formal process by which an answerable question is extracted from a general description of what a person is looking for.

The lawyer was asking for what he thought he needed—the annual report, the proxy, and the quarterly report—rather than for what he actually needed, which was a discrete piece of information contained in precisely none of the documents he asked me to send to him.

You should start, instead, by asking a series of factual questions: When was the digital camera invented? Which professional photographers used to photograph with film cameras and now shoot in digital? What companies produce digital cameras? What difference does it make if you produce a photo using software rather than a traditional chemical darkroom? What do experts in the field think about the shift from film to pixels?.

Observe the rule that professionals follow: Never compile information yourself if someone else has already done it.

Putting together a list of manufacturers is exactly the type of information that a manufacturers association would collect and make public.

The oldest joke in the research world is to tell a patron, “I can get it for you fast, cheap, and accurate. Pick two.”.

Traditional newspapers, broadcast news, and mainstream websites take pains to build their reputations for credibility. That’s why they hire fact checkers and copy editors and reporters who take care to get their information straight.

“A lie can travel halfway round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes”.

It is not an opinion that the sky is blue; it’s a fact—a fact as verifiable in Russia as it is in Uruguay and Canada.

The excitement of research comes when a little bit of knowledge leads to even more, and one of the best secrets of good research is the ability to use one bit of information (or document or website or article or name) to find even more information.

Footnotes, callouts, and references to other works are the hidden gems that researchers should read as closely as the primary text. Don’t ignore them.

If the person quoted in an article has an opinion that you either like, want to challenge, or need to learn more about, note his or her affiliation. You might find additional information on the person’s company, university, or association site.

Most websites and blogs offer additional links or blog rolls. Check them out. If the webmaster sees value in adding a link, there likely is something of value to you in following it.

Always ask for more information: Whether you are speaking to a person face-to-face or are engaged in an email conversation, never fail to ask where else you should be looking for additional information. People love to talk; you’ll find that asking for advice can produce tips for finding more information quickly.

Whether you are speaking to a person face-to-face or are engaged in an email conversation, never fail to ask where else you should be looking for additional information. People love to talk; you’ll find that asking for advice can produce tips for finding more information quickly.

Resist the urge to Google everything. As you’ll see in the next chapter, not only is Google quite limited in the information that it can provide but a strict reliance on Google cuts you off from the expertise of people with whom you can have a conversation. Picking up the phone to speak with the right person can sometimes get you an answer faster than even the fastest computer can.

When you’re looking for information, keep in mind that everything is guilty until proven truthful. Skepticism (not cynicism) is the ally of the researcher. You should always weigh the credibility of any source in light of what you already know and never take a fact, opinion, or conclusion at face value until you can verify it.

“If he says his mother loved him, check it out with her.”.

They didn’t nickname the lions in front of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue Patience and Fortitude for nothing. Tenacity is as much a tool of successful research as curiosity and intelligence.

Does this author know what the heck she is talking about? Is this information accurate? Is it free from bias? If the author is making a point, does the reasoning hold up or does the author make specious claims? Has care been taken to write clearly and grammatically? In short, reading through a list of Google results is first and foremost an exercise in making choices about which results promise to answer your questions and which should be dismissed as unworthy of your attention.

From a giant blind spot concerning the deep web. The term deep web refers to the universe of web-accessible information locked away in databases where Google’s spidering computers can’t see it. That limitation is a very serious knock against Google and the most important reason for never depending on it exclusively for online information.

Web design matured. Most sites were designed to pull information from a database. No longer were sites created from hard-coded text. Instead, they produced information on the fly, pulled from a database, in response to user queries. Suddenly, search engines didn’t look as omnipotent as they once did. These days, the bulk of the interesting data is in the database, not on a web page where Google’s computers can find it.

In Googlespeak, a space between search terms is always interpreted as the word and.

“The richest person in the world—in fact all the riches in the world—couldn’t provide you with anything like the endless, incredible loot available at your local library.”.

An old joke holds there are three types of people in the world: those who can count and those who can’t.

Twelve responses to my question. “It’s boustrophedonic!”.

If you want to convince a large oil company to stop drilling in the middle of dolphin breeding grounds, it would be helpful to have a source for the company’s legal name, state of incorporation, mailing address, and the correct spelling of the CEO’s name.

Few things are truly hidden anymore. It was romantic once to know about something that no else did, like a rare jazz record or an undiscovered gem of a book.


# Looking for Alaska (John Green)

'I go to seek a Great Perhaps.' That's why I'm going. So I don't have to wait until I die to start seeking a Great Perhaps.”.

Chip did not believe in having a sock drawer or a T-shirt drawer. He believed that all drawers were created equal and filled each with whatever fit. My mother would have died.

You can say a lot of bad things about Alabama, but you can't say that Alabamans as a people are unduly afraid of deep fryers.

“Because I went ahead and smelled them, and yes, I am sure. If there's one thing I know, it's when I've just stepped in another man's piss. It's like my mom always says: `Ya think you's a-walkin' on water, but turns out you just got piss in your shoes.' Point those guys out to me if you see them today,” he added, “because we need to figure out why they're so, uh, pissed at me. And then we need to go ahead and start thinking about how we're going to ruin their miserable little lives.”.

Because you may be smart, but I've been smart longer. I'm sure some of you do not like lecture classes, but as you have probably noted, I'm not as young as I used to be. I would love to spend my remaining breath chatting with you about the finer points of Islamic history, but our time together is short. I must talk, and you must listen, for we are engaged here in the most important pursuit in history: the search for meaning. What is the nature of being a person? What is the best way to go about being a person? How did we come to be, and what will become of us when we are no longer?.

“For fifty minutes a day, five days a week, you abide by my rules. Or you fail. The choice is yours. Both of you leave.”.

But my teachers had always been card-carrying members of the Miles Halter Fan Club.

When Alaska Young is sitting with her legs crossed in a brittle, periodically green clover patch leaning forward in search of four-leaf clovers, the pale skin of her sizable cleavage clearly visible, it is a plain fact of human physiology that it becomes impossible to join in her clover search. I'd gotten in enough trouble already for looking where I wasn't supposed to, but still.

“You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.”.

So this is how noah felt. You wake up one morning and God has forgiven you and you walk around squinting all day because you've forgotten how sunlight feels warm and rough against your skin like a kiss on the cheek from your dad, and the whole world is brighter and cleaner than ever before, like central Alabama has been put in the washing machine for two weeks and cleaned with extra-superstrength detergent with color brightener, and now the grass is greener and the bufriedos are crunchier.

“Nothing's wrong. But there's always suffering, Pudge. Homework or malaria or having a boyfriend who lives far away when there's a good-looking boy lying next to you. Suffering is universal. It's the one thing Buddhists, Christians, and Muslims are all worried about.”.

Just like that. From a hundred miles an hour to asleep in a nanosecond. I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together, in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was a hurricane.

Pulling onto a road that dropped precipitously.

“I hope you didn't bring the Asian kid along thinking he's a computer genius. Because I am not,” Takumi said.

Indefuckingstructible.”.

"Best day of my life hasn't happened yet. But I know it. I see it every day. The best day of my life is the day I buy my mom a huge fucking house. And not just like out in the woods, but in the middle of Mountain Brook, with all the Weekday Warriors' parents. With all y'all's parents. And I'm not buying it with a mortgage either. I'm buying it with cash money, and I am driving my mom there, and I'm going to open her side of the car door and she'll get out and look at this house—this house is like picket fence and two stories and everything, you know—and I'm going to hand her the keys to her house and I'll say, 'Thanks.' Man, she helped fill out my application to this place.

There comes a time when we realize that our parents cannot save themselves or save us, that everyone who wades through time eventually gets dragged out to sea by the undertow—that, in short, we are all going.

There's your labyrinth of suffering. We are all going. Find your way out of that maze.

And what is an “instant” death anyway? How long is an instant? Is it one second? Ten? The pain of those seconds must have been awful as her heart burst and her lungs collapsed and there was no air and no blood to her brain and only raw panic. What the hell is instant? Nothing is instant. Instant rice takes five minutes, instant pudding an hour. I doubt that an instant of blinding pain feels particularly instantaneous.

Buddhism, particularly as it is popularly practiced, promises improvement through karma. Islam and Christianity promise eternal paradise to the faithful. And that is a powerful opiate, certainly, the hope of a better life to come.

To seventh-century Arabia, Muhammad brought the promise that anyone could find fulfillment and everlasting life through allegiance to the one true God. The Buddha held out hope that suffering could be transcended. Jesus brought the message that the last shall be first, that even the tax collectors and lepers—the outcasts—had cause for hope. And so that is the question I leave you with in this final: What is your cause for hope?”.

When adults say, “Teenagers think they are invincible” with that sly, stupid smile on their faces, they don't know how right they are. We need never be hopeless, because we can never be irreparably broken. We think that we are invincible because we are. We cannot be born, and we cannot die.

So I know she forgives me, just as I forgive her. Thomas Edison's last words were: “It's very beautiful over there.” I don't know where there is, but I believe it's somewhere, and I hope it's beautiful.

Our profit margins are under real pressure from many factors, including the higher costs of developing new reserves, less oil found per foot drilled, rising inflationary costs of doing business, oversupply of crude, crude oil price volatility, competition for oil company investments, competition for acreage/concessions, competition for funds, and overall business risk and uncertainty.

Highly capital-intensive, and risky industries.

Te planning function is classifed into long-term strategic plans and short-term tactical plans. Strategic plans provide a broader view of activities focusing on objectives and goals over a longer time period, say, from 5 to 10 years. Te tactical plans provide a detailed view of the activities focusing on the means to attain goals.

In normal petroleum operations, the value of b ranges between 0 and 1.0, with b = 0 being an exponential decline and b = 1.0 being a harmonic decline (special case of hyperbolic decline). However, it is found that in fractured tight (low-permeability) formations, exponents in excess of 1.0 may be calculated. Care should be exercised in these cases, as a high value for b will result in an unrealistically low decline rate late in the well life. Te following equations are used to interpret hyperbolic decline curves. Several methods are available to evaluate the hyperbolic exponent b. Tree of the most commonly used methods are (1) French curve method, (2) shifing the curve on log-log graph paper, and (3) type-curve ftting method. Only the frst two methods are presented here. Other methods are described in technical journals such as the Journal of Petroleum Technology and the Oil & Gas Journal. 4–8 French curve method: A French curve is a template made in the shape of a hyperbolic curve that is used to draw smooth curve shapes. Tis is a preferred method because it is easy to use, gives comparable results, and is not time consuming. Te following steps should be followed: 1. Plot the monthly production data on a semi-logarithmic graph paper. 2. With the help of a French curve, draw a best-ft curve through the plotted data. 3. Select a point qi on this curve and draw a line tangent to the curve at this point. 4. Compute the eﬀective decline rate, d, per year and compute a i = –ln(1– d). 5. Select another point qt at some point t from the initial rate qi, and try diﬀerent values of b in equation (3.11) until a value of b is found that gives a qt value close to the one selected. Tis trial-and-error calculation can be easily done with the help of a programmable calculator. (3.9) (3.10).

Payback period Te payback period, also referred to as the breakeven point, is defned as the expected number of years required for recovering the original investment. At this point, the cash receipts exactly equal the cash disbursements. Tis yardstick is used along with at least one other measure of proftability.

Net present value (NPV) Te net present value (NPV), also referred to as the present value of cash surplus or present worth, is obtained by subtracting the present value of periodic cash outﬂows from the present value of periodic cash inﬂows. Te present value is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital of the investor, also referred to as the discount rate or minimum acceptable rate of return. Te discount rate should reﬂect the value of the alternative use of funds. What is an alternative use of funds? Money has value regardless of how it is utilized. If it is kept in a bank savings account, it earns interest; if it is kept in a mattress, it loses real value with time because of the missed opportunity of earning interest. For example, if $100,000 invested in a bank earning 5% interest is withdrawn for investing it in another project, the 5% becomes the cost of capital or the opportunity cost of the $100,000 that is forgone by investing it in another project. Te bank account is the alternative use of funds. Terefore, when evaluating the project it must generate at least 5% to break even with the returns from the bank account. Te risk factor also comes into play (if return from the project is riskier than the return on the bank account, then some risk premium more than the 5% return is desired). When the NPV of an investment at a certain discount rate is positive, it pays for the cost of fnancing the investment or the cost of the alternative use of funds. Te investment generates revenue that is equal to the positive present value. It also implies the rate of return on the investment is at least equal to the discount rate. Conversely, a negative NPV indicates the investment is not generating earnings equivalent to those expected from the alternative use of funds, thus causing opportunity loss. Te net present value method of evaluating the desirability of investments is mathematically represented by the following equation. (6.3) OR (6.3a).

Te defnition of PI implies that projects with the largest PI values generate the largest cumulative NPV that can be accumulated from the available present worth investment dollars (i.e., the higher the PI, the better the investment). A variation to the defnition of the proftability index is the present value ratio (PVR), present value index (PVI), discounted proftto-investment ratio (DPIR), or investment efciency. Te PVR is the ratio of the NPV to the present value of capital investment rather than the ratio of the PV of future operating cash ﬂows to the PV of capital investment. Mathematically, this relationship is represented by the following equation. (6.8).

Te PI generates a number greater than one (1.0) for investments with a positive NPV and a number less than one for investments with a negative NPV. Te decision rules for use of the PI are.


# Why Uber Is an Economist’s Dream (Ep. 258) - Freakonomics (freakonomics.com)

And consumer surplus is one of the most important things in economics. One of the incredible beauties of the market system is that for so much of what we buy, we would have been willing to pay way more for it than we actually have to. A great example is water. How much do we pay for water each month? I don’t know what your water bill is. Mine is maybe $40. But think about how much we’d be willing to pay for water. Water is — I mean we’d be willing to pay almost anything for water, but it’s really, really cheap. So in that way, the modern economy has arranged things so that we get things we need — like water and food — much more cheaply than we’d be willing to pay. And that is really important. That is really the magic of the market.

You have never been more right about anything in your life than what you just said.

An inelastic demand is a sign that people are not very sensitive to price.

The most important thing, though, is that there are double rations of tobacco as well. Ten cigars, twenty cigarettes and two plugs of chewing tobacco for everyone, and that’s a decent amount. I’ve swapped my chewing tobacco with Katczinsky for his cigarettes, and that gives me forty. You can last a day on that.

Incidentally, it’s funny how often the miseries of this world are caused by short people – they are so much more quick-tempered and difficult to get on with than tall ones.

In fact, one of our class was reluctant, and didn’t really want to go with us. That was Josef Behm, a tubby, cheerful chap. But in the end he let himself be persuaded, because he would have made things impossible for himself by not going. Maybe others felt the same way as he did; but it wasn’t easy to stay out of it because at that time even our parents used the word ‘coward’ at the drop of a hat. People simply didn’t have the slightest idea of what was coming. As a matter of fact it was the poorest and simplest people who were the most sensible; they saw the war as a disaster right from the start, whereas those who were better off were overjoyed about it, although they of all people should have been in a far better position to see the implications.

As a matter of fact it was the poorest and simplest people who were the most sensible; they saw the war as a disaster right from the start, whereas those who were better off were overjoyed about it, although they of all people should have been in a far better position to see the implications. Katczinsky says it is all to do with education – it softens the brain. And if Kat says something, then he has given it some thought. Oddly enough, Behm was one of the first to be killed. He was shot in the eye during an attack, and we left him for dead. We couldn’t take him with us because we had to get back in a great rush ourselves. That afternoon we suddenly heard him shout out and saw him crawling around in no man’s land. He had only been knocked unconscious. Because he couldn’t see and was mad with pain he didn’t take cover, so he was shot down from the other side before anyone could get out to fetch him. That can’t be linked directly with Kantorek, of course – where would we be if that counted as actual guilt? Anyway, there were thousands of Kantoreks, all of them convinced that they were acting for the best, in the way that was the most comfortable for themselves. But as far as we are concerned, that is the very root of their moral bankruptcy. They were supposed to be the ones who would help us eighteen-year-olds to make the transition, who would guide us into adult life, into a world of work, of responsibilities, of civilized behaviour and progress – into the future. Quite often we ridiculed them and played tricks on them, but basically we believed in them. In our minds the idea of authority – which is what they represented – implied deeper insights and a more humane wisdom. But the first dead man that we saw shattered this conviction. We were forced to recognize that our generation was more honourable than theirs; they only had the advantage of us in phrase-making and in cleverness. Our first experience of heavy artillery fire showed us our mistake, and the view of life that their teaching had given us fell to pieces under that bombardment. While they went on writing and making speeches, we saw field hospitals and men dying: while they preached the service of the state as the greatest thing, we already knew that the fear of death is even greater. This didn’t make us into rebels or deserters, or turn us into cowards – and they were more than ready to use all of those words – because we loved our country just as much as they did, and so we went bravely into every attack. But now we were able to distinguish things clearly, all at once our eyes had been opened. And we saw that there was nothing left of their world. Suddenly we found ourselves horribly alone – and we had to come to terms with it alone as well.

I remember the day when we were drafted out. His mother, a pleasant, stout woman, saw him off at the station. She was crying all the time, and her face was puffy and swollen. This embarrassed Kemmerich, because she was the least composed of all of them, practically dissolving in fat and tears. What’s more, she picked me out, and kept grabbing my arm and begging me to keep an eye on Franz when we got out here. As it happens, he did have a very young face, and his bones were so soft that after just a month of carrying a pack he got flat feet. But how can you keep an eye on someone on a battlefield?.

They think, those hundred thousand Kantoreks.

If the boots were any use at all to Kemmerich, Müller would sooner walk barefoot over barbed-wire than give a single thought to getting them. But as it is, the boots are objects which now have nothing to do with Kemmerich’s condition, whereas Müller can do with them. Kemmerich is going to die, whoever gets them. So why shouldn’t Müller try and get hold of them – after all, he has more right to them than some orderly. Once Kemmerich is dead it will be too late. That’s why Müller is keeping an eye on them now. We have lost all our ability to see things in other ways, because they are artificial. For us, it is only the facts that count. And good boots are hard to come by.

We came to realize – first with astonishment, then bitterness, and finally with indifference – that intellect apparently wasn’t the most important thing, it was the kit-brush; not ideas, but the system; not freedom, but drill. We had joined up with enthusiasm and with good will; but they did everything to knock that out of us. After three weeks it no longer struck us as odd that an ex-postman with a couple of stripes should have more power over us than our parents ever had, or our teachers, or the whole course of civilization from Plato to Goethe. With our young, wide-open eyes we saw that the classical notion of patriotism we had heard from our teachers meant, in practical terms at that moment, surrendering our individual personalities more completely than we would ever have believed possible even in the most obsequious errand boy. Saluting, eyes front, marching, presenting arms, right and left about, snapping to attention, insults and a thousand varieties of bloody-mindedness – we had imagined that our task would be rather different from all this, but we discovered that we were being trained to be heroes the way they train circus horses, and we quickly got used to it. We even understood that some of these things were necessary, but that others, by the same token, were completely superfluous. Soldiers soon sort out which is which.

Have to take the mickey.’.

Kropp, on the other hand, is more philosophical. He reckons that all declarations of war ought to be made into a kind of festival, with entrance tickets and music, like they have at bullfights. Then the ministers and generals of the two countries would have to come into the ring, wearing boxing shorts, and armed with rubber truncheons, and have a go at each other. Whoever is left on his feet, his country is declared the winner. That would be simpler and fairer than things are out here, where the wrong people are fighting each other.

‘It isn’t just Himmelstoss, there are loads of them. As soon as they get a couple of stripes or a pip or two they turn into entirely different people and start behaving as if they chew iron bars for breakfast.’.

For me, the front is as sinister as a whirlpool. Even when you are a long way away from its centre, out in calm waters, you can still feel its suction pulling you towards it, slowly, inexorably, meeting little resistance.

The earth is more important to the soldier than to anybody else. When he presses himself to the earth, long and violently, when he urges himself deep into it with his face and with his limbs, under fire and with the fear of death upon him, then the earth is his only friend, his brother, his mother, he groans out his terror and screams into its silence and safety, the earth absorbs it all and gives him another ten seconds of life, ten seconds to run, then takes hold of him again – sometimes for ever.

It is simply a matter of chance whether I am hit or whether I go on living. I can be squashed flat in a bomb-proof dugout, and I can survive ten hours in the open under heavy barrage without a scratch. Every soldier owes the fact that he is still alive to a thousand lucky chances and nothing else. And every soldier believes in and trusts to chance.

We are like children who have been abandoned and we are as experienced as old men, we are coarse, unhappy and superficial – I think that we are lost.

Because one thing has become clear to me: you can cope with all the horror as long as you simply duck thinking about it – but it will kill you if you try to come to terms with it.

In the same way that we turn into animals when we go up the line, because it is the only way we can survive, when we are back behind the lines we become superficial jokers and idlers. We can’t do anything about it – it’s compulsive. We want to go on living at any price, and therefore we can’t burden ourselves with emotions that might be all very nice to have in peacetime, but are out of place here.

‘It’s funny when you think about it,’ continues Kropp. ‘We’re out here defending our homeland. And yet the French are there defending their homeland as well. Which of us is right?’ ‘Maybe both,’ I say, though I don’t believe it. ‘Well then,’ says Albert, and I can see that he is trying to drive me into a corner, ‘our teachers and preachers and newspapers all tell us that we are the only ones with right on our side, and let’s hope it’s true – but the French teachers and preachers and newspapers all insist that they are the only ones in the right. How does that figure?’.

Hours. The gurgling starts up again – how long it takes for a man to die! What I do know is that he is beyond saving. To be sure, I have tried to convince myself otherwise, but by midday this self-delusion has melted away, has been shot to pieces by his groans. If I hadn’t lost my revolver when I was crawling along I would shoot him. I can’t stab him.

Everything must have been fraudulent and pointless if thousands of years of civilization weren’t even able to prevent this river of blood, couldn’t stop these torture chambers existing in their hundreds of thousands. Only a military hospital can really show you what war is.

I am young, I am twenty years of age; but I know nothing of life except despair, death, fear, and the combination of completely mindless superficiality with an abyss of suffering. I see people being driven against one another, and silently, uncomprehendingly, foolishly, obediently and innocently killing one another. I see the best brains in the world inventing weapons and words to make the whole process that much more sophisticated and long-lasting. And watching this with me are all my contemporaries, here and on the other side, all over the world – my whole generation is experiencing this with me. What would our fathers do if one day we rose up and confronted them, and called them to account? What do they expect from us when a time comes in which there is no more war? For years our occupation has been killing – that was the first experience we had. Our knowledge of life is limited to death. What will happen afterwards? And what can possibly become of us?.

We’ve stopped counting the weeks. It was winter when I arrived, and whenever a shell hit the ground, the frozen clumps of earth it sent up were almost as dangerous as the shrapnel. Now the trees are green again. Our lives move between base camp and front line. To an extent we have become used to it. War is another cause of death, like cancer or tuberculosis or influenza or dysentery. The fatalities are just much more numerous, and more horrible.

Never do anything in secret or anything that you would wish to hide. For the desire to hide anything means that you are afraid, and fear is a bad thing and unworthy of you. Be brave, and all the rest follows. If you are brave, you will not fear and will not do anything of which you are ashamed.

Why should we shout “Inqilab zindabad”? Why should we want revolution and change? India of course wants a big change today. But even after the big change that we all want has come and India is independent, we cannot rest quiescent. Nothing in the world that is alive remains unchanging. All Nature changes from day to day and minute to minute, only the dead stop growing and are quiescent. Fresh water runs on, and if you stop it, it becomes stagnant. So also is it with the life of man and the life of a nation. Whether we want to or not, we grow old.

Let us go back to old India. You know that what is Afghanistan today was then, and for a long time afterwards, a part of India. The north-west of India was called Gandhara.

Let us go back to old India. You know that what is Afghanistan today was then, and for a long time afterwards, a part of India. The north-west of India was called Gandhara. All over the north, in the plains of the Indus and the Ganges, there were big settlements of the Aryans. These Aryan immigrants probably knew the art of building well, for many of them must have come from the Aryan settlements in Persia and Mesopotamia, where there were great cities even then.

The old tradition tells us that the first Aryan to go to the south was the Rishi Agastya who carried the message of Aryan religion and culture to the Deccan.

Those early days were the great period of the Aryans in India. Unfortunately we have no history of this period, and can only rely on non-historical books for such facts as we know.

Stories of their valour and chivalry.

The many things that culture includes are certainly restraint over oneself and consideration for others.

If a person has not got this self-restraint and has no consideration for others, one can certainly say that he is uncultured.

So you have read many books from the library and want me to suggest more. But you do not tell me what you have read. It is a good habit to read books, but I rather suspect those who read too many books quickly. I suspect them of not reading them properly at all, of just skimming through them, and forgetting them the day after. If a book is worth reading it is worth reading with some care and thoroughness.

There is reason in what you say, but you ought not to see danger everywhere or to reckon every risk. If whatever comes up you are going to weigh everything alike, you will never do anything. It is better to be always an optimist and to suffer half the amount of evil, than always to be full of gloomy anticipations and never suffer anything at all. If you attack every proposal made without showing us the right course to follow, you will come to grief as much as those whom you oppose. The scales are evenly balanced. How can a human being know certainly which way they will incline? He cannot. But success generally attends those who wish to act; and it does not attend those who are timid and balance everything. You see the great power which Persia has attained. If my predecessors on the throne had held your views, or without holding them had had counsellors like you, you would never have seen our kingdom become so great. It is by taking risks that they made us what we are. Great things are achieved through great dangers.

Herodotus thought over it and drew a moral from it. He says that a nation’s history has three stages: success; then as a consequence of success, arrogance and injustice; and then, as a consequence of these, downfall.

To him the only thing worth having was true knowledge, and he often discussed difficult questions with his friends and acquaintances, so that out of the discussions truth might emerge. He had many disciples or chelas, and the greatest of these was Plato. Plato wrote many books which have come down to us, and it is from these books that we know a great deal of his master, Socrates. Evidently governments do not like people who are always trying to find out things; they do not like the search for truth. The Athenian Government—this was just after the time of Pericles—did not like the methods of Socrates, and they held a trial and condemned him to death. They told him that if he promised to give up his discussions with people and changed his ways they would let him off. But he refused to do so and preferred the cup of poison, which brought him death, to giving up what he considered his duty. On the point of death almost he addressed his accusers and judges, the Athenians, and said: If you propose to acquit me on condition that I abandon my search for truth, I will say: I thank you, O Athenians, but I will obey God, who as I believe set me this task, rather than you, and so long as I have breath and strength I will never cease from my occupation with philosophy. I will continue the practice of accosting whomever I meet and saying to him, “Are you not ashamed of setting your heart on wealth and honours while you have no care for wisdom and truth and making your soul better?” I know not what death is—it may be a good thing, and I am not afraid of it. But I do know that it is a bad thing to desert one’s post and I prefer what may be good to what I know to be bad. In life Socrates served the cause of truth and knowledge well, but better.

To him the only thing worth having was true knowledge, and he often discussed difficult questions with his friends and acquaintances, so that out of the discussions truth might emerge. He had many disciples or chelas, and the greatest of these was Plato. Plato wrote many books which have come down to us, and it is from these books that we know a great deal of his master, Socrates. Evidently governments do not like people who are always trying to find out things; they do not like the search for truth. The Athenian Government—this was just after the time of Pericles—did not like the methods of Socrates, and they held a trial and condemned him to death. They told him that if he promised to give up his discussions with people and changed his ways they would let him off. But he refused to do so and preferred the cup of poison, which brought him death, to giving up what he considered his duty.

So died Alexander at the age of thirty-three. What had this “great” person done during his brief career? He won some brilliant battles. He was undoubtedly a great general. But he was vain and conceited, and sometimes very cruel and violent. He thought of himself almost as a god. In fits of anger or whims of the moment he killed some of his best friends, and destroyed great cities together with their inhabitants. He left nothing solid behind him in his empire—not even proper roads— that he had built. Like a meteor in the sky he came and went, and left little of himself behind him except a memory. His family people killed each other off after his death, and his great empire fell to pieces. A world-conqueror he is called, and it is said that once he sat down and wept because there was nothing more left for him to conquer! But India, except for a little bit in the north-west, was still unconquered by him; and China even then was a great State, and Alexander went nowhere near China.

Only the well-read know anything of Socrates or Plato or Phidias or Sophocles or the other great men of Greece. But who has not heard of Alexander?.

According to H.G. Wells, he is the only military monarch on record who abandoned warfare after victory.

It is an amazing thing how much human beings will put up with, but there is a limit to human endurance, and when this is reached there are burst-ups.

Kaiser and Tsar are derived from this same word “Caesar”.

So Julius Caesar’s name has become a word of imperial grandeur. What would have happened if Pompey had beaten him at Pharsalus in Greece? Probably Pompey then would have become princeps or emperor, and the word Pompey might have come to mean emperor. We would then have had the German Pompey (Wilhelm II); and even King George might have become Pompey-i-Hind!.

A schoolboy or schoolgirl today knows far more of geography than the great generals and the wise men of the Roman Senate knew, although they considered themselves masters of the world. And just as they considered themselves masters of the world, some thousands of miles away, across the great continent of Asia, the rulers of China also considered themselves the masters of the world.

Brahminism ultimately succeeded in almost driving out Buddhism from the country of its birth by assimilating it to some extent and absorbing it and trying to find a place for it in its own house.

When the Aryans first came to India they assimilated much of Dravidian culture and custom, and all through their history they have, consciously or unconsciously, acted in this way. They did likewise with Buddhism, and made of Buddha an avatar and a god—one of many in the Hindu pantheon. Buddha remained a person to be worshipped and adored by the multitude, but his special message was quietly put aside, and Brahminism or Hinduism, with minor variations, continued the.

But there is one other strong resemblance between the Romans and the English people—they are both singularly devoid of imagination! Smug and self-satisfied, and convinced that the world was made specially for their benefit, they go through life untroubled by doubt or difficulty.

It is possible that some of our Rajput clans of Central India and Rajputana have a trace of this White Hun blood.

The person or the country having a better tool, or a better or cheaper method of making any article, is bound, in the long run, to drive out another person or country which has not got as good a tool or as good a method. And this is the reason why Europe has gone ahead of Asia during the last 200 years. New discoveries and inventions gave Europe new and powerful tools and new methods of manufacture. With the help of these she captured the markets of the world and became rich and powerful.

Man, a great man once said, is a tool-making animal.

And man’s history, from the earliest days to the present, is a history of more and more efficient tools—from the early stone arrows and hammers of the Stone Age to the railway and steam-engine and the enormous machines of today. Indeed, almost everything we do requires a tool. Where would we be without tools?.

It is difficult for an appeal to the mind and to the intellect to go far. Most people unfortunately do not think: they feel and act according to their feelings.

Their idea seems to have been that the more they suffered and the less they washed the holier they became.

Certainly the world is more civilized and cultured now. Why, then, do we relapse back into barbarism during periods of war? Because war itself is a negation and denial of civilization and culture, except in so far as it takes advantage of the civilized brain to invent and use more and more powerful and horrible weapons. With the coming of war most people who are involved in it work themselves up into a terrible state of excitement, forget much that civilization has taught them, forget truth and the graces of life, and begin to resemble their savage ancestors of a few thousand years ago. Is it, then, surprising that war, whenever waged, is a horrible thing? What would a stranger to this world of ours say if he were to visit us during war-time? Suppose he only saw us then, and not during peacetime. He would only judge by the war, and come to the conclusion that we were cruel and relentless savages, occasionally showing courage and sacrifice, but, on the whole, with few redeeming features, and with one master-passion—to kill and destroy each other. He would misjudge us and form a distorted view of our world, because he would see only one side of us at a particular, and not very favourable, time. So also, if we think of the past in terms of wars and massacres only, we shall misjudge it. Unfortunately wars and massacres have a way of attracting a great deal of attention. The day-to-day life of a people is rather dull. What is the historian to say about it? So the historian swoops down on a war or battle and makes the most of it. Of course we cannot forget or ignore such wars, but we must not attach more importance to them than they deserve. Let us think of the past in terms of the present, and of the people in those days in terms of ourselves. We shall then get a more human view of them, and we shall realize that what really counted were the day-to-day life and the thoughts of those people, and not the occasional wars. It is well to remember this, as you will find your history books over-full of such wars. Even these letters of mine are apt to stray in that direction. The real reason for this is the difficulty in writing about the day-to-day life of past times. I do not know enough about it.

The word “Ming” itself means bright. The Ming dynasty lasted for 276 years—from 1368 to 1644. It is the most typically Chinese of all dynasties, and during their rule the genius of the Chinese people had full scope. It is a period of peace, both domestic and foreign. There is no aggressive foreign policy;.

There is no aggressive foreign policy; no imperialist adventure. There is friendship with the neighbouring countries.

For the rest of the eastern world China is very much the elder brother, the clever, favoured and cultured one, very conscious of his superiority, but wishing well to the younger brothers and willing to teach them and share with them his own culture and civilization.

The Chinese Government was surprised at this barbarity. It took no hasty action, but ultimately it drove the whole lot of them out. The Portuguese then realized that their usual methods did not pay in China. They became more peaceful and humble, and in 1557 they obtained permission to settle down near Canton. Macao was then founded by them.

Christian missionaries were not encouraged by the Chinese.

There is a great beauty in China, but it is the calm beauty of the afternoon or evening.

And the more one thinks, the more one begins to examine existing conditions and to criticize them. And this often leads to a challenge of the existing order. Ignorance is always afraid of change. It fears the unknown and sticks to its rut, however miserable it may be there. In its blindness it stumbles on anyhow. But with right reading comes a measure of knowledge, and the eyes are partly opened.

If we were together it would be different, would it not? But why should I write then, if you and I could talk to each other?.

Thus the main result of the Reformation was to free the kings and princes from the leading-strings of the Pope.

A very able minister, the Cardinal Richelieu, helped in strengthening France and her monarchy. France has always thought that her strength and security lay in the weakness of Germany. So Richelieu, who was a great Catholic priest, and who crushed Protestants mercilessly in France, actually encouraged Protestants in Germany. This was intended to encourage mutual conflict and disorder in Germany, and thus to weaken her. This policy met with great success. There was, as we shall see, civil war of the worst kind in Germany, which ruined her.

Do you remember visiting Versailles, near Paris? Those great palaces there, that we go to see now, grew up in the seventeenth century out of the blood of the French peasantry. Versailles was the symbol of absolute and irresponsible monarchy; and it is not surprising that Versailles became the forerunner of the French Revolution, which put an end to all monarchy.

The country of Hindustan has few pleasures to recommend it. The people are not handsome. They have no idea of the charms of friendly society, or of frankly mixing together or of familiar intercourse. They have no genius, no comprehension of mind, no politeness of manner, no kindness or fellow feeling, no ingenuity or mechanical invention in planning or executing their handicraft works, no skill or knowledge in design or architecture; they have no good horses, no good flesh, no grapes or musk-melons, no good fruits, no ice or cold water, no good food, or bread in their bazaars, no baths or colleges, no candles, no torches, not a candlestick.

He had gone back at last to the flowers he longed for.

It is a strange thing that a Buddhist Emperor of India of the third century before Christ, and a Muslim Emperor of India of the sixteenth century after Christ, should speak in the same manner and almost in the same voice. One wonders if this is not perhaps the voice of India herself speaking through two of her great sons.

Thus we see in this Prince the common fault of the atheist, who refuses to make reason subservient to faith, and, accepting nothing as true which his feeble mind is unable to fathom, is content to submit to his own imperfect judgment matters transcending the highest limits of human understanding. If this is the definition of an atheist, the more we have of them the better.

He lies buried in a beautiful mausoleum at Sikandra, near Agra.

Indeed he was a great king; for he knew that the good ruler is he who can command, simultaneously, the obedience, the respect, the love and the fear of his subjects. He was a prince beloved of all, firm with the great, kind to those of low estate, and just to all men, high and low, neighbour or stranger, Christian, Saracen or Gentile; so that every man believed that the king was on his.

“More tears have been shed than the waters that are in the great ocean,”.

Sorrow and tears are poor companions in this world. “More tears have been shed than the waters that are in the great ocean,” said the Buddha, and many more tears will be shed before this unhappy world is put right.

The Chinese language, you will remember, consists of characters, not words. Kang Hi had a lexicon or dictionary of the language prepared. This was a mighty work containing over 40,000 characters, with numerous phrases illustrating them. It is said to be unrivalled even today.

Chien Lung extended his empire by conquering Turkestan in Central Asia and occupying Tibet. Some years later, in 1790, the Gurkhas of Nepal invaded Tibet. Chien Lung thereupon not only drove out the Gurkhas from Tibet, but pursued them over the Himalayas into Nepal, and compelled Nepal to become a vassal State of the Chinese Empire. This conquest of Nepal was a remarkable achievement. For a Chinese army to cross Tibet and then the Himalayas and beat a warlike people like the Gurkhas in their very homeland, is amazing. As it happened, the British in India had trouble with Nepal only twenty-two years later, in 1814. They sent an army to Nepal, but this met with great.

Beethoven, perhaps the greatest musical composer of the West, became, strange to say, quite deaf, and so the wonderful music he created for others he could not hear himself. But his heart must have sung to him before he captured that music.

There are only two powers in the world: the spirit and the sword. In the long run the sword will always be conquered by the spirit.”.

Reasoning was not encouraged, and people were asked to believe in what they were told, and were not to question why.

Wars are not pleasant subjects, and far too much importance is paid to them in history.

A great deal of credit is taken by the British for the abolition of what is (rather incorrectly) called sati, the practice of a Hindu widow burning herself on the funeral pyre of her husband. They deserve some credit for this, but as a matter of fact the government only took action after many years of agitation by Indian reformers headed by Raja Ram Mohan Roy. Previous to them other rulers, and especially the Marathas, had forbidden it; the Portuguese Albuquerque had abolished the practice in Goa. It was put down by the British as a result of Indian agitation and Christian missionary endeavours. So far as I can remember, this was the only reform of religious significance which was brought about by the British Government.

Later in the century another religious reform movement took place. This was in the Punjab, and the founder was Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Another society was started, called the Arya Samaj. This also rejected many of the later growths of Hinduism and combated caste. Its cry was “Back to the Vedas”. Although it was a reforming movement, influenced no doubt by Muslim and Christian thought, it was in essence an aggressive militant movement. And so it happened, curiously, that the Arya Samaj which, of many Hindu sects, probably came nearest to Islam, became a rival and opponent of Islam. It was an attempt to convert the defensive and static Hinduism into an aggressive missionary religion. It was meant to revive Hinduism. What gave the movement some strength was a colouring of nationalism. It was, indeed, Hindu nationalism raising its head. And the very fact that it was Hindu nationalism made it difficult for it to become Indian nationalism.

There seems to be a strange contrast between the behaviour of individuals to each other and the behaviour of nations. Children and boys and girls are taught not to be too selfish, to think of others, to behave properly. All our education is meant to teach us this lesson, and to a small extent we learn it. And then comes war, and we forget our old lesson, and the brute in us shows his face. So decent people behave like brutes.

They had kept away not because they were more virtuous than the others, but because they were busy developing their vast country.

It is kismet, it is fate, it is the punishment for past sins. Society is always conservative, and dislikes change. It loves to remain in the rut it has got into, and firmly believes that it was meant to remain there.

For art and literature often give greater insight into a nation’s soul than the superficial activities of the multitude.

For art and literature often give greater insight into a nation’s soul than the superficial activities of the multitude. They take us to a region of calm and serene thought which is not affected by the passions and prejudices of the moment. But today the poet and the artist are seldom looked upon as the prophets of tomorrow and they meet with little honour. If some honour comes to them at all, it usually comes after they are dead.

Socialism, I have told you, is of many kinds. There is general agreement, however, that it aims at the control by the State of the means of production—that is, land and mines and factories and the like—and the means of distribution, like railways, etc., and also banks and similar institutions. The idea is that individuals should not be allowed to exploit any of these methods or institutions, or the labour of others, to their own personal advantage. Today most of these are privately owned and exploited, with the result that some people prosper and grow rich, while society as a whole suffers greatly and the masses remain poor. Also a great deal of the energy of even the owners and controllers of these means of production goes at present in fighting each other in cut-throat competition. If instead of this private war there was a sensible arranging of production and a well thought-out distribution, waste and useless competition would be avoided, and the present great inequalities in wealth between different classes and peoples would disappear. Therefore production, and distribution and other important activities should be largely socialized or controlled by the State—that is, by the people as a whole. That is the basic idea of socialism.

The fault always lies with the system, not with individuals.

Marx constantly talks of exploitation and class struggles. Many of us become angry and excited at the injustice which we see around us. But, according to Marx, this is not a matter for anger or good virtuous advice. The exploitation is not the fault of the person exploiting. The dominance of one class over another has been the natural result of historical progress, and in due time gives place to another arrangement. If a person belonged to the dominant class, and as such exploited others, this was not a terrible sin for him. He was a part of a system, and it was absurd to call him unkind names. We are much too apt to forget this distinction between individuals and systems. India is under British imperialism, and we fight this imperialism with all our might. But the Englishmen who happen to support this system in India are not to blame. They are just little cogs in a huge machine, powerless to make any difference to its movement. In the same way, some of us may consider the zamindari system out of date and most harmful to the tenantry which is exploited terribly under it. But that again does not mean that the individual zamindar is to blame; so also the capitalists who are often blamed as exploiters. The fault always lies with the system, not with individuals.

But Russia, huge as it was, had then no outlet on the sea except in the Arctic Ocean, which was not much good. So he pushed north-west to the Baltic and south to the Crimea. He did not reach the Crimea (his successors did that), but he got to the Baltic after defeating Sweden. He founded a new westernized city, called St. Petersburg, on the Neva, off the Gulf of Finland, which led to the Baltic Sea. He made this his capital, and so tried to break with the old traditions which clung to Moscow. Peter died in 1725.

More than half a century later, in 1782, another Russian ruler tried to “westernize” the country. This was a woman, Catherine II, also called the Great. She was an extraordinary woman, strong, cruel, able, and with a very unsavoury reputation about her personal life. Having disposed of her husband, the Tsar, by murder, she became the Autocrat of all the Russias and ruled for fourteen years. She posed as a great patron of culture and tried to make friends with Voltaire, with whom she corresponded.

Then there is perhaps the greatest of them, Leo Tolstoy, who not only was a genius at writing novels, but became a religious and spiritual leader whose influence was far-reaching. Indeed, it reached Gandhiji, who was then in South Africa, and the two appreciated each other and corresponded with each other. The bond of union was the firm faith of both in non-resistance or non-violence. According to Tolstoy, this was the basic teaching of Christ, and Gandhiji drew the same conclusion from the old Hindu writings. While Tolstoy remained a prophet, living up to his convictions, but rather cut off from the world, Gandhiji applied this seemingly negative thing in an active way to mass problems in South Africa and India.

“No nation can be free when half the population is enslaved in the kitchen.”.

War, and see how the victors behaved. Germany was prostrate.

In order to give Poland access to the sea, quite an extraordinary feat was accomplished.

It is worth noting, however, that even in theory the League did not try to end war; it sought to put difficulties in its way, so that the passage of time and efforts at conciliation might soothe away war passions. Nor did it try to remove the causes of war.

The most remarkable rebirth of a nation that seemed to be down and out is that of Turkey, and for that the credit must go in a large measure to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the gallant leader who refused to submit even when all seemed against him. Not only did he win freedom for his country, but he modernized it and changed it out of all recognition. He put an end to the Sultanate and the Caliphate, and the seclusion of women and a host of other old customs. The moral and actual support of the Soviet was of great help to him. The Soviet also was of help to Persia in her efforts to get rid of British influence. A strong man, Riza Khan, rose there also, and he is the ruler now. Afghanistan also succeeded during this period in establishing its complete independence.

Children were also encouraged in various ways to develop themselves fully as self-reliant and capable citizens, instead of the old learn-by-heart type of the religious schools. One remarkable institution was the “Children’s Week”. For one week in each year, it is said, each government official was nominally replaced by a child and the whole State was administered by children. I do not know how this works, but it is a fascinating idea, and I am sure that, however silly and inexperienced some of the children may be, they cannot behave in a more foolish way than many of our grown-up and staid and solemn-looking rulers and officials do.

A group or a community is always selfish, just as a nation is selfish, although individuals in the community or nation may take an unselfish view. So each group wanted far more than its share and, inevitably, there was conflict. As inter-communal bitterness increased, the more extreme communal leaders of each group came to the front, for, in moments of anger, each group chooses as its representative the person who pitches his group demands highest and curses the others most.

Bourgeoisie,.

In a country which has several distinct national groups, nationalism is often a disruptive force which, instead of strengthening and binding together the country, actually weakens it and tends to break it up. The Austro-Hungarian Empire before the World War was such a country with many nationalities, of which two, the German-Austrians and the Hungarians, were the dominant ones, and the others were dependent. The growth of nationalism therefore weakened Austria-Hungary, as it infused fresh life into each of these nationalities separately, and with this came the desire for freedom. The war made matters worse, and the country broke up into little bits when defeat followed the war, each national area forming a separate State. (The division was not a very happy or logical one, but we need not go into that here.) Germany, on the other hand, in spite of a severe defeat, did not break up into bits. It held together even in disaster under the powerful stress of nationalism.

These Jews were finally dispersed all over the world. They had no home or nation, and everywhere they went they were treated as unwelcome and undesirable strangers. They were made to live in special areas of cities, apart from the others—“ghettos” these areas were called— so that they might not pollute others. Sometimes they were made to put on a special dress. They were humiliated, reviled, tortured, and massacred; the very word “Jew” became a word of abuse, a synonym for a miser and a grasping money-lender. And yet these amazing people not only survived all this, but managed to keep their racial and cultural characteristics, and prospered and produced a host of great men. Today they hold leading positions as scientists, statesmen, literary men, financiers, businessmen, and even the greatest socialists and communists have been Jews.

The Soviets’ difficulties appear to have been far greater than ours, for they had 182 different nationalities to deal with. Their solution of the problem has been very successful. They went to the extreme length of recognizing each separate nationality and encouraging it to carry on its work and education in its own language. This was not merely to please the separatist tendencies of different minorities, but because it was felt that real education and cultural progress could take effect for the masses only if the native tongue were used. And the results achieved already have been remarkable.

It is well, therefore, for us to realize that the great increase in knowledge in the world does not necessarily make us better or wiser.

They live in an age of science, but the ideas that govern them and their actions belong to ages long past. It is natural that difficulties and conflicts should arise.

Democracy, if it means anything, means equality; not merely the equality of possessing a vote, but economic and social equality. Capitalism means the very opposite: a few people holding economic power and using this to their own advantage.

Feudalism, capitalism, socialism, syndicalism, anarchism, communism— so many isms! And behind them all stalks opportunism!.

# Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five (Curtis Smith)

“What if a demon were to creep after you one night, in your loneliest loneliness, and say, ‘This life which you live must be lived by you once again and innumerable times more; and every pain and joy and thought and sigh must come again to you, all in the same sequence. The eternal hourglass will again and again be turned and you with it, dust of the dust!’ Would you throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse that demon? Or would you answer, ‘Never have I heard anything more divine’?”.


# Slaughterhouse-Five (Kurt Vonnegut)

I said that to Harrison Starr, the movie-maker, one time, and he raised his eyebrows and inquired, “Is it an anti-war book?” “Yes,” I said. “I guess.” “You know what I say to people when I hear they’re writing anti-war books?” “No. What do you say, Harrison Starr?” “I say, ‘Why don’t you write an anti-glacier book instead?’” What he meant, of course, was that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers. I believe that, too. And even if wars didn’t keep coming like glaciers, there would still be plain old death.

Another thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my father died, he said to me, “You know—you never wrote a story with a villain in it.” I told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.

It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. And what do the birds say? All there is to say about a massacre, things like “Poo-tee-weet?”.

GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE, COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN, AND WISDOM ALWAYS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

There were two peepholes inside the airlock—with yellow eyes pressed to them. There was a speaker on the wall. The Tralfamadorians had no voice boxes. They communicated telepathically. They were able to talk to Billy by means of a computer and a sort of electric organ which made every Earthling speech sound. “Welcome aboard, Mr. Pilgrim,” said the loudspeaker. “Any questions?” Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: “Why me?” “That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?” “Yes.” Billy, in fact, had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it. “Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”.

“How—how did I get here?” “It would take another Earthling to explain it to you. Earthlings are the great explainers, explaining why this event is structured as it is, telling how other events may be achieved or avoided. I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I’ve said before, bugs in amber.”.

“If I hadn’t spent so much time studying Earthlings,” said the Tralfamadorian, “I wouldn’t have any idea what was meant by ‘free will.’ I’ve visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.”.

There isn’t any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.”.

“How nice—to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive.”.

There wasn’t a real doctor in the compound, so the doctoring was up to him. “How’s the patient?” he asked Derby. “Dead to the world.” “But not actually dead.” “No.” “How nice—to feel nothing, and still get full credit for being alive.” Derby now came to lugubrious attention.

“That’s one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.”.

“Anybody ever asks you what the sweetest thing in life is—” said Lazzaro, “it’s revenge.”.

# Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War (Max Hastings)

In our own twenty-first century, the popular vision of the war is dominated by images of trenches, mud, wire and poets.

This part of the story is inevitably that of the statesmen and generals who willed it, of the rival manoeuvres of the Triple Alliance – Germany and Austria-Hungary with Italy as a non-playing member – against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain.

In today’s Britain, there is a widespread belief that the war was so horrendous that the merits of the rival belligerents’ causes scarcely matter – the Blackadder take on history, if you like.

‘My dear Winston, the experiences of a long life have convinced me that nothing ever happens.’.

In Germany, chief of staff Helmuth von Moltke inherited in 1906 from his predecessor, Alfred Graf von Schlieffen,.

Participants in all conflicts with more than two belligerents have different motivations for deciding to fight,.

Participants in all conflicts with more than two belligerents have different motivations for deciding to fight, and this was emphatically true in 1914.

‘Every nation will continue to arm for war until a day comes at which one or the other says: “Better a terrible end than a terror without end.” [A nation may also say]: “If we delay any longer, we shall be the weaker instead of the stronger.” Then the catastrophe will happen.

War is a biological necessity of the first importance … Without war, inferior or decaying races would easily choke the growth of healthy, budding elements, and a universal decadence would follow … Might gives the right to conquer or occupy.’.

Wells were among those expressing repugnance.


# Player Piano (Kurt Vonnegut)

Bud, who was manager of the petroleum terminal in Ilium, worked only when shipments came or went by barge or pipeline, and he spent most of his time between these crises—as now—filling Katharine’s ears with the euphoria of his Georgia sweet talk.

Five of the Shah’s expressions. “Khabu” meant “where?” “Siki” meant “what?” “Akka sahn” meant “why?” “Brahous brahouna, houna saki” was a combination of blessing and thanks, and Sumklish was the sacred Kolhouri drink which Khashdrahr carried in a hip flask for the Shah.

Each had before him a headless beer in a glass whose rim was opaqued by hours of slow, thoughtful sipping.

Paul envied Finnerty’s mind, for Finnerty could be anything he wanted to be, and be brilliant at it. Whatever the times might have called for, Finnerty would have been among the best. If this had been the age of music, Finnerty would have been, and in fact was, a top-flight pianist—or he might have been an architect or physician or writer. With inhuman intuition, Finnerty could sense the basic principles and motives of almost any human work, not just engineering.

Paul could have been only what he was, he thought. As he filled his glass again, he supposed that he could only have come to this moment, this living room, into the presence of Anita.

Khashdrahr shrugged and looked questioningly at Halyard. “Shah says, if these not slaves, how you get them to do what they do?” “Patriotism,” said General of the Armies Bromley sternly. “Patriotism, damn it.” “Love of country,” said Halyard. Khashdrahr told the Shah, and the Shah nodded slightly, but his look of puzzlement did not disappear. “Sidi ba—” he said tentatively.

Eternal vigilance was the price of efficiency.

“A psychiatrist could help. There’s a good man in Albany.” Finnerty shook his head. “He’d pull me back into the center, and I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can’t see from the center.”.

“Big, undreamed-of things—the people on the edge see them first.”.

He used words to describe his feelings that Paul could never bring himself to use when speaking of a friend: love, affection, and other words generally consigned to young and inexperienced lovers. It wasn’t homosexual; it was an archaic expression of friendship by an undisciplined man in an age when most men seemed in mortal fear of being mistaken for pansies for even a split second.

“But you find out quick enough that old friends are old friends, and nothing more—no wiser, no more help than anyone else. Well, what the hell, that doesn’t mean I’m not damned pleased to see you again.”.

“One more thing: I want to be sure you understand that men really do worry about what there is for their sons to live for; and some sons do hang themselves.”.

“Sometimes I think I’d like to be—if only in self-defense. Also, it’d be a swell way to get rich. Trouble is, I can be sold or unsold on anything too easily. I enjoy being talked into something. Pretty shaky outlook for a Messiah. Besides, who ever heard of a short, fat, middle-aged Messiah with bad eyesight? And I haven’t got that common touch. Frankly, the masses give me a pain in the tail, and I guess I show it.” He made clucking sounds with his tongue. “I’m going to get myself a uniform, so I’ll know what I think and stand for.”.

I do know that it’s far easier to ask questions than to answer them.

“What else could we possibly give the people that they haven’t got?” “There! You made my point for me. You said, what else could we give them, as though everything in the world were ours to give or withhold.”.

Could be softened with a smile, but not saboteur.

“Fare thee well, for I must leave you, Please don’t let this parting grieve you; Fare thee well, the time has come for us to say goodbye. Adieu, adieu, kind friends, adieu, yes, adieu!.

And my husband says somebody’s just got to be maladjusted; that somebody’s got to be uncomfortable enough to wonder where people are, where they’re going, and why they’re going there. That was the trouble with his book. It raised those questions, and was rejected. So he was ordered into public-relations duty.”.

“For richer, for poorer, in sickness as in health,” said Paul. “Remember that Anita? Do you remember?” “You’re still rich, and you’re not sick.” She looked at him with passing concern. “You’re not sick, are you?” “At heart.” “You’ll get used to it. I did.” “I’m sorry, Anita—I didn’t know it had been that bad. I see now that it probably was.”.

“Jimmy, I.Q. isn’t everything. Some of the unhappiest people in this world are the smartest ones.”.

“Everybody works at something. Getting out of bed’s work! Getting food off your plate and into your mouth’s work! But there’s two kinds of work, kid, work and hard work. If you want to stand out, have something to sell, you got to do hard work. Pick out something impossible and do it, or be a bum the rest of your life. Sure, everybody worked in George Washington’s time, but George Washington worked hard. Everybody worked in Shakespeare’s time, but Shakespeare worked hard. I’m who I am because I work hard.”.

Replacement is not necessarily bad, but to do it without regard for the wishes of men is lawlessness.

“Men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful. They must, therefore, be returned to participation in such enterprises. “I hold, and the members of the Ghost Shirt Society hold: “That there must be virtue in imperfection, for Man is imperfect, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in frailty, for Man is frail, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in inefficiency, for Man is inefficient, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in brilliance followed by stupidity, for Man is alternately brilliant and stupid, and Man is a creation of God. “You perhaps disagree with the antique and vain notion of Man’s being a creation of God. “But I find it a far more defensible belief than the one implicit in intemperate faith in lawless technological progress—namely, that man is on earth to create more durable and efficient images of himself, and, hence, to eliminate any justification at all for his own continued existence. “Faithfully yours, “Doctor Paul Proteus.”.

“Every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity,”.

“And read books instead of watching television,”.


# River Out Of Eden: A Darwinian View Of Life (Richard Dawkins)

All organisms that have ever lived-every animal and plant, all bacteria and all fungi, every creeping thing, and all readers of this book-can look back at their ancestors and make the following proud claim: Not a single one of our ancestors died in infancy. They all reached adulthood, and every single one was capable of finding at least one heterosexual partner and of successfully copulating.'.

The river of pure digital information. majestically flowing through geological time and splitting into three billion branches, is a powerful image.

It is often thought clever to say that science is no more than our modern origin myth. The Jews had their Adam and Eve, the Sumerians their Marduk and Gilgamesh, the Greeks Zeus and the Olympians, the Norsemen their Valhalla. What is evolution, some smart people say, but our modern equivalent of gods and epic heroes, neither better nor worse, neither truer nor falser? There is a fashionable salon philosophy called cultural relativism which holds, in its extreme form, that science has no more claim to truth than tribal myth: science is just the mythology favored by our modern Western tribe.

Those creationists who recognize that Darwinian evolution provides at least some sort of alternative to their scriptural theory often resort to a slightly more sophisticated objection.

Human males are roused to lust by pictures in a magazine. A picture is just printing ink on paper. It is two-dimensional, not three. The image is only a few inches high. It may be a crude caricature consisting of a few lines, rather than a lifelike representation. Yet it can still arouse a man to erection.

We cannot admit that things might be neither good nor evil, neither cruel nor kind, but simply callous-indifferent to all suffering, lacking all purpose.

We humans have purpose on the brain. We find it hard to look at anything without wondering what it is "for," what the motive for it is, or the purpose behind it. When the obsession. with purpose becomes pathological it is called paranoiareading malevolent purpose into what is actually random bad luck. But this is just an exaggerated form of a nearly universal delusion. Show us almost any object or process, and it is hard for us to resist the "Why" question-the "What is it for?" question.

"You scientists are very good at answering 'How' questions. But you must admit you're powerless when it comes to 'Why' questions.".

If you were trying to maximize the number of your grandchildren, should you have a son or a daughter? We have already seen that you should have a child of whichever sex is in the minority in the population.

On the face of it, it might look as though God's Utility Function is sometimes drawn up along the lines of the (now thankfully unfashionable) Miss World contest, but with males parading the runway.

Nature's Utility Function never values longevity for its own sake but only for the sake of future reproduction.

During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease. It must be so. If there is ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.


# Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist (Kate Raworth)

The most powerful tool in economics is not money, nor even algebra. It is a pencil. Because with a pencil you can redraw the world.

‘You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.’.

Economics is the mother tongue of public policy, the language of public life, and the mindset that shapes society.

# Renewable energy in India - Wikipedia (wikipedia.org)

Wind power capacity was 34,046 MW as of 31 March 2018, making India the fourth-largest wind power producer in the world.

Note that the well at the block boundary withdraws only half of its fluid production potential from gridblock 4, as shown in Figure 7-6b (i.e. , F4 = ~ , Configuration 2 in Chapter 6). In other words, the whole well has twice the drainage area of the well in wellblock 4; i.e. , Ax = 600 ft not 300 ft, and the geometric factor of wellblock 4 is half of that for the whole well.Therefore, Teq4 = 0.14[(600)2 + (350)2 ]0.5 = 97.247 ft, * = 2Jr x 0.001127 x 270 x 40 - 10.463 RB-cp/D-G,. log e[97.247/(3.5 / 12)] + 1.5 psi, G,,4 = ~ GS,4 = ]/2 (| 0.463) = 5.2315 RB-cp/D-psi, and 5.2315 qsc4 - l x 0 . ~ ( p 4 - 3 8 5 0 )or.


# The Future Is Asian (Parag Khanna)

Asia contains half of the world’s largest countries by land area, including Russia, China, Australia, India, and Kazakhstan.

When nations graduate from common geography into meaningful interactions, a system is born.

“It is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the security of Asia.”.

Fundamentally, Asians seek not conquest but respect.

Fundamentally, Asians seek not conquest but respect. A sufficient degree of respect for one another’s interests is enough.

The biggest geopolitical phenomena of the past three decades have come in rapid succession: the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the consolidation of the European Union, the rise of China, the US shale energy revolution, and now the emergence of an Asian system.

The outsourcing of US jobs to Asia and the erosion of the country’s industrial base were among the most salient causes of working-class frustration that propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

These examples reflect how Asians view the United States: not as a hegemon but as a service provider. US weapons, capital, oil, and technology are utilities in a global marketplace. The United States is a vendor, and Asia has become its largest customer and competitor at the same time. There was a time when the United States was the default option for the provision of security, capital, and technology, but Asian countries are increasingly providing these services for one another. The United States is more dispensable than it thinks.

The “global financial crisis” was not global: Asian growth rates continued to surge, and almost all the world’s fastest-growing economies are in Asia.

China wants foreign resources and markets, not foreign colonies.

Asianization is emerging as the newest sedimentary layer in the geology of global civilization.

Asianization takes many forms but is universally palpable: selling commodities to China, recruiting software engineers from India, buying oil from Saudi Arabia, taking vacations in Japan or Indonesia, recruiting nurses from the Philippines, hosting construction crews from Korea, doing apprenticeships in the UAE, and other relationships. Asian businesspeople strut around the world as their passports gain more visa-free privileges.

Asianization is like an additional layer of paint on an already colorful canvas; it adds texture and hues.

At the same time, becoming more Asian does not necessarily mean becoming less American or European. Asianization is like an additional layer of paint on an already colorful canvas; it adds texture and hues.

“a hundred schools of thought” flourished. The military theorist Sun Tzu compiled his treatise The Art of War, which revealed strategies in espionage and battlefield tactics.

The princess of Ayodhya in India even married into Korean royalty.

Almost 100 percent of India’s goods trade transits through either the Suez Canal or the Strait of Malacca.

Pakistan also has one of Asia’s leading AI outsourcing companies, Afiniti, which has more than three thousand employees and a valuation of $2 billion.

At the same time, Indians are the fastest-growing number of illegal immigrants, whether by overstaying their visas or by trying to enter the United States via Mexico.

California has by far the largest number of Asians at nearly 7 million, followed by New York with 2 million.

Indians have the highest median household incomes, followed by Filipinos and Japanese, then Chinese, Pakistanis, and Koreans.

All of this ethnodemographic-diplomatic drama could be just the beginning given the high-level Canadian government discussions on how to increase the country’s population from the current 35 million to potentially 100 million by the end of the century.

Certainly, over the past two generations, millions of Asians have settled in the United States and become proud Asian Americans. Most of their children—whether American-born Chinese (ABC) or American-born confused desi (ABCD) for Indians—think of themselves simply as American—no ethnic prefix hyphenation needed—and will only ever have American passports.

The majority of Asians coming to the United States for education are therefore not new Asian anchors but rather opportunists, taking the best of American academic expertise and entrepreneurial culture back to their homelands, where they can be among extended family and make a greater difference to their national futures.

“Africans to solve African problems in an African way.”.

The rule of law is so strong in South Korea that the country impeached a sitting president and jailed him for more than two decades and is now implementing strict term limits.

Asians do not lack an interest in democracy or the ability to sustain it. But they do have a no-nonsense bias in favor of pragmatic government and are culturally cautious about becoming collectively undisciplined.

Pew Research Center surveys conducted worldwide suggest that people do not want democracy at the price of corruption and incompetence.

A prominent survey reveals that from World War II to today, the percentage of Americans who feel it is “essential to live in a democracy” has fallen from three-quarters to under one-third.

Everyday people don’t measure these things by how.

All societies want a balance of prosperity and livability, openness and protection, effective governance and citizen voice, individualism and cohesion, free choice and social welfare. Everyday people don’t measure these things by how democratic their country is but by whether they feel safe in their cities, can afford their homes, have stability in their work, have a plan for growing old, and can remain connected to friends and family.

But, as Plato foresaw, only an educated population can responsibly assume democratic rights.

Despite all of this inclusive dialogue, Singapore.

Despite all of this inclusive dialogue, Singapore does not overconsult. Deliberation never degenerates into paralysis.

Singapore’s civil service is second to none. It is run like a spiral staircase: with each rung a civil servant learns to manage a different portfolio, gaining firsthand experience and building a broad knowledge base. By contrast, US politics is like an elevator: one can get in on the bottom floor and go straight to the top, missing all the learning in between.

One successful antibody against corruption is having highly paid ministers whose visibility demands that they view government service as a trusteeship rather than as a pathway to later wealth.

Civil servants earn high salaries and also receive modest bonuses tied to national economic performance.

Singapore’s people are far more interested in tangible delivery outputs than in democratic inputs for their own sake.

China is the only country in the world in which about forty years of training are required before one is allowed to wield federal authority.

As one Chinese scholar remarked, “Chinese people don’t love their government, but they trust it.”.

Indonesian factory owners and landholders buy parliament seats to shape regulations to their benefit.

Failures may be forgiven, but they are never forgotten.

When governments enjoy trust, they can not only pursue long-term transformation but also act decisively in crisis, whether an economic downturn or a sudden geopolitical shock. Because such Asian leaders think in generational rather than electoral terms and lines of authority are clear, everyone knows exactly where the buck stops. Neither political nor corporate leaders can slip into anonymity and wash away their sins. Failures may be forgiven, but they are never forgotten.

China is at the forefront of using big data as a tool to encourage behavioral conformity.

China is at the forefront of using big data as a tool to encourage behavioral conformity. Drawing on data from Alibaba, Tencent, and other platforms, authorities use the new social credit system (SCS) to determine which citizens have committed dishonorable acts and issue penalties. Some have been denied loans, cannot buy airline or train tickets, have had their passports suspended, or temporarily lose their Internet access. Though seemingly Orwellian from the outside, many (if not most) Chinese want greater transparency into what the government monitors—and now, for better or worse, they know. Importantly, the social credit system also cracks down on restaurants that sell contaminated food and vendors selling counterfeit goods. Reputation has long been an important currency in Asian societies, and now it applies to everyone in the social and commercial marketplace.

When the United States was spending heavily on its global military presence and others were able to keep their budgets down, it was called a security umbrella. When China recycles its trade surpluses and reserves into low-cost infrastructure for dozens of countries, why don’t we call it a development platform? When the United States requires that all dollar transactions be cleared by US banks so the US Treasury can sanction financial flows, it is considered to be upholding the financial system. But when Alibaba provides a platform for millions of SMEs to seamlessly trade with one another worldwide, why is it not called a breakthrough in global peer-to-peer commerce?.

The vast diversity of Asian tongues from Arabic, Turkish, and Farsi to Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bahasa is a salient reminder that Asians will always struggle to speak with one voice.

The time of the Beatles’ late-1960s retreat to India to study Transcendental Meditation is widely considered to have been one of the band’s most productive periods.

# The Curious Charms of Arthur Pepper (Phaedra Patrick)

Although he hadn’t spoken to anyone for over a week, although all he had in the fridge was a small chunk of cheddar and an out-of-date bottle of milk, he still had his pride. He would not become one of Bernadette Patterson’s lost causes.

Cherry blossoms had already started to fall from the trees, swirling like pink confetti.

“Yes, that’s right. My name is Arthur Pepper. Miriam is my wife.” It felt wrong to say that Miriam was my wife, because although she was no longer here they were still married, weren’t they?.

In the grounds.” “There is a tiger charm.

“I think that bereaved people act in one of two ways. There are those who cling with their fingertips to the past, and those who brush their hands together and get on with their lives. That lady with the red hair is the latter. She keeps herself busy.”.

She said that if people are tired, lonely, heartbroken or have simply run out of steam, then they need food.

She said that if people are tired, lonely, heartbroken or have simply run out of steam, then they need food. I think it’s very courageous of her to make it her mission to help others.”.

But because this was a dream, he was able to rewind events in his head. This time when his wife stood before him inviting him to paddle, he said yes. Because he knew he might never have this moment again. Because he knew that his time with the kids was precious, and in the future Dan would live thousands of miles away and Lucy would be distant. He knew there would be so many times over the coming years that he would long to be on the beach with his family again.

There was nowhere he wanted to be more than here.

“Maybe you should just let the tortoise wander around for a while. It might quench his thirst for adventure. Then he might be happy to stay in his pen, or whatever his home is.”.

He felt as if someone had tied his intestines in a knot.

“When I was with her I didn’t want to be with anyone else. I never considered if she was the one because there was no one else. I liked the simplicity of life with her. We met when I was twenty-six and she was a year younger. We held hands, we walked, we kissed. All the time I thought of just her. I never looked at anyone else. We got engaged and then got married less than two years after we met. It was like I was following an invisible path that had already been laid out for me. There were other paths leading off it in different directions but I never wondered where.

For some reason, we have wise stomachs, and when The Decision isn’t obvious, sometimes asking your gut can do the trick.

And what makes your gut your gut is that when it answers that question, it doesn’t deliberate—it just knows the answer: a simple yes or a simple no.

‘philosophers do not practise what they preach’.

Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man’s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.

Be careful, however, that there is no element of discursiveness and desultoriness about this reading you refer to, this reading of many different authors and books of every description. You should be extending your stay among writers whose genius is unquestionable, deriving constant nourishment from them if you wish to gain anything from your reading that will find a lasting place in your mind. To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but no real friendships.

Food that is vomited up as soon as it is eaten is not assimilated into the body and does not do one any good; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment; a wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different ointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can be of any service in the mere passing. A multitude of books only gets in one’s way.

Theophrastus’ advice, judge a man after they have made him their friend instead of the other way round, certainly put the cart before the horse.

There are certain people who tell any person they meet things that should only be confided to friends, unburdening themselves of whatever is on their minds into any ear they please.

Avoid shabby attire, long hair, an unkempt beard, an outspoken dislike of silverware, sleeping on the ground and all other misguided means to self-advertisement.

Great pleasure is to be found not only in keeping up an old and established friendship but also in beginning and building up a new one. There is the same difference between having gained a friend and actually gaining a friend as there is between a farmer.

Great pleasure is to be found not only in keeping up an old and established friendship but also in beginning and building up a new one. There is the same difference between having gained a friend and actually gaining a friend as there is between a farmer harvesting and a farmer sowing.

The philosopher Attalus used to say that it was more of a pleasure to make a friend than to have one, ‘in the same way as an artist derives more pleasure from painting than from having completed a picture’.

‘for the purpose of having someone to come and sit beside his bed when he is ill or come to his rescue when he is hard up or thrown into chains’, but so that on the contrary he may have someone by whose sickbed he himself may sit or whom he may himself release when that person is held prisoner by hostile hands.

A person adopted as a friend for the sake of his usefulness will be cultivated only for so long as he is useful.

The ending inevitably matches the beginning: a person who starts being friends with you because it pays him will similarly cease to be friends because it pays him to do so. If there is anything in a particular friendship that attracts a man other than the friendship itself, the attraction of some reward or other will counterbalance that of the friendship.

‘Any man,’ he says, ‘who does not think that what he has is more than ample, is an unhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.’.

‘What about so-and-so,’ you may ask, ‘who became rich in such a despicable manner, or such-and-such a person who gives orders to a great many people but is at the mercy of a great many more? Supposing they say they are happy, will their own opinions to this effect make them happy?’ It does not make any difference what a man says; what matters is how he feels, and not how he feels on one particular day but how he feels at all times. But you have no need to fear that so valuable a thing may fall into unworthy hands. Only the wise man is content with what is his. All foolishness suffers the burden of dissatisfaction with itself.

After friendship is formed you must trust, but before that you must judge.


# Stoic Six Pack - Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Golden Sayings, Fragments and Discourses of Epictetus, Letters From A Stoic and The Enchiridion (Illustrated) (Aurelius, Marcus;Epictetus;Seneca)

The most disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness.

Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.

While we are postponing, life speeds by.

Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time.

We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.

The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.

You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. Food does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.


# Modern China (Rana Mitter)

Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, which looks over Tiananmen Square, is home to the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature and principal forum for Communist Party policy discussions.

Is from the main gate of the Forbidden City, once home to the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Confucianism is based on ideas of mutual obligation, maintenance of hierarchies, a belief in self-development, education, and improvement, and above all, an ordered society.

The ultimate ideal was to become sufficiently wise to attain the status of “sage” (sheng), but one should at least strive to become a junzi, often translated as “gentleman,” but perhaps best thought of as meaning “a person of integrity.”.

Nor was he the only thinker to shape early China: unlike Confucius and Mencius, who believed in the essential good nature of human beings, Xunzi believed that humans were essentially evil; and Han Feizi went further to argue that only a system of strict laws and harsh punishments, not ethical codes, could restrain people from doing wrong.


# China in Ten Words (Yu Hua)

This remorse left a profound mark, and it has stayed with me through all my years as an author. It is when the suffering of others becomes part of my own experience that I truly know what it is to live and what it is to write. Nothing in the world, perhaps, is so likely to forge a connection between people as pain, because the connection that comes from that source comes from deep in the heart. So when in this book I write of China’s pain, I am registering my pain too, because China’s pain is mine.

“We survive in adversity and perish in ease and comfort.”.

Man is bound to make mistakes, he believed, and it is in the unceasing correction of his errors that human progress lies.

Man is bound to make mistakes, he believed, and it is in the unceasing correction of his errors that human progress lies. Viewed in this light, he suggested, adversity has a way of enhancing our endurance, while ease and comfort tend to hasten our demise—whether as individuals or as a nation.

I had always assumed that light carries farther than human voices and voices carry farther than body heat. But that night I realized it is not so, for when the people stand as one, their voices carry farther than light and their heat is carried farther still. That, I discovered, is what “the people” means.

Hair length was the established yardstick for distinguishing the sexes, and so Marx and Engels left us baffled, especially Marx—his.

Hair length was the established yardstick for distinguishing the sexes, and so Marx and Engels left us baffled, especially Marx—his curly hair practically covered his ears, much like the women of our town, whose ears revealed themselves only occasionally beneath their thick heads of hair.

One girl in second grade had folded a portrait of Mao in such a way that a cross had appeared on his face; somebody informed on her, and we all called her “the little counterrevolutionary.” She broke down in tears at the school assembly where her crime was reported, and she blubbered so much when making her confession that we could hardly follow what she was saying.

The second reason was that China had the biggest population, and Chairman Mao had said the more the people, the greater their strength.

He wanted to become the leader of all exploited and oppressed peoples.

I used to have a photograph of myself when I was fifteen, standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square with Mao’s huge portrait visible in the background. It was taken not in Beijing but in the photography studio of our town a thousand miles away. The room in which I was standing cannot have been more than twenty feet wide, and the square was just a theatrical backdrop painted on the wall. When you looked at the photo, you might almost have believed I was really standing in Tiananmen Square—except for the complete absence of people in the acres of space behind me.

No one will grant us deliverance Neither god nor emperor To create happiness for man We depend on our own labor.

“Every time I read one of the great books, I feel myself transported to another place, and like a timid child I hug them close and mimic their steps, slowly tracing the long river of time in a journey where warmth and emotion fuse. They carry me off with them, then let me make my own way back, and it’s only on my return that I realize they will always be part of me.”.

If literature truly possesses a mysterious power, I think perhaps it is precisely this: that one can read a book by a writer of a different time, a different country, a different race, a different language, and a different culture and there encounter a sensation that is one’s very own. Heine put into words the feeling I had as a child when I lay napping in the morgue. And that, I tell myself, is literature.

Pankaj Mishra had been asked to write a piece about me for the New York Times Magazine and came to Beijing in November 2008. We spent hours talking together, sometimes in the warmth and comfort of indoors, sometimes venturing outside for a walk in the icy wind. When we ate out, I made a point of introducing him to different regional cuisines, and on his departure my new vegetarian friend complimented me on my skill in selecting dishes. “Well, it’s not much of a skill,” I told him. “I just order all the vegetarian dishes a restaurant has on its menu.”.

Was no psychology in my play—no soliloquies,.

We were fishers of memory, sitting on the banks of time and waiting for the past to swallow the bait.

Life is often this way: you may start off with an advantage, only to box yourself in over time, or sometimes you may start with a handicap, only to find it carries you a long way.

Or, as Mao put it, “Good things can become bad, and bad things can become good.” Perhaps Hemingway and I both fit that model of bad things becoming good.

At first writing actually felt the more arduous of the two activities. But in order to reach cultural-center nirvana, I forced myself to continue. I was young then, and it was no easy matter to persuade my bottom to maintain such constant intimacy with my chair.

But I sat stiffly at my desk, expending as much energy on getting words out on paper as a blacksmith does beating iron into shape on his anvil.

Years later young people often ask, “How does one become a writer?” My answer is always simply: “By writing.” Writing is like experience: if you don’t experience things, then you won’t understand life; and if you don’t write, then you won’t know.

“The more boldly a man dares, the more richly his land bears”.

“Better a socialist weed than a capitalist seedling,” we used to say in the Cultural Revolution. Today we can’t tell the difference between what is capitalist and what is socialist—weeds and seedlings come from one and the same plant.

In China there’s a saying, “People fear getting famous just as pigs fear getting fat,” reflecting the observation that fame invites a fall just as a fattened pig invites the butcher.

“Pigs that deserve to die will die, whether or not they make it onto the rich list.”.

Barefoot doctors were an invention of the Mao era: peasants with a smattering of education were shown how to perform routine medical procedures and then sent back home with a medical kit on their backs. Why were they called barefoot doctors? Because for them practicing medicine was just a sideline activity; their basic work remained going out to the fields and laboring in their bare feet.

Knew it wasn’t really correct to say I’d been a “barefoot doctor,” for though I couldn’t claim to have received much more training than those peasant doctors, I had at least been engaged in dentistry full-time. The problem was that for many years I couldn’t find the right word to describe my first job, and it’s only with the emergence of new vocabulary in China today that I can finally give Western reporters a more accurate picture of my situation. “I used to be a copycat dentist,” I tell them now.

“use four ounces to shift a thousand pounds”—its.

“The more boldly a man dares, the more richly his land bears”—that famous Great Leap Forward mantra—turns out to be an apt description of bamboozlement’s essential nature.

Average Chinese citizens have no ambition to be famous and powerful, nor do they dream of making their fortunes overnight; for them contentment brings happiness. So when they bamboozle the government, the leverage effect is that of four ounces lifting four pounds; as long as they enjoy a fair degree of success, they feel pleased with a job well done.


# The Diary of a Young Girl: Anne Frank (Anne Frank;Otto H. Frank)

He’s an absolute hypochondriac!.

I’ve learned one thing: you only really get to know a person after a fight.

I’ve learned one thing: you only really get to know a person after a fight. Only then can you judge their true character!.

Everyone thinks I’m showing off when I talk, ridicu lous when I’m silent, insolent when I answer, cunning when I have a good idea, lazy when I’m tired, selfish when I eat one bite more than I should, stupid, cowardly, calculating, etc., etc. All day long I hear nothing but what an exasperating child I am, and although I laugh it off and pretend not to mind, I do mind. I wish I could ask God to give me another personality,.

I wish I could ask God to give me another personality, one that doesn’t antagonize everyone.

Now continue with a typical day in the Annex.

Crying can bring relief, as long as you don’t cry alone.

Can you tell me why people go to such lengths to hide their real selves? Or why I always behave very differently when I’m in the company of others? Why do people have so little trust in one another? I know there must be a reason, but sometimes I think it’s horrible that you can’t ever confide in anyone, not even those closest to you.

Going underground or into hiding has become as routine as the proverbial pipe and slippers that used to await the man of the house after a long day at work. There are many resistance groups, such as Free Netherlands, that forge identity cards, provide financial support to those in hiding, organize hiding places and find work for young Christians who go underground. It’s amazing how much these generous and unselfish people do, risking their own lives to help and save others. The best example of this is our own helpers, who have managed to pull us through so far and will hopefully bring us safely to shore, because otherwise they’ll find themselves sharing the fate of those they’re trying to protect. Never have they uttered a single word about the burden we must be, never have they complained that we’re too much trouble. They come upstairs every day and talk to the men about business and politics, to the women about food and wartime difficulties and to the children about books and newspapers. They put on their most cheerful expressions, bring flowers and gifts for birthdays and holidays and are always ready to do what they can. That’s something we should never forget; while others display their heroism in battle or against the Germans, our helpers prove theirs every day by their good spirits and affection. The most bizarre stories are making the rounds, yet most of them are really true. For instance, Mr. Kleiman reported this week that a soccer match was held in the province of Gelderland; one team consisted entirely of men who had gone underground, and the other of eleven Military Policemen. In Hilversum, new registration cards were issued. In order for the many people in hiding to get their rations (you have to show this card to obtain your ration book or else pay 60 guilders a book), the registrar asked all those hiding in that district to pick up their cards at a specified hour, when the documents could be collected at a separate table.

I firmly believe that nature can bring comfort to all who suffer.

Love, what is love? I don’t think you can really put it into words. Love is understanding someone, caring for him, sharing his joys and sorrows. This eventually includes physical love. You’ve shared something, given something away and received something in return, whether or not you’re married, whether or not you have a baby. Losing your virtue doesn’t matter, as long as you know that for as long as you live you’ll have someone at your side who understands you, and who doesn’t have to be shared with anyone else!.

Her advice in the face of melancholy is: “Think about all the suffering in the world and be thankful you’re not part of it.” My advice is: “Go outside, to the country, enjoy the sun and all nature has to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the happiness within yourself; think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy.”.

Go outside and try to recapture the happiness within yourself; think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy.” I don’t think Mother’s advice can be right, because what are you supposed to do if you become part of the suffering? You’d be completely lost. On the contrary, beauty remains, even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance. A person who’s happy will make others happy; a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery!.

This is where Mother and I differ greatly.

No one must know that my heart and mind are constantly at war with each other.

Have to maintain my air of confidence. No one must know that my heart and mind are constantly at war with each other. Up to now reason has always won the battle, but will my emotions get the upper hand? Sometimes I fear they will, but more often I actually hope they do!.

We’ve been strongly reminded of the fact that we’re Jews in chains, chained to one spot, without any rights, but with a thousand obligations. We must put our feelings aside; we must be brave and strong, bear discomfort with- out complaint, do whatever is in our power and trust in God. One day this terrible war will be over. The time will come when we’ll be people again and not just Jews!.

As you can no doubt imagine, we often say in despair, “What’s the point of the war? Why, oh, why can’t people live together peacefully? Why all this destruction?” The question is understandable, but up to now no one has come up with a satisfactory answer. Why is England manufacturing bigger and better airplanes and bombs and at the same time churning out new houses for reconstruction? Why are millions spent on the war each day, while not a penny is available for medical science, artists or the poor? Why do people have to starve when mountains of food are rotting away in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people so crazy? I don’t believe the war is simply the work of politicians and capitalists. Oh no, the common man is every bit as guilty; otherwise, people and nations would have re- belled long ago! There’s a destructive urge in people, the urge to rage, murder and kill. And until all of humanity, without exception, undergoes a metamorphosis, wars will continue to be waged, and everything that has been carefully built up, cultivated and grown will be cut down and destroyed, only to start allover again!.

To be honest, I can’t imagine how anyone could say “I’m weak” and then stay that way. If you know that about yourself, why not fight it, why not develop your character? Their answer has always been: “Because it’s much easier not to!” This reply leaves me feeling rather discouraged. Easy? Does that mean a life of deceit and laziness is easy too? Oh no, that can’t be true. It can’t be true that people are so readily tempted by ease. . . and money. I’ve given a lot of thought to what my answer should be, to how I should get Peter to believe in himself and, most of all, to change himself for the better. I don’t know whether I’m on the right track.


# A. A. Milne (Winnie-the-Pooh 02, Winnie the Pooh)

First of all he said to himself: That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee. Then he thought another long time, and said: 'And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.' And then he got up, and said: 'And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.' So he began to climb the tree.

'I do remember, and then when I try to remember, I forget.'.

'If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit,' he said, 'and Rabbit means Company,' he said, 'and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such like.

'The fact is,' said Rabbit, 'you're stuck.' 'It all comes,' said Pooh crossly, 'of not having front doors big enough.' 'It all comes,' said Rabbit sternly, 'of eating too much.

'There's a South Pole,' said Christopher Robin, 'and I expect there's an East Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them.'.

# Think and Grow Rich (Optimized for Kindle) (Hill, Napoleon;$1 Books)

Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind, but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated only in terms of lasting friendships, harmonious family relationships, sympathy and understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony which brings one peace of mind measurable.

I had learned, from years of experience with men, that when a man really DESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win.

That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity.

One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat.

He had never heard that more gold has been mined from the brains of men than has ever been taken from the earth.

A great many years ago I purchased a fine dictionary. The first thing I did with it was to turn to the word "impossible," and neatly clip it out of the book. That would not be an unwise thing for you to do.

EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT SUCCESS.

There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief.

"I bargined for Life for a penny, And Life would pay no more, However I bedded at evening When I counted my scanty store." "For Life is just an employer, He gives you just what you ask, But once you have set the wages, Why, must you bear the task." "I worked for a menial's hire, only to learn, dismayed, That any wage I asked of Life, Life would have willingly paid.".

"Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds.".

This is the equivalent of saying that any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.

The emotions of Faith, Love, and Sex, when mixed with any thought impulse, give it greater action than any of these emotions can do singly.

FAITH is the "eternal elixir" which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought!.

FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE!.

Taking inventory of mental assets and liabilities, you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence.

If you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto— suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent.

KNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of accumulation of money.

KNOWLEDGE will not attract money, unless it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical PLANS OF ACTION, to the DEFINITE END of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the source of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that "knowledge is power." It is nothing of the sort! Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes power only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end.

They have learned, from experience, that any person who has the ambition to give up a part of his spare time to studying at home has in him those qualities which make for leadership.

It is also one of the major reasons why EMPLOYERS GIVE GREATER CONSIDERATION TO EMPLOYEES WHO TAKE HOME STUDY COURSES. They have learned, from experience, that any person who has the ambition to give up a part of his spare time to studying at home has in him those qualities which make for leadership.

I am also trying to emphasize another point, namely, that both success and failure are largely the results of HABIT!.

When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give up before your goal has been reached, you are a "quitter.".

The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.

The world does not pay men for that which they "know." It pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.

The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.

The competent leader requires no "title" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The doors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostentation.

The "jack-of-all-trades" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on one DEFINITE CHIEF AIM.

Money in the bank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bar-gaining for the sale of personal services.

"Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking, much less in that of transmuting YOUR OWN DESIRE into money.

If you are influenced by the opinions of others, you will have no DESIRE of your own.

Take no one into your confidence, EXCEPT the members of your "Master Mind" group, and be very sure in your selection of this group, that you choose ONLY those who will be in COMPLETE SYMPATHY AND HARMONY WITH YOUR PURPOSE.

You have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own decisions. If you need facts or information from other people, to enable you to reach decisions, as you probably will in many instances; acquire these facts or secure the information you need quietly, without disclosing your purpose.

If you talk more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they envy you.

Keep your eyes and ears wide open— and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the habit of prompt DECISION. Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they envy you.

Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through modesty and silence.

Remember, also, that every time you open your mouth in the presence of a person who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your exact stock of knowledge, or your LACK of it! Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through modesty and silence.

Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it.

Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating force maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other profession or calling, including, of course, the accumulation of riches.

The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to the influence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire. Napoleon Bonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his first wife, Josephine, he was irresistible and invincible. When his "better judgment" or reasoning faculty prompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to decline. His defeat and St. Helena were not far distant.

I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so before the age of forty, and more often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of fifty. This fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause most carefully, carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve years.

One of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his attractive secretary was responsible for most of the plans he created.

Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. It is this inherent desire of man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man.

Men may be "giants" with indomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily managed by the women of their choice.

Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their choice— their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters— but they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the influence because they are intelligent enough to know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN.

Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their choice— their wives, sweethearts, mothers or sisters— but they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the influence because they are intelligent enough to know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN. The man who does not recognize this important truth deprives himself of the power which has done more to help men achieve success than all other forces combined.

You will also understand why you have been repeatedly admonished to MAKE YOUR DESIRES CLEAR, AND TO REDUCE THEM TO WRITING. You will also understand the necessity of PERSISTENCE in carrying out instructions.

INDECISION is the seedling of FEAR! Remember this, as you read. Indecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR!.

Before we can master an enemy, we must know its name, its habits, and its place of abode.

Needless to say, the proportion of the risk and its impact will depend on the quantity of shares you hold. Nonetheless, whether you like it or not, when you buy shares you also buy risk. So when the company goes public, the promoter is actually spreading his risk amongst a large group of people.

The stocks price tends to go up when the news is good or expected to be good.

For instance the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Indian Prime Minister was perceived as positive news and therefore the whole stock market moved.

In some cases there would be no news but still the price could move due to the demand and supply situation.

If you realize the first leg of the trade was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting – you first sell at a price you perceive as high with an intention of buying it back at a lower price at a later point in time. You have actually executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.

You can apply TA on any asset class as long as the asset type has historical time series data. Time series data in technical analysis context is information pertaining to the price variables namely – open high, low, close, volume etc.

For example in up trending markets, market participants get greedy and want to buy irrespective of the high price. Likewise in a down trend, market participants want to sell irrespective of the low and unattractive prices. This human reaction ensures that the price history repeats itself.


# The Lean Startup: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses (Eric Ries)

Brilliant college kids sitting in a dorm are inventing the future.

The business and marketing functions of a startup should be considered as important as engineering and product development and therefore deserve an equally rigorous methodology to guide them.

Anyone who is creating a new product or business under conditions of extreme uncertainty is an entrepreneur whether he or she knows it or not and whether working in a government agency, a venture-backed company, a nonprofit, or a decidedly for-profit company with financial investors.

The word institution connotes bureaucracy, process, even lethargy. How can that be part of a startup? Yet successful startups are full of activities associated with building an institution: hiring creative employees, coordinating their activities, and creating a company culture that delivers results.

In fact, I believe a company’s only sustainable path to long-term economic growth is to build an “innovation factory” that uses Lean Startup techniques to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis.

The irony is that it is often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a small amount. Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize. Everyone knows (or thinks he or she knows) stories of products that achieved breakthrough success overnight. As long as nothing has been released and no data have been collected, it is still possible to imagine overnight success in the future. Small numbers pour cold water on that hope.

Getting to Plan B.

Challenges that give a startup hope of surviving.10 If a competitor can outexecute a startup once the idea is known, the startup is doomed anyway. The reason to build a new team to pursue an idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that’s true, it.

If a competitor can outexecute a startup once the idea is known, the startup is doomed anyway. The reason to build a new team to pursue an idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that’s true, it makes no difference what the competition knows. If it’s not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy won’t fix them. Sooner or later, a successful startup will face competition from fast followers. A head start is rarely large enough to matter, and time spent in stealth mode—away from customers—is unlikely to provide a head start. The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.

3D printing and rapid prototyping tools. As just one example, most products and parts that are made out of plastic today are mass produced using a technique called injection molding. This process is extremely expensive and time-consuming to set up, but once it is up and running, it can reproduce hundreds of thousands of identical individual items at an extremely low cost. It is a classic large-batch production process. This has put entrepreneurs who want to develop a new physical product at a disadvantage, since in general only large companies can afford these large production runs for a new product. However, new technologies are allowing entrepreneurs to build small batches of products that are of the same quality as products made with injection molding, but at much lower cost and much, much faster.

If a mistake happens, shame on us for making it so easy to make that mistake.


# Things My Son Needs to Know About The World (Backman, Fredrik)

When those Swiss physicists appeared in the media a couple of years ago talking about their groundbreaking research and the discovery of a ‘previously unknown particle’ that could travel faster than the speed of light, and the entire world was wondering what this new particle might consist of, all parents with small children looked at one another in unison and just said: ‘Poop. I bet anything it’s poop.’.

We want you to be better than us. Because if our kids don’t grow up to be better than us, then what’s the point of all this? We want you to be kinder, smarter, more humble, more generous, and more selfless than we are. We want to give you the very best circumstances we can possibly provide. So we follow sleeping methods and go to seminars and buy ergonomic bathtubs and push car-seat salesmen up against the wall and shout, ‘The safest! I want THE SAFEST, doyouhearme?!’ (Not that I’ve ever done that, of course; you shouldn’t pay so much attention to what your mother.

I want THE SAFEST, doyouhearme?!’ (Not that I’ve ever done that, of course; you shouldn’t pay so much attention to what your mother says.).

So indescribably scared of not being good enough. Because we spent so long being the biggest narcissists in world history before we became parents and realized how unimportant we really were.

The realization that you will, from that moment on, draw all your breaths through someone else’s lungs hits you harder when you aren’t prepared.

Let function come before form. Buy the sofa you want, not the sofa you need. Trust me. You’ll never get the chance again.

So find someone who doesn’t love you for the person you are, but despite the person you are.

Focus on the fact that you’ve actually found someone who can see themselves storing their crap in the same place as your crap.

Focus on the fact that you’ve actually found someone who can see themselves storing their crap in the same place as your crap. Because, hand on heart: you have a lot of crap.

People sometimes ask me how I lived before I met your mother. I answer that I didn’t.

Because one day I’ll look away for two seconds and when I turn around again you’ll be all grown up.

So play. Learn. Grow up. Follow your passions. Find someone to love. Do your best. Be kind when you can, tough when you need to be. Hold on to your friends. Don’t go against the direction of the painted arrows in the floor. You’ll be just fine.

When you were born, it was like someone carbonated the air in my lungs. Like you blew bubbles into my blood through a straw. My entire life was about nothing but me for twenty-five years, but then your mother came along and then you came along and now I wake up in the middle of the night several times a week and have to check you’re both still breathing before I can get back to sleep. Can you grasp that? If I’d acted this way before I became someone’s dad, they would have locked me up in a padded cell with an iPod full of dolphin songs.

And I know all kids sooner or later reach a point in their lives where they realize their dads aren’t actually superheroes.

And we can never allow stuff to become more important than people.

They’re not people. They’re Swiss Army knives with beards.

Not because my generation’s skills will be useless in that situation, that’s not what I’m saying at all. We’re just not going to be able to use a single one of them until someone has reinvented electricity.

She’s someone everyone trusts. I can easily think of a hundred people who would follow her blindly into war. I can barely get people to follow me on Twitter.

Want you to always remember that you can become whatever you want to become, but that’s nowhere near as important as knowing that you can be exactly who you are.

Because the only thing you can give to men who already have everything is a second chance. And you’re all of their second chances. Every day.

The one where it says PLEASE STAND BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. I genuinely never feel more spiritual than when I see that line.

As long as you are kind to your mother and don’t murder or steal or start supporting Manchester City or any other horrible thing like that, I genuinely don’t care whether your moral compass is shaped by an old book or a box of jam doughnuts.

Because when you’re with her, it’s always Sunday morning.

All we want is for your psychologists to mutter, in twenty years’ time, that it might not be e-n-t-i-r-e-l-y our fault.

And one of the few ways we can convince ourselves that we’re actually decent as parents is by making other people seem like bad parents.

So, son, let me explain to you that all this that you see around you right now is called ‘life’. It’s going to be complicated at times and it’s going to demand certain things of you. You’ll need to be honest and brave and just. Love and be loved. Fail. Embarrass yourself. Triumph. Fall from something. Fall for someone.

A real friend won’t steal your crush. A real friend won’t ninja loot your warrior in World of Warcraft.

There aren’t really any fundamental requirements for that, of course. But since we’re already on the subject, let’s establish a few all the same: A real friend won’t steal your crush. A real friend won’t ninja loot your warrior in World of Warcraft. Yeah, that’s basically it.

I lumber through life with my hands in my pockets; she dances. I don’t actually know anything she loves doing as much as she loves dancing, and I can’t find the rhythm in a clock. People have said lots of things about us, but trust me, no one has ever said that we were destined for each other.

I want.

I want you to always remember that you can become whatever.

I want you to always remember that you can become whatever you want to become, but that’s nowhere near as important as knowing that you can be exactly who you are.


# The Five People You Meet In Heaven (Albom, Mitch)

By his 83rd birthday, Eddie had lost nearly everyone he’d cared about. Some had died young, and some had been given a chance to grow old before a disease or an accident took them away.

“People think of heaven as a paradise garden, a place where they can float on clouds and laze in rivers and mountains. But scenery without solace is meaningless.

“That there are no random acts. That we are all connected. That you can no more separate one life from another than you can separate a breeze from the wind.”.

“Fairness,” he said, “does not govern life and death. If it did, no good person would ever die young.”.

“Strangers,” the Blue Man said, “are just family you have yet to come to know.”.

“No life is a waste,” the Blue Man said. “The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.”.

“You didn’t get it. Sacrifice is a part of life. It’s supposed to be. It’s not something to regret. It’s something to aspire to. Little sacrifices. Big sacrifices. A mother works so her son can go to school. A daughter moves home to take care of her sick father.

“That’s the thing. Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you’re not really losing it. You’re just passing it on to someone else.”.

ALL PARENTS DAMAGE their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely.

ALL PARENTS DAMAGE their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.

“You made me love you I didn’t want to do it, I didn’t want to do.

PARENTS RARELY LET go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away.

Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.

LOVE, LIKE RAIN, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy. But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.

“Lost love is still love, Eddie. It takes a different form, that’s all. You can’t see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken, another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it. “Life has to end,” she said. “Love doesn’t.”.

That each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.


# How to Read a Book (Doren, Charles Van;Mortimer J. Adler)

When my love swears that she is made of truth.

When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her, though I know she lies,.

It is much easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth.

The victories are now meaningless, and the defeats without pain. The cities that were taken and lost have crumbled into dust. Indeed, if we stop to think of it, almost all that remains of the Peloponnesian War is Thucydides’ account of.


# Mastering Modern World History (Norman Lowe)

Imperialism is the building up of an empire by seizing territory overseas.

Most of Africa was taken over by the European states in what became known as the ‘the Scramble for Africa’; the idea behind it was mainly to get control of new markets and new sources of raw materials.

Government caused the Chinese to overthrow the ancient Manchu dynasty.

The Austrians blamed the Serb government and sent a harsh ultimatum. The Serbs accepted most of the demands in it, but the Austrians, with a promise of German support, were determined to use the incident as an excuse for war. On 28 July, Austria–Hungary declared war on Serbia. The Russians, anxious not to let the Serbs down again, ordered a general mobilization (29 July). The German government demanded that this should be cancelled (31 July), and when the Russians failed to comply, Germany declared war on Russia (1 August) and on France (3 August). When German troops entered Belgium on their way to invade France, Britain (who in 1839 had promised to defend Belgian neutrality) demanded their withdrawal. When this demand was ignored, Britain entered the war (4 August). Austria–Hungary declared war on Russia on 6 August. Others countries joined later.

Perhaps the most sensible conclusion is that Germany, Russia and Austria–Hungary must both share the responsibility for the outbreak of war in 1914.

Although they had six and a quarter million men mobilized by the end of 1914, a third of them were without rifles.

Although they had six and a quarter million men mobilized by the end of 1914, a third of them were without rifles. The Russians never recovered from this setback, whereas German self-confidence was boosted.

During the attack on Ypres in 1915, the Germans used poison gas, but when the wind changed direction it was blown back towards their own lines and they suffered more casualties then the Allies, especially when the Allies released some gas of their own.

It was after one of the disastrous attacks in 1915 that a German officer remarked that the British army were ‘lions led by donkeys’.

After 1935, therefore, the League was never taken seriously again. The real explanation for the failure of the League was simple: when aggressive states such as Japan, Italy and Germany defied it, the League members, especially France and Britain, were not prepared to support it, either by decisive economic measures or by military action. The League was only as strong as the determination of its leading members to stand up to aggression; unfortunately, determination of that sort was sadly lacking during the 1930s.

Mussolini knew what he wanted, which was ‘to make Italy great, respected and feared’, but he was not sure how to achieve this, apart from agitating for a revision of the 1919 peace settlement in Italy’s favour.

‘National boundaries’, he said, ‘are only made by man and can be changed by man.’.

Remove the stigma of defeat in the First World War: ‘for the only antidote to defeat in one war is victory in the next’.

But Taylor was not defending Hitler; just the opposite, in fact – Hitler was still to blame, and so were the German people, for being aggressive. ‘Hitler was the creation of German history and of the German present. He would have counted for nothing without the support and cooperation of the German people. … Many hundred thousand Germans carried out his evil orders without qualm or question.’.

Sometimes raids seem to have been carried out to undermine civilian morale, as when about 50 000 people were killed during a single night raid on Dresden (February 1945).

Operation Overlord – the invasion of France (also known as the Second Front) – began on ‘D-Day’, 6 June 1944.

No attempts were made to negotiate peace with either Germany or Japan until they had both surrendered. Thomas Fleming, writing in History Today (December 2001), calculated that in the period from DDay until the end of the war in August 1945, close on two million people were killed. Many of these lives could perhaps have been saved if there had been the prospect of a negotiated peace to encourage the German resistance to overthrow Hitler. As it was, concludes Fleming, the policy of unconditional.

Japan agreed to surrender all territory acquired during the previous 90 years, which included.

Japan agreed to surrender all territory acquired during the previous 90 years, which included a complete withdrawal from China.

There was a general view in the USA at this time that it was quite permissible for them to interfere in the affairs of sovereign states and to overthrow any regimes which they felt were hostile and too close for comfort (see Chapter 26).

Korea, which had been controlled by Japan since 1910. After the Japanese defeat in 1945, the country was divided into two zones: the north occupied by the Russians, the south by the Americans. The Russians set up a communist government in their zone, and since no agreement could be reached on what government to have for the whole country, Korea, like Germany, remained divided into two states. In 1950 communist North Korea invaded South Korea. United Nations forces (mostly American) moved in to help the south, while the Chinese helped the north. After much advancing and retreating, the war ended in 1953 with South Korea still non-communist.

Often the regimes that were labelled as communist and targeted for removal were simply pursuing policies which went against American interests. US activities were carried out sometimes in secret, leaving the American people largely unaware of what was going on, or, as in the case of major military interventions, were presented as necessary surgical actions against the cancer of communism. Techniques included attempts to carry out assassinations, rigging of elections, organizing and financing acts of terrorism, economic destabilization and, in the last resort, full-scale military intervention.

The word ‘détente’ is used to mean a permanent relaxation of tensions between East and West.

In practice it has gradually been accepted that abstention by a permanent member does not count as a veto, but this has not been written into the Charter.

In 1984 for example, Nicaragua sued the USA for mining its harbours; the Court judged in favour of Nicaragua and ordered the USA to pay compensation. The USA refused to accept the verdict, and no further action was taken. Although in theory the Security Council has the power to take ‘appropriate measures’ to enforce the Court’s decisions, it has never done so. The Court can only operate successfully when both parties to a dispute agree to accept the verdict, whichever way it should happen to go. (e)  The Trusteeship Council This replaced the League of Nations Mandates Commission, which had originally come into existence in 1919 to keep an eye on the territories taken away from Germany and Turkey at the end of the First World War. Some of these areas (known as mandated territories or mandates) had been handed over to the victorious powers, and their job was to govern the territories and prepare them for independence (see Sections 2.8 and 2.10). The Trusteeship Council did its job well and by 1970 most of the mandates had gained their independence (see Sections 11.1(b) and Chapter 24). However, Namibia remained a problem, since South Africa refused to give the area independence. South Africa, ruled by a government representing the white minority of the population, was unwilling to give independence to a state right on its own frontier that would be ruled by a government representing its black African majority. The UN repeatedly condemned South Africa for its attitude; in 1971 the International Court of Justice ruled that South Africa’s occupation of Namibia was a breach of international law and that South Africa must withdraw immediately. South Africa ignored the UN, but as the other states of Africa gradually gained independence under black governments,.

First on the list was to be Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and action was also threatened against Iran and North Korea – three states which, according to Bush, formed an ‘axis of evil’.

They implied that the USA, the world’s only superpower – all-powerful and unchallengeable – was now committed to good works; support for international justice, liberty and human rights; the eradication of poverty; and the spread of education, health and democracy throughout the world.

‘The Americans should not deny the fact that of all the nations in the history of the world, theirs is the most just, the most tolerant and the best model for the future.’.

‘the international financial system has been shaped to extend US financial and political power, not to promote the world public good’.

Ken Booth and Tim Dunne, in their recent book Worlds in Collision, offer this definition: Terrorism is a method of political action that uses violence (or deliberately produces fear) against civilians and against civilian infrastructure in order to influence behaviour, to inflict punishment or to exact revenge. For the perpetrators, the point is to make the target group afraid of today, afraid of tomorrow and afraid of each other. Terrorism is an act, not an ideology. Its instruments are assassination, mass murder, hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and intimidation. Such acts can be committed by states as well as private groups.

In the 1960s Nelson Mandela was regarded as a terrorist by the white governments of South Africa and kept in jail for 27 years; now he is respected and revered by both blacks and whites all over the world. What about Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader? President Bush refused to meet him because, according to the Americans, he was nothing but a terrorist. Yet when the Israeli government carried out similar attacks to those perpetrated by the Palestinians, this was classified not as terrorism, but as legitimate actions of a government against terrorism. Clearly it depends which side you are on, and which side wins in the end.

Consisting mainly of Sunni Muslims, it was formed towards the end of the 1980s as part of the struggle to expel the Soviet forces which had invaded Afghanistan in 1979 (see Section 8.6(b)).

A secondary aim was to bring an end to US support for Israel.

Al-Qaeda’s aim was to force the Americans to withdraw their troops so that an Islamic regime would be able to come to power.

Perhaps the best-known terrorist group outside the Middle East has been the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. They were Hindus living in the north and east of Sri Lanka, whereas the majority of the island’s population were Buddhist. The Tigers campaigned since the early 1980s for an independent homeland, using suicide bombings, assassinations of leading politicians, and attacks on public buildings and Buddhist shrines. By the 1990s they had over 10 000 troops and the struggle had reached civil-war proportions. Their most notorious action was the assassination of the Indian prime minister, Rajiv Ghandi, in India in 1991. A truce was arranged in 2001, and although it was broken several times, by 2003 there were encouraging signs that a peaceful settlement could be found.

Probably the most successful terrorist group was the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa. Originally formed in 1912, it only adopted violent methods in the early 1960s when apartheid became more brutal. After a long campaign, the white supremacist government eventually succumbed to pressure from world opinion as well as from the ANC. Nelson Mandela was released (1990), and multiracial elections were held (1994). Mandela, the former ‘terrorist’, became the first black president of South Africa. There have been scores of other organizations, for example the Tupamaru Revolutionary Movement in Peru, which aims to rid the country of US influence; the Islamic Group in Algeria, which aims to set up an Islamic state in place of the existing non-religious government; and the National Liberation Army in Bolivia, which aims to rid the country of US influence.

The other main message emphasized was total obedience to authority; this was deemed necessary because everything was seen in terms of struggle – ‘Believe, Obey, Fight!’.

In March 1921 Lenin banned ‘factionalism’ within the Party. This meant that discussion would be allowed, but once a decision had been taken, all sections of the Party had to stick to it. Anybody who persisted in holding a view different from the official party line would be expelled from the Party. During the rest of 1921 about one-third of the Party’s members were ‘purged’ (expelled) with the help of the ruthless Cheka; many more resigned, mainly because they were against NEP.

The main political problem now for Lenin was disagreement and criticism within the Communist Party.

Devoted to Karl Marx’s vision of socialism, in which the working class would control the machines, factories and other sorts of wealth production, the communists led by Lenin believed that the future social order would be based on the abolition of unearned social privilege, the end of racism and colonial oppression, the secularization of society, and the empowerment of working people. Yet within a generation Stalin and his closest comrades had created one of the most vicious and oppressive states in modern history.

Trotsky was exiled from the USSR and went to live in Istanbul in Turkey.

Writers who did not succeed in producing the right kind of socialist realism ran the risk of arrest. Stalin himself sometimes read novels in typescript and would add comments and suggest changes which the authors were expected to take note of. In the later 1930s many writers were arrested and kept in labour camps for long periods or even executed. Among the best-known victims were the poet Osip Mandelstam, who had written a poem criticizing Stalin; he was sent to a labour camp, where he died. Evgenia Ginsburg spent 18 years in prison and labour camps after being accused of organizing a writers’ terrorist group.

There was a new freedom in news reporting: in April 1986, for example, when a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in the Ukraine exploded, killing hundreds of people and releasing a massive radioactive cloud which drifted across most of Europe, the disaster was discussed with unprecedented frankness. The aims of this new approach were to use the media to publicize the inefficiency and corruption which the government was so anxious to stamp out, to educate public opinion and to mobilize support for the new policies. Glasnost was encouraged provided nobody criticized the Party itself.

One important achievement was that the system brought benefits in the form of promotion, and reasonably well-paid jobs with privileges, to large numbers of people from ‘lower-class’ backgrounds who had been excluded from such things under the tsarist regime.

Education and literacy became more widespread; Soviet ‘culture’ was encouraged and so was sport; the performing arts, especially music, were subsidized by the state, and science was given special prominence and funding. Perhaps the greatest achievement of communism was that it played a vital role in defeating the evil regime of Hitler and the Nazis. After Stalin’s death, although in one sense the country stagnated, the system brought a certain stability and an improved standard of living for the majority of its people.

By 1993 Russians were bitterly referring to dermocracy – dermo being the Russian for “shit”.’ Sadly, corruption, fraud, bribery and criminal activity became part of everyday life in Russia.

He stressed the necessity for loyalty in all relationships and for the strict upbringing of children.

‘Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, the father a father, and a son a son.’.

What comes out of this massive and detailed dossier is a tale of horror in which Chairman Mao emerges as one of the greatest mass murderers in human history, responsible for the premature deaths of at least 45 million people between 1958 and 1962. It is not merely the extent of the catastrophe that dwarfs earlier estimates, but also the manner in which many people died: between two and three million victims were tortured to death or summarily killed, often for the slightest infraction. When a boy stole a handful of grain in a Hunan village, local boss Xiong Dechang, forced his father to bury him alive. The father died of grief a few days later. … The killing of slackers, weaklings, those too ill to work, or otherwise unproductive elements, increased the overall food supply for those who contributed to the regime through their labour. At one meeting Mao announced: ‘It is better to let half the people die so that the other half can eat their.

The Cultural Revolution caused great disruption, ruined millions of lives and probably held up China’s economic development by ten years. And yet in spite of that, there was probably some economic recovery in the last few years before Mao’s death.

Later, events in the USSR seemed to prove them right: when Mikhail Gorbachev tried to introduce economic and political reforms both at the same time, he failed; the Communist Party lost control, the economic reforms were a disaster, and the USSR broke.

Later, events in the USSR seemed to prove them right: when Mikhail Gorbachev tried to introduce economic and political reforms both at the same time, he failed; the Communist Party lost control, the economic reforms were a disaster, and the USSR broke up into 15 separate states (see Section 18.3).

‘Leadership by the Party’, he said, ‘is the fundamental guarantee that the people are the masters of the country and that the country is ruled by law.’.

The financier George Soros believes that China has ‘not only a more vigorous economy, but actually a better-functioning government than the United States’.

However, the parties are not as united or as tightly organized as political parties in Britain, where all the MPs belonging to the government party are expected to support the government all the time. In the USA, party discipline is much weaker, and votes in Congress often cut across party lines. There are left- and right-wingers in both parties. Some right-wing Democrats voted against Roosevelt’s New Deal even though he was a Democrat, while some left-wing Republicans voted for it. But they did not change parties, and their party did not throw them out.

A President’s success has usually depended on how skilful he is at persuading Congress to approve his legislative programme.

The Republicans criticized Johnson for wanting to spend money on the poor instead of concentrating on Vietnam; they were supporters of the strong American tradition of self-help: it was up to the poor to help themselves and wrong to use taxpayers’ money on schemes which, it was thought, would only make the poor more lazy.

All sorts of people were accused of being communists: socialists, liberals, intellectuals, artists, pacifists and anyone whose views did not appear orthodox were attacked and hounded out of their jobs for ‘un-American activities’.

‘Government is not the solution to our problems,’ he told the nation; ‘government is the problem.’ Consequently he aimed to remove restrictions on business, to reduce government spending on welfare (though not on defence), to balance the federal budget, to introduce a free-market economy, and to control the money supply in order to keep inflation low.

For example, would the British have left East and Central Africa for purely ‘metropolitan’ reasons if there had been no nationalist movements in these areas? Of course there is no simple answer. What can be said with certainty is that all these factors were present in varying degrees in all colonial territories.

One reason given by the Americans for wanting to see the end of the European empires was that delays in granting independence to European colonies in Asia and Africa would encourage the development of communism in those areas.

The British proposed a federal scheme in which the central government would have only limited powers, while those of the provincial governments would be much greater. This would enable provinces with a Muslim majority to control their own affairs and there would be no need for a separate state. Both sides accepted the idea in principle but failed to agree on the details.

This practice of exercising influence over former colonies after independence by economic means became known as neo-colonialism; it became widespread in most of the new states of the Third World.

During a severe famine in Bengal in 1942–3, Churchill refused to divert shipping to take food supplies to Calcutta. The result – over 3 million people died from starvation.

Man in the state of Zamfara lost his right hand for stealing the equivalent of £25. Punishments are especially severe on women: committing adultery and becoming pregnant outside marriage can bring a sentence of death by stoning. By the end of 2002, 12 of the 19 states – those in the north, which are mainly Muslim – had adopted Sharia law into their legal systems. Sharia was only applied to Muslims, but it was opposed by many Christians, who thought it was barbaric and medieval.

Chief Luthuli still persevered with non-violent protests, and after publishing his moving autobiography Let My People Go, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was killed in 1967, the authorities claiming that he had deliberately stepped in front of a train.

However, as so often happens when an authoritarian regime tries to reform itself, it proved impossible to stop the process of change (the same happened in the USSR when Gorbachev tried to reform communism). By the late 1980s international pressure on South Africa was having more effect, and internal attitudes had changed.

British prime minister Margaret Thatcher would commit Britain only to a voluntary ban on investment in South Africa. Her argument was that severe economic sanctions would worsen the plight of black Africans, who would be thrown out of their jobs. This caused the rest of the Commonwealth to feel bitter against Britain; Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, accused Mrs Thatcher of ‘compromising on basic principles and values for economic ends’.

Third World consisted of Africa, Asia (except the USSR and China), India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Latin America and the Middle East.

The Third World states were in favour of non-alignment, which means that they did not want to be too closely associated with either the capitalist or the communist bloc, and they were very suspicious of the motives of both. Prime Minister Nehru of India (1947–64) saw himself as a sort of unofficial leader of the Third World, which he thought could be a powerful force for world peace. Third World countries deeply resented the fact that both blocs continued to interfere in their internal affairs (neo-colonialism). The USA, for example, interfered unashamedly in the affairs of Central and South America, helping to overthrow governments which they did not approve of; this happened in Guatemala (1954), the Dominican Republic (1965) and Chile (1973). Britain, France and the USSR interfered in the Middle East. Frequent meetings of Third World leaders were held, and in 1979, 92 nations were represented at a ‘non-aligned’ conference in Havana (Cuba). By this time the Third World contained roughly 70 per cent of the world’s population.

Economically the Third World was extremely poor. For example, although they contained 70 per cent of the world’s population, Third World countries only consumed 30 per cent of the world’s food, while the USA, with perhaps 8 per cent of the world’s population, ate 40 per cent of the world’s food. Third World people were often short of proteins and vitamins, and this caused poor health and a high death-rate. In 1980 an international group of politicians under the chairmanship of Willi Brandt (who had been chancellor of West Germany from 1967 until 1974), and including Edward Heath (prime minister of Britain 1970–4), produced a report (the Brandt Report) on the problems of the Third World. It said that the world could be roughly divided into two parts (see Map 27.1).

GNP is calculated by taking the total money value of a country’s total output from all units of production, wherever production is situated; and it includes interest, profits and dividends received from abroad.

By 1985 very few countries had reached the suggested 0.7 per cent giving target. Those that did were Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and France; however, the USA.

‘I will not accept a plan that will harm our economy and hurt American workers’, he said. ‘First things first are the people who live in America. That’s my priority.’.

A few scientists have suggested that the best thing is to do nothing at all at present, and hope that future scientists will find new and cheap methods of reducing greenhouse gases.

For example John Rawls, in his book A Theory of Justice (Oxford University Press, 1973), put forward a theory of ‘justice as fairness’. He argued in favour of equality and claimed that it was the duty of government to provide welfare and some redistribution of wealth through taxation.

Probably the most common type of derivatives are futures; a future is a contract in which you agree to buy something at a future date, but at a price decided on now. The hope is that in the meantime the price will go up, enabling you to sell it again at a profit.

Goldman Sachs believed that by 2020 all the BRIC countries would be in the world’s top 10 economies, and that by 2050 they would be the top four, with China in first place.

China would continue to dominate world markets in manufactured goods, India would specialize in providing services, while Russia and Brazil would be the leading suppliers of raw materials.

China would continue to dominate world markets in manufactured goods, India would specialize in providing services, while Russia and Brazil would be the leading suppliers of raw materials. By working together in this way the BRIC states can present an effective challenge to the entrenched interests and systems of the West. However, the fact that these four countries have very little in common could mean that any economic and political cooperation would only be temporary, or rather artificial. Once China becomes the world’s largest economy, it might not need the other three. In that case it could be China and the USA that work together to lead the global economy.

There seemed no way in which food production could be doubled from less land. In 1996, on average there were 1.8 acres of cropland to each American and the US diet was made up of 31 per cent animal products. By 2050 there was likely to be only 0.6 of an acre per head. The Stanford scientists came to the conclusion that the solution was for people everywhere to eat less meat; it was suggested that by 2050 the US diet would probably be about 85 per cent vegetarian.

The French school was totally different from the district school.

The newness wore off and we became accustomed to the sight of Feride in the kitchen and I still continued at school. One evening when I returned from school I saw that my mother had guests. I flung my satchel on the hall table, washed my hands and went into the salon, where my greater years or the slight relaxation of.

Life was full of resentments for me just then. I was very hurt and puzzled by my parents’ attitude towards the kissing of Yasemin and angry that nobody would give any reasonable explanation as to why I should not kiss her.

Some things in life stand out sharply in the memory, making a picture so vivid, so clear-cut, that the mind’s eye retains them indelibly forever.

‘You will be father from now on,’ he said and I pressed my head against his face and felt a tear drop on my cheek. Whose tear was it, mine or his? Perhaps it fell from both of us for tears tormented both of us.

The legend of aşure is that when Noah in the Ark found himself running short of supplies, he ordered all the remaining foods to be cooked together for one last gigantic meal.

There are some things in the heart that do not die and the loves of early childhood are the strongest loves of all.

To my grandmother, I never saw him anything else but coldly polite. She was an obstinate, self-willed woman with a wounding tongue and I imagine his pride suffered badly beneath her hands.

There is something so elemental, so primeval about human tears that the sound of them causes ripples and tremors to course up and down the spine and through the blood-stream and my own tears that day had just that effect upon me.

‘Dogs!’ she had shouted passionately. ‘My husband left five children behind him, and a mother to support. Are you going to support them, you miserable sons of bitches? Did my husband ask to be taken from his work and his family to fight for people like you? Will you give us food to put in our hungry stomachs? Do you care if we go hungry and naked, if strange men insult us in the streets or if our children die of disease and starvation? Our husbands died to save their country and then bastards like you shut the windows in our faces, because we ask for news.

‘Always remember! Never let anyone know when you are desperate. Put your best clothes on and pride on your face and you can get anything in this world.’.

‘Because otherwise you will get nothing but kicks,’ she roared. ‘If that Jew had known how desperate I was, he would have succeeded in beating me down to his own price. As it was, I succeeded in beating him. Why,’ she continued complacently, ‘he even complimented me on my jewellery,’ and she patted the emerald pendant affectionately. ‘Your grandfather always had very good taste and only bought the best.’.

I wonder, did my mother make her decision with tears and misgivings or with relief that at last a place was found to house us, so that she need no longer feel responsibility for us? These are questions to which only she knew the answer, and she did not tell us these things. But it is not an idle thing to say that the heart and mind and spirit of a child can be broken, and the events of that melancholy day governed the whole of my future life. Love can die as easily in the childish heart, if more bitterly, as in the adult. Where the senses scream and beat helplessly against the ruthlessness of a decision, whether lightly made or not, and are forced to fall back, unrecognised, unheard, then love dies too, although a child would not call it that. Perhaps it is only fully realised afterwards, when the child himself becomes adult and feels an old enmity, looking back to that withered day.

May 15th, 1919, is a date in Turkish history for on that day Kemal Atatürk sailed towards Samsun. It was the date the Admiral of the British Mediterranean Fleet declared that the Greeks would occupy İzmir – and that was the date too that I entered Kuleli. Young and insignificant and as yet untried by life, yet could I also claim a share in the date that was making Turkish history.

Upanishads Around the time that the Buddha was preaching and perhaps a little earlier, other thinkers also tried to find answers to difficult questions. Some of them wanted to know about life after death, others wanted to know why sacrifices should be performed. Many of these thinkers felt that there was something permanent in the universe that would last even after death.

Upanishad literally means ‘approaching and sitting near’ and the texts contain conversations between teachers and students.

Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten when the followers.

The word ‘Hindu’, like the term ‘India’ is derived from the river Indus. It was used by Arabs and Iranians to refer to people who lived to the east of the river, and to their cultural practices, including religious beliefs.

There were many other things that were made and used in the past. Those who study these objects are called archaeologists. They study the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, paintings and sculpture. They also explore and excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that are made of hard, imperishable substances usually survive for a long time. Archaeologists also look for bones — of animals, birds, and fish — to find out what people ate in the past. Plant remains survive far more rarely — if seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, they survive in a charred form.

By contrast, in the early sixteenth century Babur used Hindustan to describe the geography, the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent. As we will see later in the chapter, this was somewhat similar to the way the fourteenth-century poet Amir Khusrau used the word “Hind”. While the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like “India” did exist, the term “Hindustan” did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today.

A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king promotes justice and honest governance.

In 1236 Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya, became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, recognised that she was more able and qualified than all her brothers.

The Mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers. From their mother’s side they were descendants of Genghis Khan (died 1227), ruler of the Mongol tribes, China and Central Asia.

From their father’s side they were the successors of Timur (died 1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey. However, the Mughals did not like to be called Mughal or Mongol. This was because Genghis Khan’s memory was associated with the massacre of innumerable people. It was also linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol competitors. On the other hand, the Mughals were proud of their Timurid ancestry, not least of all because their great ancestor had captured Delhi in 1398..

Shankara, one of the most influential philosophers of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century. He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme God which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless and without any attributes. He considered the world around us to be an illusion or maya, and preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman and attain salvation.

Consider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me!

Mr Chairman, at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.

But in 1792, attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas, the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company, Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were taken away as hostages.

With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered.

In the late 1830s the East India Company became worried about Russia. It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the north-west. Driven by this fear, the British now wanted to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842 and established indirect Company rule there.

What is this country of India and for whom is it meant? The answer that gradually emerged was: India was the people of India – all the people irrespective of class, colour, caste, creed, language, or gender. And the country, its resources and systems, were meant for all of them. With this answer came the awareness that the British were exercising control over the resources of India and the lives of its people, and until this control was ended India could not be for Indians.

They worked with the idea that the people should be sovereign – a modern consciousness and a key feature of nationalism.

Non-violence comes to us through doing good continually without the slightest expectation of return. … That is the indispensable lesson in non-violence … In South Africa … I succeeded in learning the eternal law of suffering as the only remedy for undoing wrong and injustice.

Besides Muslims, India also had large populations of Sikhs and Christians, as well as many Parsis and Jains. Under the new Constitution, they would have the same rights as Hindus – the same opportunities when it came to seeking jobs in government or the private sector, the same rights before the law.

We have a Muslim minority who are so large in numbers that they cannot, even if they want, go anywhere else. That is a basic fact about which there can be no argument.

France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their independence from the common enemy, Britain.

Under Louis XVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their independence from the common enemy, Britain.

French society in the eighteenth century was divided into three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.

The society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to the middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the society and institutions of France before 1789.

All of these were educated and believed that no group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a person’s social position must depend on his merit.

As you know, a republic is a form of government where the people elect the government including the head of the government.

Louis XVI was sentenced to death by a court on the charge of treason. On 21 January 1793 he was executed publicly at the Place de la Concorde. The queen Marie Antoinette met with the same fate shortly after.

Robespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his supporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was convicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and on the next day sent to the guillotine.

Some were ‘conservatives’, others were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’.

Liberals also opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted to safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent of rulers and officials.

Liberals also opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted to safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They argued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent of rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They did not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every citizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the vote. They also did not want the vote for women.

In contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based on the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s suffragette movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges of great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not against the existence of private property but disliked concentration of property in the hands of a few.

Besides the territory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central Asian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Nobles got their power and position through their services to the Tsar, not through local popularity.

They were so valuable that in 1755 when the Mataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were equally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise, it would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to build their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the forests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs work under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch fort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.

The Dutch first imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively to provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting timber. This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead of rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but their right to cultivate forest land was restricted.

The First World War and the Second World War had a major impact on forests. In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and the forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In Java, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed ‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese hands.

In Java, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed ‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese hands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their own war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests. Many villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the forest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service to get this land back. As in India, people’s need for agricultural land has brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire to control the land and exclude people from it.

The Allies would not have been as successful in the First World War and the Second World War if they had not been able to exploit the resources and people of their colonies. Both the world wars had a devastating effect on the forests of India, Indonesia and elsewhere.The forest department cut freely to satisfy war needs.

Conservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a more important goal.

Some reduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not enough pasture to feed large numbers. Others discovered new pastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult. After 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of the Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries between India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had to find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating to Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the harvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that the animals provide. Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and settling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading. Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from moneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns. Yet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions their numbers have expanded over recent decades. When pasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the direction of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined pastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the changes in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry regions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the most viable form of life.

They were, in fact, worried when the inhabitants of the colonies not only began to play the game, but often played it better than the masters; and at times beat the English at their own game.

Society.The rich who could afford to play it for pleasure were called amateurs and the poor who played it for a living were called professionals.

To play for the pleasure of playing and not for money was an aristocratic value. Two, there was not enough money in the game for the rich to be interested.

It was the English lead in trade and industry that made Britain the world’s greatest power, but it suited the English ruling class to believe that it was the superior character of its young men, built in boarding schools, playing gentlemanly games like cricket, that tipped the balance.

Cricket fans know that watching a match involves taking sides. In a Ranji Trophy match when Delhi plays Mumbai, the loyalty of spectators depends on which city they come from or support. When India plays Australia, the spectators watching the match on television in Bhopal or Chennai feel involved as Indians – they are moved by nationalist loyalties. But through the early history of Indian first-class cricket, teams were not organised on geographical principles and it was not till 1932 that a national team was given the right to represent India in a Test match. So how were teams organised and, in the absence of regional or national teams, how did cricket fans choose sides?.

Western-style clothing was also especially attractive to groups of dalit converts to Christianity who now found it liberating. Here too, it was men rather than women who affected the new dress styles.

The First World War had ended with the defeat of Ottoman Turkey.

Nationalism spreads when people begin to believe that they are all part of the same nation, when they discover some unity that binds them together.

It is believed that noodles travelled west from China to become spaghetti.

In fact, many of our common foods came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.

Many of our common foods such as potatoes, soya, groundnuts, maize, tomatoes, chillies, sweet potatoes, and so on were not known to our ancestors until about five centuries ago. These foods were only introduced in Europe and Asia after Christopher Columbus accidentally discovered the vast continent that would later become known as the Americas. (Here we will use ‘America’ to describe North America, South America and the Caribbean.) In fact, many of our common foods came from America’s original inhabitants – the American Indians.

On the one side were the Allies – Britain, France and Russia (later joined by the US); and on the opposite side were the Central Powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey.

The assembly line forced workers to repeat a single task mechanically and continuously – such as fitting a particular part to the car – at a pace dictated by the conveyor belt. This was a way of increasing the output per worker by speeding up the pace of work. Standing in front of a conveyor belt no worker could afford to delay the motions, take a break, or even have a friendly word with a workmate. As a result, Henry Ford’s cars came off the assembly line at three-minute intervals, a speed much faster than that achieved by previous methods. The T-Model Ford was the world’s first mass-produced.

But markets alone could not guarantee full employment. Therefore governments would have to step in to minimise fluctuations of price, output and employment. Economic stability could be ensured only through the intervention of the government. The second lesson related to a country’s economic links with the outside world. The goal of full employment could only be achieved if governments had power to control flows of goods, capital and labour.

# Six Records of a Floating Life (Shen Fu)

It is this kind of small but significant alteration to our perceptions and presumptions which the Six Records can effect that makes it so important a book for Westerners.

Chinese readers find something else in it. It must be recalled how common arranged marriages were among the Chinese until quite recently.

Chinese readers find something else in it. It must be recalled how common arranged marriages were among the Chinese until quite recently. Even now, a great deal of parental influence, or economic or social coercion, is still present as an influence in the choice of marriage partners in many Chinese societies.

The first was a rule against assigning magistrates to their home districts.

The second practice arose from the Chinese determination that government officials should be scholars first and bureaucrats second.

The second practice arose from the Chinese determination that government officials should be scholars first and bureaucrats second. One of the largest empires in the history of the world was administered by a small group of men who, prior to their first assignment, had not had the slightest training in administration, and who knew more about the poetry of a thousand years before than they did about tax law.

‘All things are like spring dreams, passing with no trace.’.

Criticism of my writing will be like the shining of a bright light into a dirty mirror.

My boat cast off just as the peach and the plum flowers were in magnificent bloom. I felt like a bird that had lost its flock. My world was shaken.

Every time the wind would rustle the bamboo trees in the yard, or the moon would shine through the leaves of the banana tree outside my window, I would look out and miss her so terribly that dreams of her took possession of my soul.

We were certain two people had never been happier than we were.

‘Most arguments people have begin with a joke,’ Yün said. ‘Don’t ever argue with me for the fun of it again – it makes me so angry I could die!’.

Up against me, unable to speak a word. The heavy scent of jasmine in her hair assailed my nostrils, so to stop her laughing I patted her on the back and changed the subject, saying, ‘I thought women of ancient times put jasmine flowers in their hair because they resembled pearls. I never realized that the jasmine is so attractive when mixed with the scent of women’s make-up, much more attractive than the lime.’.

I met with Chin-chen and said, ‘My father and you have the friendship of Weiyang.

‘I have been happy as your wife these twenty-three years. You have loved me and sympathized with me in everything, and never rejected me despite my faults. Having had for my husband an intimate friend like you, I have no regrets over this life. I have had warm cotton clothes, enough to eat, and a pleasant home. I have strolled among streams and rocks, at places like the Pavilion of the Waves and the Villa of Serenity. In the midst of life, I have been just like an Immortal. But a true Immortal must go through many incarnations before reaching enlightenment. Who could dare hope to become an Immortal in only one lifetime? In our eagerness for immortality, we have only incurred the wrath of the Creator, and brought on our troubles with our passion. Because you have loved me too much, I have had a short life!’.

‘Even someone who lives a hundred years must still die one day. I am only sorry at having to leave you so suddenly and for so long, halfway through our journey. I will not be able to serve you for all your life, or to see Fengsen’s wedding with my own eyes.’.

‘If you part from me half way I would never want to take another wife,’ I said. ‘You know the saying, “One who has seen the ocean cannot desire a stream, and compared with Wu Mountain there are no clouds anywhere.”.

I would advise all the husbands and wives in the world not to hate one another, certainly, but also not to love too deeply. As it is said, ‘An affectionate couple cannot grow old together.’ My example should serve as a warning to others.

It is apparently sad but true, that a vegetarian stomach cannot stand the taste of meat.


# Fallen Leaves (Will Durant)

I know that life is in its basis a mystery; a river flowing from an unseen source and in its development an infinite subtlety; a “dome of many-colored glass,” too complex for thought, much less for utterance.

Our grasp is greater than our reach; but therefore our reach is made greater than that grasp.

If you find anything original here it will be unintentional, and probably regrettable.

If you find anything original here it will be unintentional, and probably regrettable. Knowledge grows, but wisdom, though it can improve with years, does not progress with centuries. I cannot instruct Solomon.

He cries; he has been so long asleep in the quiet warm womb of his mother; now suddenly he is compelled to breathe, and it hurts; compelled to see light, and it pierces him; compelled to hear noise, and it terrifies him. Cold strikes his skin, and he seems to be all pain. But it is not so; nature protects him against this initial onslaught of the world by dressing him in a general insensitivity. He sees the light only dimly; he hears the sounds as muffled and afar. For the most part he sleeps. His mother calls him a “little monkey,” and she is right; until he walks he will be like an ape, and even less of a biped, the womb-life having given his funny little legs the incalculable flexibility of a frog’s. Not till he talks will he leave the ape behind, and begin to climb precariously to the stature of a human being.

For the rest he learns by imitation, though his parents think he learns by sermons. They teach him gentleness, and beat him; they teach him mildness of speech, and shout at him; they teach him a Stoic apathy to finance, and quarrel before him about the division of their income; they teach him honesty, and answer his most profound questions with lies. Our children bring us up by showing us, through imitation, what we really are.

Life is that which is discontent, which struggles and seeks, which suffers and creates.

It loves new and dangerous things; a man is as young as the risks he takes.

It is asked to be quiet when noise is the vital medium of youth; it is asked to be passive when it longs for action; it is asked to be sober and judicious when its very blood makes youth “a continuous intoxication.” It is the age of abandon, and its motto, undelphianly, is Panta agan—“Everything in excess.” It is never tired; it lives in the present, regrets no yesterdays, and dreads no morrows; it climbs buoyantly a hill whose summit conceals the other side.

For the majority of us it is the only period of life in which we live; most men of forty are but a reminiscence, the burnt-out ashes of what was once a flame.

For the majority of us it is the only period of life in which we live; most men of forty are but a reminiscence, the burnt-out ashes of what was once a flame. The tragedy of life is that it gives us wisdom only when it has stolen youth.

Pouvait!—“If youth knew how, and old age could!”.

Let us ask the gods not for possessions, but for things to do; happiness is in making things rather than in consuming them.

Years ago, when a bespectacled Chinese student described American universities as “athletic associations in which certain opportunities for study are provided for the feeble-bodied,” his remark was not so destructive as he supposed, and it described himself as much as the universities.

Every philosopher, like Plato, should be an athlete; if he is not, let us suspect his philosophy.

“The first requisite of a gentleman,” said Nietzsche, “is to be a perfect animal.”.

Meanwhile youth is learning to read (which is all that one learns in school), and is learning where and how to find what he may later need to know (which is the best of the arts that he acquires in college).

The discovery darkens life for some.

The discovery darkens life for some years; we begin to mourn the brevity of the human span, and the impossibility of wisdom or fulfillment within so limited a circle; we stand at the top of the hill, and without straining our eyes we can see, at its bottom, death. We work all the harder to forget that it is waiting for us; we turn our eyes back in memory to the days that were not darkened with its presence; we revel in the company of the young because they cast over us, transiently and incompletely, their.

A man is as old as his arteries, and as young as his ideas.

The ability to learn decreases with each decade of our lives, as if the association fibers of the brain were accumulated and overlaid in inflexible patterns.

And yet what if it is for life’s sake that we must die? In truth we are not individuals; and it is because we think ourselves such that death seems unforgivable. We are temporary organs of the race, cells in the body of life; we die and drop away that life may remain young and strong. If we were to live forever, growth would be stifled and youth would find no room on the earth. Death, like style, is the removal of rubbish, the.

We are temporary organs of the race, cells in the body of life; we die and drop away that life may remain young and strong. If we were to live forever, growth would be stifled and youth would find no room on the earth. Death, like style, is the removal of rubbish, the circumcision of the superfluous.

Three thousand years ago a man thought that man might fly, and so he built himself wings, and Icarus—his son—trusting them and trying to fly, fell into the sea. Undaunted, life carried on the dream. Thirty generations passed, and Leonardo da Vinci, spirit made flesh, scratched across his drawings (drawings so beautiful that one catches one’s breath with pain on seeing them) plans and calculations for a flying machine, and left in his notes a little phrase that, once heard, rings like a bell in the memory—“There shall be wings.” Leonardo failed and died, but life carried on the dream. Generations passed, and men said man would never fly, for it was not the will of God. And then man flew, and the agelong challenge of the bird was answered. Life is that which can hold a purpose for three thousand years and never yield. The individual fails, but life succeeds. The individual is foolish, but life holds in its blood and seed the wisdom of generations. The individual dies, but life, tireless and undiscourageable, goes on, wondering, longing, planning, trying, mounting, longing.

And when they pass they will cheat death with their children, with parental care that will make their children a little finer than themselves. Life wins.

The world is not “my idea,” as Schopenhauer called it; it is a stern reality of which you and I are passing spawns.

Logic itself is a human creation,.

Logic itself is a human creation, and may be ignored by the universe.

But it was Darwin, too, who opened a way to what John Morley called “the next great task of science—to create a new religion for humanity.”.

If I could live another life, endowed with my present mind and mood, I would not write history or philosophy, but would devote myself to establishing an association of men and women free to have any tolerant theology or no theology at all, but pledged to follow as far as possible the ethics of Christ, including chastity before marriage, fidelity within it, extensive charity, and peaceful opposition to any but the most clearly defensive war.

Personally I should define morality as the consistency of private conduct with public interest as understood by the group.

We give our offspring twenty years of care and education and then conscript them for murder and death in foreign wars. We preach Christ to them and then cheat so much in business that the government has to intervene to protect the consumer against deceptive labels, dangerous cars, poisonous drugs, chemicalized food, and shoddy goods, while the government itself competes in corruption and mendacity.

No one will believe me when I claim that I have often been aroused by the beauty of a woman without desiring her in any physical sense or degree; according to me my excitement was purely esthetic. Perhaps I deceive myself, and I will take no oath as to the lusts hiding in my “unconscious” or in my blood. But I insist that time and again I have longed to approach a woman timidly and thank her for being such a joy to behold, and that in this longing I felt no ambition to possess her, or even to touch her hand.

They give the race fewer geniuses than men do, but also fewer idiots. Intellect is sharpened in men by economic competition or political finagling; women do not need so much of it because they are normally destined to motherhood, in which instinct rules; and usually they win by instinct all that the male has acquired by intellect.

I marvel at the velvet smoothness of her skin, the creamy softness of her hands, the delicate touch with which she strokes your face and lightens your purse.

No biologist could think of God except in feminine terms, for generally, in the world of life, the male is a tributary incident, usually subordinate, sometimes superfluous.

Left the room dazed with shame at my helplessness, and mumbling to myself: “I must always be kind to women.” Let the sins of woman lie gently on her head, for she is the forgiving mother of us all.

In this perspective even eating is subordinate, however primary; it comes first, and without it life could not be; but it, too, is servant to sex; the unconscious purpose of our eating is to preserve and develop us for biological maturity—i.e., the ability to reproduce. When we have fulfilled that function we eat in order to survive as caretakers for our progeny. When we have completed both of these functions nature has no further use or regard for us; normally we would soon thereafter die; if we go on living it is as dispensable bystanders in the procession of life.

Strife is dramatic, and (to most of our historians) peaceful generations appear to have no history.

In our saner moments we know that it is not so; that lucid intervals of peace far outweigh, in any nation’s story, the mad seizures of war; that the history of civilization—of law and morals, science and invention, religion and philosophy, letters and the arts—runs like hidden gold in.

Perhaps all vices were once virtues, indispensable in the struggle for existence; they became vices only in the degree to which social order and increasing security rendered them unnecessary for survival. Once men had to chase, to kill, to grasp, to overeat, to hoard; a hundred millenniums of insecurity bred into the race those acquisitive and possessive impulses which no laws or morals or ideals, but only centuries of security, can mitigate or destroy.

Perhaps all vices were once virtues, indispensable in the struggle for existence; they became vices only in the degree to which social order and increasing security rendered them unnecessary for survival. Once men had to chase, to kill, to grasp, to overeat, to hoard; a hundred millenniums of insecurity bred into the race those acquisitive and possessive impulses which no laws or morals or ideals, but only centuries of security, can mitigate or destroy.

Since, by and large, those groups survived that excelled in food-getting, mate-getting, and fighting, these instincts have been selected and intensified through the generations, and have budded into a hundred secondary forms of acquisition, venery, and strife.

Prejudice is fatal to philosophy, but indispensable to a nation.

These standard provocations to conquest have been sharpened and magnified by the Industrial Revolution. To make war successfully, a modern nation must be wealthy; to be wealthy it must develop industry; to maintain industry, it must, in most cases, import food, fuel, and raw materials; to pay for these, it must export manufactured goods; to sell these, it must find foreign markets; to win these, it must undersell its competitors or wage foreign war. As like as not, it will make war for any of the goods it considers vital, or for control of the routes by which they must come.

Greece fought for control of the Aegean, the Hellespont, and the Black Sea, because it was dependent upon Russian grain. Rome had to conquer Egypt because it needed corn, and Asia Minor because it needed markets for its handicrafts and fortunes for its politicians. Egyptian wheat, Near Eastern oil, and Indian cotton explain many a battle in British history; Spanish silver explains the wars of Rome with Carthage; Spanish copper has something to do with German aid to Fascist Spain. Our sinless selves had a taste for sugar in 1898; and far back in 1853 we pointed our gifts and cannon at a Japanese government and persuaded Japan to transform itself into an industrial nation eager for foreign markets and spoils.

Since men are by nature unequal it follows that in any society a majority of abilities will be possessed by a minority of men;.

Since men are by nature unequal it follows that in any society a majority of abilities will be possessed by a minority of men; from which it follows that sooner or later, in any society, a majority of goods will be possessed by a minority of men. But this natural concentration of wealth impedes, by the repeated reinvestment of profits in promoting production, widespread purchasing power among the people; production leaps ahead of consumption; surpluses rise and generate either depression or war. For either production must stop to let consumption catch up, or foreign markets must be found to take the surplus that was unpurchased at home.

The League of Nations (except under Briand and Stresemann) was a conspiracy of the victors to preserve their gains; it had to fail as soon as the fertility and industry of the defeated had altered the balance of national power prescribed by the Treaty of Versailles.

Pacifism would be a cure for war if it could survive the call to arms and national defense; the same English youth that had, in the Oxford Union, vowed never to take up arms for England, took them up manfully against Hitler.

Vague appeals to the conscience of mankind to put an end to war have had little effect throughout history, for there is no conscience of mankind. Morality is a habit of order generated by centuries of compulsion; international morality awaits international order; international order awaits international force; conscience follows the policeman. A wise people will love peace and keep its powder dry.

The American presidency is a dictatorship limited in time, allowing impotent public criticism, and ultimately guided by generals and admirals. Armed with this strategy, American presidents have repeatedly initiated military intervention in foreign states, and Congress, faced by an accomplished fact, has felt compelled to approve.

I would rather have America lose her empire than have her forfeit all the inspiration that she has meant to mankind.

If the Founding Fathers could come back they would be amazed at the degree to which we have reduced poverty, drudgery, illiteracy, and governmental tyranny. A large part of the utopias described by Thomas More, Samuel Butler, Edward Bellamy, and H. G. Wells has been materially realized, along with the universal education, adult suffrage, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion which were among the hopes and dreams of eighteenth-century philosophers.

What are the needs and impulses that make a man spend years of preparation, and then months of labor, to produce a work of art? Presumably because he wishes to express himself, his ideas, and his moods; because he longs for distinction and reward; because he has a keener sense of beauty than most of us; because he aspires to combine the partial beauties and veiled meanings of actual but transitory forms in a vision of clearer significance or more lasting loveliness. Usually he sees more than we see, in fuller intensity or detail; he wishes to remove some of these perceived aspects in order to leave the essence and import of the scene more movingly visible to our eyes and souls. To do this he may deliberately sacrifice beauty, and crowd a wall or canvas with distorted figures, as in El Greco or Modigliani, or with bloated peasants, as in the Brueghels, or with chaotic horrors, as in Hieronymus Bosch. Philosophers have shown more hesitation in defining beauty than in describing God. Aristotle considered the basic elements of beauty to be symmetry, proportion, and an organic order of parts in a united whole. This conception, like the “Aristotelian unities” in drama, is the classic ideal in literature and art, but it drives Romantic spirits to rebellion and scorn; to them excess is the secret of success, and feeling, not reason, is the source and message of art. Many Japanese artists, tired of symmetry, proportion, and order, found beauty or satisfaction in surprising deviations from regularity of form.

Art without science is poverty, and science without art is barbarism. Let every science strive to fulfill itself in beauty or wisdom, and let us rejoice when a science becomes an art.

That education is of most worth which opens to the body and the soul, to the citizen and the state, the fullest possibilities of their harmonious life.

First, the control of life, through health, character, intelligence, and technology; second, the enjoyment of life, through friendship, nature, literature, and art; and, third, the understanding of life, through history, science, religion, and philosophy. Two processes constitute education and unite in it; in the one, the race transmits to the growing individual its profuse and accumulated heritage of knowledge, techniques, morals, and art; in the other, the individual applies this inheritance to the development of his capacities and the adornment of his life. In proportion as he absorbs this legacy he is transformed from an animal into a man, from a savage into a citizen. Perhaps, if his digestion is good, he is transformed from a simpleton to a sage. Education is the perfecting of life—the enrichment of the individual by the heritage of the race.

Vicious when one is in perfect health. I should make education in health a required course in every year of schooling from kindergarten to PhD.

We have no word in our language to express for the once-weaker sex those qualities which in the male are now connoted by the word gentleman; lady brings to mind some haughty and bejeweled duchess rather than the simple and understanding kindliness of a woman who has borne children and loved them.

The Industrial Revolution, by drawing sons and daughters into independent employment, deprived parental authority of its economic base.

So the family, which for thousands of years served as the fount and bastion of disciplined character and social order, lost its economic functions and its moral force.

Some patients with allergies and moderate to severe asthma cannot control their condition with steroids. A drug called Xolair® might be the answer. This allergy medicine works to block the antibodies that react with allergens, thus preventing an allergic reaction. A doctor needs to inject Xolair® into the patient once or twice a month. This is a long-term medicine, not for quick relief. Patients who take it usually have fewer asthma attacks and need less medication to control their asthma symptoms.


# Themes in World History [class-11] (NCERT)

In Britain, for instance, coal and cotton textile industries were developed in the first phase of industrialisation, while the invention of railways initiated the second stage of that process. In other countries such as Russia, which began to industrialise much later (from the late nineteenth century onwards), the railway and other heavy industry emerged in the initial phase of industrialisation itself.

Many of the valedictorians admitted to not being the smartest kid in class, just the hardest worker.

Others said that it was more an issue of giving teachers what they wanted than actually knowing the material better. Most of the subjects in the study were classified as “careerists”: they saw their job as getting good grades, not really as learning.

“They’re extremely well rounded and successful, personally and professionally, but they’ve never been devoted to a single area in which they put all their passion. That is not usually a recipe for eminence.”.

What if I told you your son’s upper body would be too long, his legs too short, his hands and feet too big, and he’d have gangly arms? I doubt you’d jump for joy. None of those things sounds objectively “good.” But when a knowledgeable swim coach hears those things, he sees nothing but Olympic Gold.

Is Phelps physically perfect? Far from it. He doesn’t dance well. Or even run well. In fact, he doesn’t seem designed to move on land at all. But Mark Levine and Michael Sokolove both wrote pieces for the New York Times describing Phelps’s collection of odd traits as making him uniquely suited to being an awesome swimmer. Yes, he’s strong and lean, but for a six-foot-four-inch man he’s not normally proportioned. His legs are short and his trunk long – making him more like a canoe. He has disproportionately big hands and feet—better “flippers.” If you extend your arms out in either direction, the distance between your fingertips should match your height. Not for Phelps. His wingspan is six feet seven inches. Longer arms mean more powerful strokes in the pool.

So it’s no surprise that creativity is inversely correlated with employee performance reviews.

Research by Sonja Lyubomirsky shows that people are happier and less stressed when they “chunk” their efforts to help others versus a relentless “sprinkling.” So by doing all their good deeds one day a week, Givers make sure assisting others doesn’t hamper their own achievements. One hundred hours.

Depressed people are more accurate than optimists. It’s called “depressive realism.” The world can be a harsh place. Optimists lie to themselves. But if we all stop believing anything can change, nothing ever will. We need a bit of fantasy to keep us going.

“What is to give light must endure burning.”.

It’s the stories we tell ourselves that keep us going. They can be a higher truth. Or, in many cases, they don’t need to be true at all.

This is why lawyers are 3.6 times more likely to be depressed than people in other professions. To protect their clients, attorneys must consider every possible thing that can go wrong. They can’t tell themselves happy, less accurate stories about how a deal will unfold. Pessimists outperform optimists in law school. And this same quality makes them very unhappy. Law is the highest paid profession in the United States and yet, when surveyed, 52 percent of lawyers described themselves as dissatisfied with their jobs. You can guess what effects this has on grit: the legal profession has high attrition rates. To quote Liz Brown, “Law is the only career I know that has a sub-profession dedicated to helping people get out of it.”.

Research shows that the most motivating thing is progress in meaningful work.

“The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.”.

I hope you will not think me presumptuous or rude if I say that one of the secrets of productivity . . . is to have a very big waste paper basket to take care of all invitations such as yours.

The more extroverted you are, the worse you are at your job.

As we saw, having lots of friends has clear benefits . . . but can also be an enormous distraction.

It is better to give than to receive. Look for opportunities to do something for the other person, such as sharing knowledge or offering an introduction to someone that person might not know but would be interested in knowing. Do not be transactional about networking. Do not offer something because you want something in return. Instead, show a genuine interest in something you and.

In fact, research shows we’d rather work with a kind fool than a competent jerk when given the option.

Asking for advice, however, can really help others warm to you.

Also, University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo found that when we leverage Facebook to set up face-to-face meetings, it boosts our happiness. When we use it as a substitute, however, it increases loneliness.

Never ask a mentor a question Google can easily answer for you. Carve this in stone. Scrawl it in blood above your desk. Get a tattoo of it. You can learn the basics of any subject on Khan Academy. And you should have already done all that work. Asking.

And you should have already done all that work. Asking your mentor a question is like a power up in a video game. Don’t waste them. Use them when they’ll really count.

Listening to other people’s ideas increases brainpower.

One study showed that social interactions can actually make us smarter. But there’s a catch: to get the cognitive boost, you need to take the other person’s perspective. And you can’t do that if you’re not paying attention.

“Who is the only person in your life who is available 24/7 to provide you with care and kindness? You.”.

Everyone will tell you how hard it is to write a book but most don’t mention how lonely it is. I could not have done it without these fine people:.

“The only place where success comes before work is a dictionary.”.

“Those individuals with the highest total output will, on average, produce the most acclaimed contributions as well.”.

“Those who stayed very involved in meaningful careers and worked the hardest, lived the longest.” Meaningful work means doing something that’s (a) important to you and (b) something you’re good at. Plenty of research shows that if you do those things you’re uniquely good at (psychologists call them “signature strengths”), they’re some of the biggest happiness-boosting activities of all. A Gallup study reported, “The more hours per day Americans get to use their strengths to do what they do best, the less likely they are to report experiencing worry, stress, anger, sadness, or physical pain.” Imagine what life would be like if your job entailed using your signature strengths all day, every day. Of course you’d work long hours. Who’d want to go home?.

“Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.”.

(Not bad for a guy who was rejected for military service because he had sweaty feet.).

Einstein said, “I treat my wife as an employee whom I cannot fire.”.

“The true artist will let his wife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his art.”.

“One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers is that they’re not having good relationships. They’re busy making money and attending to themselves and that means there’s less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count.”.

To think about this another way, do you accomplish more in three hours when you’re sleep deprived or in one hour when you feel energetic, optimistic, and engaged?.

We love having choices. We hate making choices. Having choices means having possibilities. Making choices means losing possibilities. And having so many choices increases the chance of regret. When work is always a choice, everything is a trade-off. More time working means less time with your friends, spouse, or kids. And if you choose wrong, it’s your fault, making choices even more stressful.

First I’ll work a job I hate and make a lot of money and then I’ll have a family and then I’ll.

First I’ll work a job I hate and make a lot of money and then I’ll have a family and then I’ll do what I want and be happy.

Most of us use our calendars all wrong: we don’t schedule work; we schedule interruptions. Meetings get scheduled. Phone calls get scheduled. Doctor appointments get scheduled. You know what often doesn’t get scheduled? Real work. All those other things are distractions. Often, they’re other people’s work. But they get dedicated blocks of time and your real work becomes an orphan. If real work is the stuff that affects the bottom line, the stuff that gets you noticed, the thing that earns you raises and gets you singled out for promotion, well, let me utter blasphemy and suggest that maybe it deserves a little dedicated time too.

“The only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”.

# The Forty Rules of Love: A Novel of Rumi (Elif Shafak)

For despite what some people say, love is not only a sweet feeling bound to come and quickly go away.

In many ways the twenty-first century is not that different from the thirteenth century. Both will be recorded in history as times of unprecedented religious clashes, cultural misunderstandings, and a general sense of insecurity and fear of the Other. At times like these, the need for love is greater than ever.

Because love is the very essence and purpose of life. As Rumi reminds us, it hits everybody, including those who shun love—even those who use the word “romantic” as a sign of disapproval.

“How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.”.

Let Him know that when He abandons his lambs, they won’t meekly wait to be slaughtered. They will turn into wolves.”.

The water that scares you rejuvenates me. For unlike you I can swim, and swim I shall.

Having roots nowhere, I have everywhere to go.

The Path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide!.

The Path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart. Knowing your ego will lead you to the knowledge of God.

No matter who we are or where we live, deep inside we all feel incomplete. It’s like we have lost something and need to get it back. Just what that something is, most of us never find out. And of those who do, even fewer manage to go out and look for it.

“But let us not forget that cities are like human beings. They are born, they go through childhood and adolescence, they grow old, and eventually they die. At this moment in time, Baghdad is in its late youth.

“Because although it is a fact that He cannot be found by seeking, only those who seek can find Him.”.

“There are people who have never traveled anywhere and yet have seen the world.”.

“When something needs to be said, I’ll say it even if the whole world grabs me by the neck and tells me to keep quiet.”.

“The sharia is like a candle,” said Shams of Tabriz. “It provides us with much valuable light. But let us not forget that a candle helps us to go from one place to another in the dark. If we forget where we are headed and instead concentrate on the candle, what good is it?”.

“Scholars who focus on the sharia know the outer meaning. Sufis know the inner meaning. Saints know the inner of the inner. And as for the fourth level, that is known.

“Scholars who focus on the sharia know the outer meaning. Sufis know the inner meaning. Saints know the inner of the inner. And as for the fourth level, that is known only by prophets and those closest to God.”.

“Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Qur’an on a different level in tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batm—the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.” With glinting eyes Shams continued. “Scholars who focus on the sharia know the outer meaning. Sufis know the inner meaning. Saints know the inner of the inner. And as for the fourth level, that is known only by prophets and those closest to God.”.

“So you see, don’t judge the way other people connect to God,” concluded Shams. “To each his own way and his own prayer. God does not take us at our word. He looks deep into our hearts. It is not the ceremonies or rituals that make a difference, but whether our hearts are sufficiently pure or not.”.

Seized by the terror of being abandoned by her husband and daughter, she opened the fridge and looked through it for a few minutes. The desire to scoop out some cherry vanilla ice cream warred with the fear of gaining weight. With no small effort, she took a step away from the fridge and slammed the door, a bit more harshly than necessary.

One thing that has helped me personally in the past was to stop interfering with the people around me and getting frustrated when I couldn’t change them.

May love find you when you least expect, where you least expect.

“One of the rules says, You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.

Loneliness and solitude are two different things. When you are lonely, it is easy to delude yourself into believing that you are on the right path. Solitude is better for us, as it means being alone without feeling lonely. But eventually it is best to find a person, the person who will be your mirror. Remember, only in another person’s heart can you truly see yourself and the presence of God within you.

Whatever happens in your life, no matter how troubling things might seem, do not enter the neighborhood of despair. Even when all doors remain closed, God will open up a new path only for you. Be thankful! It is easy to be thankful when all is well. A Sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that he has been denied.

Patience does not mean to passively endure. It means to be farsighted enough to trust the end result of a process. What does patience mean? It means to look at the thorn and see the rose, to look at the night and see the dawn. Impatience means to be so shortsighted as to not be able to see the outcome. The lovers of God never run out of patience, for they know that time is needed for the crescent moon to become full.

I have grown fond of Shams. It pained me to know that I was sending him on a dangerous journey.

East, west, south, or north makes little difference. No matter what your destination, just be sure to make every journey a journey within. If you travel within, you’ll travel the whole wide world and beyond.

As a Sufi, I had been trained to accept the thorn with the rose, the difficulties with the beauties of life.

The midwife knows that when there is no pain, the way for the baby cannot be opened and the mother cannot give birth. Likewise, for a new Self to be born, hardship is necessary. Just as clay needs to go through intense heat to become strong, Love can only be perfected in pain.

The quest for Love changes us. There is no seeker among those who search for Love who has not matured on the way. The moment you start looking for Love, you start to change within and without.”.

There are more fake gurus and false teachers in this world than the number of stars in the visible universe. Don’t confuse power-driven, self-centered people with true mentors. A genuine spiritual master will not direct your attention to himself or herself and will not expect absolute obedience or utter admiration from you, but instead will help you to appreciate and admire your inner self. True mentors are as transparent as glass. They let the Light of God pass through them.”.

Because you are so desperate to win the approval of others, you’ll never get rid of their criticisms, no matter how hard you try.”.

Beholden to the peasant who dropped me off at the town center, I found myself and my horse a place to stay. The Inn of Sugar Vendors seemed just what I needed. Of the four rooms I was shown, I chose the one with the fewest possessions, which consisted of a.

Beholden to the peasant who dropped me off at the town center, I found myself and my horse a place to stay. The Inn of Sugar Vendors seemed just what I needed. Of the four rooms I was shown, I chose the one with the fewest possessions, which consisted of a sleeping mat with a moldy blanket, an oil lamp that was sputtering its last, a sun-dried brick that I could use as a pillow, and a good view of the whole town up to the base of the surrounding hills.

I kept wondering, is the way I’ve lived my life the way I want to continue from now on?.

There are no wrinkles or gray hair strong enough to defy the power of forty!.

“God created suffering so that joy might appear through its opposite,” Rumi said. “Things become manifest through opposites. Since God has no opposite, He remains hidden.”.

“Fret not where the road will take you. Instead concentrate on the first step. That’s the hardest part and that’s what you are responsible for. Once you take that step let everything do what it naturally does and the rest will follow. Do not go with the flow. Be the flow.”.

He wrote about other things, deeper things, like life and death, and above all love.

Aziz was that rare type of man a woman could love without losing her self-respect.

So maybe it was blasphemy for a married woman with children to write intimate e-mails to a stranger, but given the platonic nature of their relationship, Ella deduced, it was sweet blasphemy.

“Yes, but I know myself, and believe me, it would have been much worse if it were the other way round.”.

“Yes, but I know myself, and believe me, it would have been much worse if it were the other way round.” As long as I knew myself, I would be all right. Whosoever knows himself, knows the One.

Life is a temporary loan, and this world is nothing but a sketchy imitation of Reality. Only children would mistake a toy for the real thing. And yet human beings either become infatuated with the toy or disrespectfully break it and throw it aside. In this life stay away from all kinds of extremities, for they will destroy your inner balance.

And yet human beings either become infatuated with the toy or disrespectfully break it and throw it aside. In this life stay away from all kinds of extremities, for they will destroy your inner balance. Sufis do not go to extremes. A Sufi always remains mild and moderate. Tomorrow morning I will go to the big mosque and listen to Rumi. He can be as great a preacher as everyone says, but in the end the breadth and scope of every speaker are determined by those of his audience. Rumi’s words might be like a wild garden, full of teasels, herbs, spruces, and shrubs, but it is always up to the visitor to pick his fancy. While pretty flowers are instantly plucked, few people pay attention to plants with thorns and prickles. But the truth is, great medicines are often made from these. Isn’t it the same with the garden of love? How can love be worthy of its name if one selects solely the pretty things and leaves out the hardships? It is easy to enjoy the good and dislike the bad. Anybody can do that. The real challenge is to love the good and the bad together, not because you need to take the rough with the smooth but because you need to go beyond such.

While pretty flowers are instantly plucked, few people pay attention to plants with thorns and prickles.

“I am a Sufi, the child of the present moment.”.

And the hardest thing for a Christian converting to.

And the hardest thing for a Christian converting to Islam is said to be letting go of the Trinity.

Muslim scholars criticize Christianity for accepting the Trinity, and Christian scholars criticize Islam for seeing the Qur’an as a perfect book. They make it sound as if the two religions are a world apart. But if you ask me, when it comes to the basics, ordinary Christians and ordinary Muslims have more in common with each other than with their own scholars.

Pity the fool who thinks the boundaries of his mortal mind are the boundaries of God the Almighty. Pity the ignorant who assume they can negotiate and settle debts with God. Do such people think God is a grocer who attempts to weigh our virtues and our wrongdoings on two separate scales? Is He a clerk meticulously writing down our sins in His accounting book so as to make us pay Him back someday? Is this their notion of Oneness?.

Neither a grocer nor a clerk, my God is a magnificent God. A living God! Why would I want a dead God? Alive He is. His name is al-Hayy—the Ever-Living. Why would I wallow in endless fears and anxieties, always restricted by prohibitions and limitations? Infinitely compassionate He is. The name is al-Wadud. All-Praiseworthy He is. I praise Him with all my words and deeds, as naturally and effortlessly as I breathe. The name is al-Hamid. How can I ever spread gossip and slander if I know deep down in my heart that God hears and sees it all? His name is al-Başir. Beautiful beyond all dreams and hopes.

Every time we fall in love, we ascend to heaven. Every time we hate, envy, or fight someone, we tumble straight into the fires of hell.

Sufis love God simply because they love Him, pure and easy, untainted and nonnegotiable.

Love is the reason. Love is the goal. And when you love God so much, when you love each and every one of His creations because of Him and thanks to Him, extraneous categories melt into thin air. From that point on, there can be no “I” anymore. All you amount to is a zero so big it covers your whole being.

“Not Christian or Jew or Muslim, not Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi or zen. Not any religion or cultural system. I am not of the East, nor of the West.… My place is placeless, a trace of the traceless.”.

Wars might be present since time immemorial, at least since Cain killed his brother Abel,.

Bountiful is your life, full and complete. Or so you think, until someone comes along and makes you realize what you have been missing all this time.

Bountiful is your life, full and complete. Or so you think, until someone comes along and makes you realize what you have been missing all this time. Like a mirror that reflects what is absent rather than present, he shows you the void in your soul—the void you have resisted seeing. That person can be a lover, a friend, or a spiritual master.

Like a mirror that reflects what is absent rather than present, he shows you the void in your soul—the void you have resisted seeing. That person can be a lover, a friend, or a spiritual master. Sometimes it can be a child to look after. What matters is to find the soul that will complete yours.

It’s as if for years on end you compile a personal dictionary. In it you give your definition of every concept that matters to you, such as “truth,” “happiness,” or “beauty.” At every major turning point in life, you refer to this dictionary, hardly ever feeling the need to question its premises. Then one day a stranger comes and snatches your precious dictionary and throws it away.

This is what Shams has done to me. Our friendship has taught me so much. But more than that, he has taught me to unlearn everything I knew.

“The universe is one being. Everything and everyone is interconnected through an invisible web of stories. Whether we are aware of it or not, we are all in a silent conversation. Do no harm. Practice compassion. And do not gossip behind anyone’s back—not even a seemingly innocent remark! The words that come out of our mouths do not vanish but are perpetually stored in infinite space, and they will come back to us in due time. One man’s pain will hurt us all. One man’s joy will make everyone smile,” he murmured. “This is what one of the forty rules reminds us.” Then.

The past is an interpretation. The future is an illusion.

The past is an interpretation. The future is an illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, proceeding from the past to the future. Instead time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within the present moment.

“You see, the present moment is all there is and all that there ever will be. When you grasp this truth, you’ll have nothing to fear anymore. Then you can walk out of this brothel for good.”.

“Your destiny is the level where you will play your tune. You might not change your instrument but how well to play is entirely in your hands.”.

“In this world take pity on three kinds of people. The rich man who has lost his fortune, the well-respected man who has lost his respectability, and the wise man who is surrounded by ignorants.”.

The true Sufi is such that even when he is unjustly accused, attacked, and condemned from all sides, he patiently endures, uttering not a single bad word about any of his critics. A Sufi never apportions blame. How can there be opponents or rivals or even “others” when there.

On the Sufi path, first you discover the art of being alone amid the crowd. Next you discover the crowd within your.

On the Sufi path, first you discover the art of being alone amid the crowd. Next you discover the crowd within your solitude—the voices inside you.

I thanked God over and over again for giving me a true companion and prayed that his beautiful soul would never sober up from the drunkenness of Divine Love.

“Rumi says we don’t need to hunt for love outside ourselves. All we need to do is to eliminate the barriers inside that keep us away from love.”.

“The message is that the torment a person can inflict upon himself is endless. Hell is inside us, and so is heaven.

Little did I know that I was making the most common and the most painful mistake women have made all throughout the ages: to naïvely think that with their love they can change the men they love.

This world is erected upon the principle of reciprocity. Neither a drop of kindness nor a speck of evil will remain unreciprocated. Fear not the plots, deceptions, or tricks of other people. If somebody is setting a trap, remember, so is God. He is the biggest plotter. Not even a leaf stirs outside God’s knowledge. Simply and fully believe in that. Whatever God does, He does beautifully.”.

“God is a meticulous clockmaker. So precise is His order that everything on earth happens in its own time. Neither a minute late nor a minute early. And for everyone without exception, the clock works accurately. For each there is a time to love and a time to die.”.

“It is never too late to ask yourself, ‘Am I ready to change the life I am living? Am I ready to change within?’ “Even if a single day in your life is the same as the day before, it surely is a pity. At every moment and with each new breath, one should be renewed and renewed again. There is only one way to be born into a new life: to die before death.”.

While the parts change, the whole always remains the same. For every thief who departs this world, a new one is born. And every decent person who passes away is replaced by a new one. In this way not only does nothing remain the same but also nothing ever really changes. For every Sufi who dies, another is born somewhere.

“A life without love is of no account. Don’t ask yourself what kind of love you should seek, spiritual or material, divine or mundane, Eastern or Western.… Divisions only lead to more divisions. Love has no labels, no definitions. It is what it is, pure and simple. “Love is the water of life. And a lover is a soul of fire! “The universe turns differently when fire loves water.”.


# History of Medieval India (Satish Chandra)

It was the Chalukyan king, Pulakesin II, who had defeated Harsha and not allowed him to expand his kingdom towards the Deccan.

The founder of the Chola empire was Vijayalaya, who was at first a feudatory of the Pallavas.

Rajaraja destroyed the Chera navy at Trivandrum, and attacked Quilon. He then conquered Madurai and captured the Pandyan king. He also invaded Sri Lanka and annexed its northern part to his empire.

This expedition, which was led by a Chola general, took place in 1022 and followed in reverse the same route which the great conqueror Samudragupta had followed. To commemorate this occasion, Rajendra I assumed the title of Gangaikondachola (‘the Chola who conquered the Ganga’). He built a new capital near the mouth of the Kaveri river and called it Gangaikondacholapuram (‘the city of the Chola who conquered the Ganga’).

The basic unit of administration was the nadu which consisted of a number of villages having close kinship ties and other close associations.

In the Chola kingdom, nadus were grouped into valanadus.

In the Chola kingdom, nadus were grouped into valanadus. The Chola state was divided into four mandalams or provinces. Sometimes, princes of the royal family were appointed governors of provinces. Officials were generally paid by giving them assignments of revenue- bearing lands.

We hear of two assemblies, called the ur, and the sabha or mahasabha. The ur was a general assembly of the village. However, we know more about the working of the mahasabha. This was a gathering of the adult men in the Brahman villages which were called agraharams.

Temple architecture in the south attained its climax under the Cholas. The style of architecture which came into vogue during this period is called Dravida, because it was confined largely to south India.

The most magnificent of these is the Hoysalesvara temple. It is the best example of what is called the Chalukyan style.

Thus, life was closely integrated with religion. For the common man, the temples were not merely a place for worship but the hub of social and cultural life as well.

Another aspect was image-making which reached its zenith in the dancing figure of the Siva, called Nataraja. The Nataraja figures of this period, particularly those in bronze, are considered masterpieces. Many fine examples of this are to be found in museums in India and abroad.

The Rashtrakuta king, Amoghavarsha, wrote a book on poetics in Kannada. Many Jain scholars also contributed to the growth of Kannada. Pampa, Ponna and Ranna are regarded as the three gems of Kannada poetry.

While Mahmud played an important role in the defence of the Islamic states against the Turkish tribes and in the Iranian cultural renaissance, in India his memory is only that of a plunderer and a destroyer of temples.

The most important of these were the Gahadavalas of Kanauj, the Paramaras of Malwa, and the Chauhans of Ajmer.

The Rajput organisation of society had both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage was the sense of brotherhood and egalitarianism which prevailed among the Rajputs. But the same trait made it difficult to maintain discipline among them.

But their basic weakness was their tendency to form exclusive groups, each claiming superiority over the others. They were not prepared to extend the sense of brotherhood to non-Rajputs. This led to a growing gap between the Rajput ruling groups and the people most of whom were non-Rajputs. The Rajputs form only about ten per cent of the population in Rajasthan even today. The proportion of the Rajputs to the total population of the areas they dominated could not have been much higher during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

The ideal ruler was one who led out his armies after celebrating the Dussehra festival to invade the territories of his neighbours.

Recent research shows that the Turks did not have any superior weapons at their disposal as compared to the Indians.

The Turkish bows could shoot arrows to a longer distance, but the Indian bows were supposed to be more accurate and more deadly, the arrowheads being generally dipped in poison. In hand to hand combat the Indians swords were considered to be best in the world.

The weakness of the Indians were social and organizational. The growth of feudalism, i.e., rise of the local landed elements and chiefs had weakened the administrative structure and military organisation of the Indian states. The rulers had to depend more on the various chiefs who rarely acted in coordination, and quickly dispersed to their areas after battle. On the other hand, the tribal structure of the Turks, and the growth of the iqta and khalisa systems, enabled the Turks to maintain large standing armies which could be kept in the field for a long time.

The social and organizational structure of the Turks also gave them many advantages. The iqta system which grew slowly in West Asia, implied that a Turkish chief was allotted a piece of land as iqta from which he could collect the land revenues and taxes due to the state. In return, he had to maintain a body of troops for the service of the ruler. The grant was not hereditary, and was held at the pleasure of the sultan who could transfer him to any place. The sultan drew revenues directly from pieces of land Which were called khalisa. This enabled him to maintain a large standing army. While states rose and fell in West Asia as in India, in West Asia, unlike the Rajput states, in each state the armed forces were more highly centralized. Many of the Turkish officers were slaves, who had been trained for warfare, and grew in the Sultan’s service, and on whom the Sultan could place total trust.

His objects were two fold: first, to oust the Arabs as well as his European rivals, the Venetians, from the rich eastern trade, and second, to counterpoise the growing power of the Turks and Arabs by converting the ‘heathens’ of Africa and Asia to Christianity.

Babur’s advent into India was significant from many points of view. For the first time since the downfall of the Kushan empire, Kabul and Qandhar became integral parts of an empire comprising north India.

Babur’s advent into India was significant from many points of view. For the first time since the downfall of the Kushan empire, Kabul and Qandhar became integral parts of an empire comprising north India. Since these areas had always acted as staging places for an invasion of India, by dominating them Babur and his successors were able to give to India security from external invasions for almost 200 years.

Economically also, the control of Kabul and Qandhar strengthened India's foreign trade since these two towns were the starting points for caravans meant for China in the east, and the Mediterranean seaports in the west.

Babur introduced a new mode of warfare in India. Although gunpowder was known in India earlier, Babur showed what a skilled combination of artillery and cavalry could achieve.

Babur had the prestige of being a descendant of two of the most famous warriors of Asia, Changez and Timur. None of his nobles, could, therefore, claim a status of equality with him, or aspire to his throne. The challenge to his position, if any, could come only from a Timurid prince.

The fall of Chittor was followed by the conquest of Ranthambhor reputed to be the most powerful fortress in Rajasthan. Jodhpur had been conquered earlier. As a result of these victories, most of the Rajput rajas, including those of Bikaner and Jaisalmer, submitted to Akbar. Only Mewar continued to resist.

The Muslims believed that in every epoch a man from the family of the Prophet will make an appearance and will strengthen the religion, and make justice triumph. Such a person was called the Mahdi.

# Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Yuval Noah Harari)

On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers cuddling their babies and clutches of carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths chafing against the dictates of society and weary elders who just wanted to be left in peace; chest-thumping machos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old matriarchs who had already seen it all. These archaic humans loved, played, formed close friendships and competed for status and power – but so did chimpanzees, baboons and elephants. There was nothing special about them. Nobody, least of all humans themselves, had any inkling that their descendants would one day walk on the moon, split the atom, fathom the genetic code and write history books. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were insignificant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or jellyfish.

Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to change and develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’.

Money comes to money, and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education, and ignorance to ignorance.

Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. Money comes to money, and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education, and ignorance to ignorance.

Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?.

To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’, which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category.

Anyone who has read a novel by Charles Dickens knows that the liberal regimes of nineteenth-century Europe gave priority to individual freedom even if it meant throwing insolvent poor families in prison and giving orphans little choice but to join schools for pickpockets. Anyone who has read a novel by Alexander Solzhenitsyn knows how Communisms egalitarian ideal produced brutal tyrannies that tried to control every aspect of daily life.

Homo sapiens evolved to think of people as divided into us and them. ‘Us’ was the group immediately around you, whoever you were, and ‘them’ was everyone else.

‘Everyone would work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs’ turned out in practice into ‘everyone would work as little as they can get away with, and receive as much as they could grab’.

So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.

The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism.

Nothing in the Cairo marketplace.’ So why study history? Unlike physics or economics,.

So why study history? Unlike physics or economics, history is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine. For example, studying how Europeans came to dominate Africans enables us to realise that there is nothing natural or inevitable about the racial hierarchy, and that the world might well be arranged differently.

The nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer, upon seeing the explosion, quoted from the Bhagavadgita: ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’.

Mohenjo-daro was one of the chief cities of the Indus Valley civilisation, which flourished in the third millennium BC and was destroyed around 1900 BC. None of India’s pre-British rulers – neither the Mauryas, nor the Guptas, nor the Delhi sultans, nor the great Mughals – had given the ruins a second glance. But a British archaeological survey took notice of the site in 1922. A British team then excavated it, and discovered the first great civilisation of India, which no Indian had been aware of.

The European empires believed that in order to govern effectively they must know the languages and cultures of their subjects.

The European empires believed that in order to govern effectively they must know the languages and cultures of their subjects. British officers arriving in India were supposed to spend up to three years in a Calcutta college, where they studied Hindu and Muslim law alongside English law; Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian alongside Greek and Latin; and Tamil, Bengali and Hindustani culture alongside mathematics, economics and geography. The study of linguistics provided invaluable help in understanding the structure and grammar of local languages.

They noticed that the earliest Sanskrit speakers, who had invaded India from Central Asia more than 3,000 years ago, had called themselves Arya. The speakers of the earliest Persian language called themselves Airiia.

The contractor would eventually have $10 million in his account, even though the bank still has but $1 million in its vaults. Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes.

When a landlord, a weaver, or a shoemaker has greater profits than he needs to maintain his own family, he uses the surplus to employ more assistants, in order to further increase his profits. The more profits he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in the profits of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity.

Yet Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I benefit everybody, not just myself. Egoism is altruism.

Happiness all depend on economic growth. Ask a capitalist how to bring justice and political freedom to a place like Zimbabwe or Afghanistan, and you are likely to get a lecture on how economic affluence and a thriving middle class are essential for stable democratic institutions, and about the need therefore to inculcate Afghan tribesmen in the values of free enterprise, thrift and self-reliance.

Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important.

Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of economic or even physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid’s poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.

Prophets, poets and philosophers realised thousands of years ago that being satisfied with what you already have is far more important than getting more of what you want.

Rather, happiness consists in seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile.

As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.

As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction.

And the guests so exclaimed at how well he looked in his tux that an inexperienced observer might easily have thought the Don himself was the lucky groom.

“Why do they bother your father with business on a day like this?” Kay asked. Michael laughed again. “Because they know that by tradition no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter’s wedding day. And no Sicilian ever lets a chance like that go by.”.

A man who is not a father to his children can never be a real man.

“Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than government. It is almost the equal of family. Never forget that. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t have to ask me to help. Now tell me, why can’t you sing? You sang well in the garden. As well as Nino.”.

“Italians have a little joke, that the world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after him, and that’s why they have god-fathers. Since Johnny’s father died, Mr. Corleone feels his responsibility even more deeply. As for trying you again, Mr. Corleone is much too sensitive. He never asks a second favor where he has been refused the first.”.

“I think you should say yes,” Hagen said. “You know all the obvious reasons. But the most important one is this. There is more money potential in narcotics than in any other business. If we don’t get into it, somebody else will, maybe the Tattaglia Family. With the revenue they earn they can amass more and more police and political power. Their Family will become stronger than ours. Eventually they will come after us to take away what we have. It’s just like countries. If they arm, we have to arm. If they become stronger economically, they become a threat to us. Now we have the gambling and we have the unions and right now they are the best things to have. But I think narcotics is the coming thing. I think we have to have a piece of that action or we risk everything we have. Not now, but maybe ten years from now.”.

Must say no to you but I must give you my reasons. The profits in your business are huge but so are the risks. Your operation, if I were part of it, could damage my other interests. It’s true I have many, many friends in politics, but they would not be so friendly if my business were narcotics instead of gambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice, and they think narcotics a dirty business. No, don’t protest. I’m telling you their thoughts, not mine. How a man makes his living is not my concern. And what I am telling you is that this business of yours is too risky. All the members of my Family have lived well the last ten years, without danger, without harm. I can’t endanger them or their livelihoods out of greed.”.

“Santino, never let anyone outside the Family know what you are thinking. Never let them know what you have under your fingernails. I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. Stop it and pay attention to business. Now get out of my sight.”.

Clemenza and Tessio shifted uneasily in their chairs, infantry leaders who hear their general rave about storming an impregnable hill no matter what the cost.

And he piled up good deeds as a banker piles up securities.

He would have to be in all ways strict with his own guilt. To reproach himself would only add to the Don’s burden. To show his own grief would only sharpen the grief of the Don. To point out his own shortcomings as a wartime Consigliere would only make the Don reproach himself for his own bad judgment for picking such a man for such an important post.

He must, Hagen knew, tell the news, present his analysis of what must be done to rectify the situation and then keep silent. His reactions thereafter must be the reactions invited by his Don. If the Don wanted him to show guilt, he would show guilt; if the Don invited grief, he would lay bare his genuine sorrow.

It was then that Don Corleone gave the speech that would be long remembered, and that reaffirmed his position as the most far-seeing statesman among them, so full of common sense, so direct from the heart, and to the heart of the matter. In it he coined a phrase that was to become as famous in its way as Churchill’s Iron Curtain, though not public knowledge until more than ten years later.

Michael didn’t laugh. His voice sounded absentminded. “You know, when I came home I wasn’t that glad when I saw my family, my father, my mother, my sister Connie, and Tom. It was nice but I didn’t really give a damn. Then I came home tonight and saw you in the kitchen and I was glad. Is that what you mean by love?” “That’s close enough for me,” Kay said.

He was mortified when his icon, Frank Sinatra, screamed abuse at him in a crowded restaurant. Angered by the depiction of Johnny Fontane in Puzo’s book, Sinatra called Puzo a pimp and threatened to impair his health and that of his family. Suddenly, Puzo realized, his fictional cast of characters was coming to life around him.

# Story of Philosophy (Durant, Will)

Human knowledge had become too great for the human mind.

All that remained was the scientific specialist, who knew “more and more about less and less,” and the philosophical speculator, who knew less and less about more and more. The specialist put on blinders in order to shut out from his vision all the world but one little spot, to which he glued his nose. Perspective was lost. “Facts” replaced understanding; and knowledge, split into a thousand isolated fragments, no longer generated wisdom. Every science, and every branch of philosophy, developed a technical terminology intelligible only to its exclusive devotees; as men learned more about the world, they found themselves ever less capable of expressing to their educated fellow-men what it was that they had learned. The gap between life and knowledge grew wider and wider; those who governed could not understand those who thought, and those who wanted to know could not understand those who knew. In the midst of unprecedented learning popular ignorance flourished, and chose its exemplars to rule the great cities of the world; in the midst of sciences endowed and enthroned as never before, new religions were born every day, and old superstitions recaptured the ground they had lost. The common man found himself forced to choose between a scientific priesthood mumbling unintelligible pessimism, and a theological priesthood mumbling incredible hopes.

God knows there is no short-cut to knowledge; after forty years of seeking her one finds “Truth” still veiled, and what she shows of herself most disconcerting.

Those jealous ones who would guard their knowledge from the world have only themselves to blame if their exclusiveness and their barbarous terminology have led the world to seek in books, in lectures, and in adult education, the instruction which they themselves have failed to give.

Analysis belongs to science, and gives us knowledge; philosophy must provide a synthesis for wisdom.

“Life has meaning,” we feel with Browning—“to find its meaning is my meat and drink.”.

“life means for us constantly to transform into light and flame all that we are or meet with”;.

“one of those who don’t want millions, but an answer to their questions”;.

We want to understand; “life means for us constantly to transform into light and flame all that we are or meet with”;1 we are like Mitya in The Brothers Karamazov—“one of those who don’t want millions, but an answer to their questions”;.

“To be a philosopher,” said Thoreau, “is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.”.

“Seek ye first the good things of the mind,” Bacon admonishes us, “and the rest will either be supplied or its loss will not be felt.”2 Truth will not make us rich, but it will make us free.

Science seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problems not yet open to the methods of science—problems like good and evil, beauty and ugliness, order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethics or political philosophy); it is the front trench in the siege of truth.

Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethics or political philosophy); it is the front trench in the siege of truth. Science is the captured territory; and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and marvelous world. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed; but only because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passes on, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and unexplored.

Science is analytical description, philosophy is synthetic interpretation.

Science tells us how to heal and how to kill; it reduces the death rate in retail and then kills us wholesale in war; but only wisdom—desire coordinated in the light of all experience—can tell us when to heal and when to kill.

Science without philosophy, facts without perspective and valuation, cannot save us from havoc and despair. Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom.

Specifically, philosophy means and includes five fields of study and discourse: logic, esthetics, ethics, politics, and metaphysics.

Esthetics is the study of ideal form, or beauty; it is the philosophy of art.

Logic is the study of ideal method in thought and research: observation and introspection, deduction and induction, hypothesis and experiment, analysis and synthesis—such are the forms of human activity which logic tries to understand and guide; it is a dull study for most of us, and yet the great events in the history of thought are the improvements men have made in their methods of thinking and research.

Ethics is the study of ideal conduct; the highest knowledge, said Socrates, is the knowledge of good and evil, the knowledge of the wisdom of life.

Politics is the study of ideal social organization (it is not, as one might suppose, the art and science of capturing and keeping office); monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, socialism, anarchism, feminism—these are the dramatis personae of political philosophy.

And lastly, metaphysics (which gets into so much trouble because it is not, like the other forms of philosophy, an attempt to coordinate the real in the light of the ideal) is the study of the “ultimate reality” of all things: of the real and final nature of “matter” (ontology), of “mind” (philosophical psychology), and of the interrelation of “mind” and “matter” in the processes of perception and knowledge (epistemology).

“One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.”.

Philosophy begins when one learns to doubt—particularly to doubt one’s cherished beliefs, one’s dogmas and one’s axioms. Who knows how these cherished beliefs became certainties with us, and whether some secret wish did not furtively beget them, clothing desire in the dress of thought? There is no real philosophy until the mind turns round and examines itself. Gnothi seauton, said Socrates: Know thyself.

Some who suffered from this “Socratic method,” this demand for accurate definitions, and clear thinking, and exact analysis, objected that he asked more than he answered, and left men’s minds more confused than before. Nevertheless he bequeathed to philosophy two very definite answers to two of our most difficult problems—What is the meaning of virtue? and What is the best state?.

He was seventy years old now (399 B.C.); perhaps he thought it was time for him to die, and that he could never again die so usefully.

“I thank God,” he used to say, “that I was born Greek and not barbarian, freeman and not slave, man and not woman; but above all, that I was born in the age of Socrates.”.

For nothing is so difficult as definition, nor anything so severe a test and exercise of mental clarity and skill.

“Verily I laughed many a time over the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had lame paws.”.

“You know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question for equals in power; the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”.

He answers, because of greed and luxury. Men are not content with a simple life: they are acquisitive, ambitious, competitive, and jealous; they soon tire of what they have, and pine for what they have not; and they seldom desire anything unless it belongs to others. The result is the encroachment of one group upon the territory of another, the rivalry of groups for the resources of the soil, and then war. Trade and finance develop, and bring new class-divisions. “Any ordinary city is in fact two cities, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich, each at war with the other; and in either division there are smaller ones—you would make a great mistake if you treated them as single states”.

Every form of government tends to perish by excess of its basic principle.

Aristocracy ruins itself by limiting too narrowly the circle within which power is confined; oligarchy ruins itself by the incautious scramble for immediate wealth. In either case the end is revolution. When revolution comes it may seem to arise from little causes and petty whims; but though it may spring from slight occasions it is the precipitate result of grave and accumulated wrongs; when a body is weakened by neglected ills, the merest exposure may bring serious disease (556).

But even democracy ruins itself by excess—of democracy. Its basic principle is the equal right of all to hold office and determine public policy. This is at first glance a delightful arrangement; it becomes disastrous because the people are not properly equipped by education to select the best rulers and the wisest courses (588). “As to the people they have no understanding, and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them” (Protagoras, 317); to get a doctrine accepted or rejected it is only necessary to have it praised or ridiculed in a popular play (a hit, no doubt, at Aristophanes, whose comedies attacked almost every new idea). Mob-rule is a rough sea for the ship of state to ride; every wind of oratory stirs up the waters and deflects the course.

Mob-rule is a rough sea for the ship of state to ride; every wind of oratory stirs up the waters and deflects the course. The upshot of such a democracy is tyranny or autocracy; the crowd so loves flattery, it is so “hungry for honey,” that at last the wiliest and most unscrupulous flatterer, calling himself the “protector of the people” rises to supreme power (565). (Consider the history of Rome.).

Plato complains that whereas in simpler matters—like shoe-making—we think only a specially-trained person will serve our purpose, in politics we presume that every one who knows how to get votes knows how to administer a city or a state. When we are ill we call for a trained physician, whose degree is a guarantee of specific preparation and technical competence—we do not ask for the handsomest physician, or the most eloquent one; well then, when the whole state is ill should we not look for the service and guidance of the wisest and the best? To devise a method of barring incompetence and knavery from public office, and of selecting and preparing the best to rule for the common good—that is the problem of political philosophy.

Human behavior, says Plato, flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge.

Desire, appetite, impulse, instinct—these are one; emotion, spirit, ambition, courage—these are one; knowledge, thought, intellect, reason—these are one.

Knowledge has its seat in the head; it is the eye of desire, and can become the pilot of the soul.

These powers and qualities are all in all men, but in divers degrees. Some men are but the embodiment of.

Some men are but the embodiment of desire; restless and acquisitive souls, who are absorbed in material quests and quarrels, who burn with lust of luxuries and show, and who rate their gains always as naught compared with their ever-receding goals: these are the men who dominate and manipulate industry. But there are others who are temples of feeling and courage, who care not so much what they fight for, as for victory “in and for itself”; they are pugnacious rather than acquisitive; their pride is in power rather than in possession, their joy is on the battle-field rather than in the mart: these are the men who make the armies and navies of the world. And last are the few whose delight is in meditation and understanding; who yearn not for goods, nor for victory, but for knowledge; who leave both market and battle-field to lose themselves in the quiet clarity of secluded thought; whose will is a light rather than a fire, whose haven is not power but truth: these are the men of wisdom, who stand aside unused by the world.

Morality, said Jesus, is kindness to the weak; morality, said Nietzsche, is the bravery of the strong; morality, says Plato, is the effective harmony of the whole.

“If what you have seems insufficient to you,” said the Roman Stoic Seneca (d. 65 A.D.), “then, though you possess the world, you will yet be miserable.”.

If victory is quite impossible it should be scorned.

The secret of peace is not to make our achievements equal to our desires, but to lower.

The secret of peace is not to make our achievements equal to our desires, but to lower our desires to the level of our achievements.

Do not betray even to your friend too much of your real purposes and thoughts; in conversation, ask questions oftener than you express opinions; and when you speak, offer data and information rather than beliefs and judgments.

Only knowledge, then, is power and freedom; and the only permanent happiness is the pursuit of knowledge and the joy of understanding.

He had the northern hunger for truth rather than the southern lust for beauty; the artist in him was purely an architect, building a system of thought to perfect symmetry and form.

“He whose mind is fixed upon true being has no time to look down upon the little affairs of men, or to be filled with jealousy and enmity in the struggle against them; his eye is ever directed towards fixed and immutable principles, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he imitates, and to these he would, as far as he can, conform himself.”105 “That which is necessary,” says Nietzsche, “does not offend me. Amor fati”—love of fate—“is the core of my nature.”106 Or Keats:.

“Only philosophers should write history,” he said.38 “In all nations, history is disfigured by fable, till at last philosophy comes to enlighten man; and when it does finally arrive in the midst of this darkness, it finds the human mind so blinded by centuries of error, that it can hardly undeceive it; it finds ceremonies, facts and monuments, heaped up to prove lies.”.

# The Lessons of History (Will Durant)

“The present is the past rolled up for action, and the past is the present unrolled for understanding”.

Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law.

Co-operation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition; we co-operate in our group—our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation—in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.

Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically, as in England and America in the nineteenth century under laissez-faire. To check the growth of inequality, liberty must be sacrificed, as in Russia after 1917. Even when repressed, inequality grows; only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed, and the best that the amiable philosopher can hope for is an approximate equality of legal justice and educational opportunity.

History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin.

Probably every vice was once a virtue—i.e.,.

In every age men have been dishonest and governments have been corrupt; probably less now than generally before.

“the men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.”.

In strict usage of the term, democracy has existed only in modern times,.

The American Revolution was not only a revolt of colonials against a distant government; it was also an uprising of a native middle class against an imported aristocracy.

Democracy is the most difficult of all forms of government, since it requires the widest spread of intelligence, and we forgot to make ourselves intelligent when we made ourselves sovereign. Education has spread, but intelligence is perpetually retarded by the fertility of the simple. A cynic remarked that “you mustn’t enthrone ignorance just because there is so much of it.” However, ignorance is not long enthroned, for it lends itself to manipulation by the forces that mold public opinion. It may be true, as Lincoln supposed, that “you can’t fool all the people all the time,” but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.

In the last 3,421 years of recorded history only 268 have seen no war.

History repeats itself, but only in outline and in the large.

Tools.

Do you think these tools could have been used for harvesting?.

Yes you arre awesome.

According to Ricardian ideas, a landowner should have a claim only to the “average rent” that prevailed at a given time. When the land yielded more than this “average rent”, the landowner had a surplus that the state needed to tax. If tax was not levied, cultivators were likely to turn into rentiers, and their surplus income was unlikely to be productively invested in the improvement of the land.

The revenue system that was introduced in the Bombay Deccan came to be known as the ryotwari settlement. Unlike the Bengal system, the revenue was directly settled with the ryot. The average income from different types of soil was estimated, the revenue-paying capacity of the ryot was assessed and a proportion of it fixed as the share of the state. The lands were resurveyed every 30 years and the revenue rates increased. Therefore the revenue demand was no longer permanent.

In Jhansi, the rani was forced by the popular pressure around her to assume the leadership of the uprising.

“It would be impossible to ignore the fact,” remarked the judge, “that you are in a different category from any person I have ever tried or am likely to try. It would be impossible to ignore the fact that, in the eyes of millions of your countrymen, you are a great patriot and a leader. Even those who differ from you in politics look upon you as a man of high ideals and of even saintly life.”.

The craze is for what they call labour-saving machinery. Men go on “saving labour”, till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation. I want to save time and labour, not for a fraction of mankind, but for all; I want the concentration of wealth, not in the hands of few, but in the hands of all.

The march was widely covered by the European and American press. Second, it was the first nationalist activity in which women participated in large numbers. The socialist activist Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay had persuaded Gandhiji not to restrict the protests to men alone. Kamaladevi.

It was a bigoted American who had killed Lincoln for believing that human beings were equal regardless of their race or skin colour; and it was a bigoted Hindu who had killed Gandhiji for believing that friendship was possible, indeed necessary, between Indians of different faiths. In this respect, as Time wrote, “The world knew that it had, in a sense too deep, too simple for the world to understand, connived at his (Gandhiji’s) death as it had connived at Lincoln’s.”.

If I had to make a list of things I wanted to see right now, old friends who would pity, judge, and gossip about me would be the last things on it. I didn’t want anyone else thinking the things I was thinking. I didn’t want anyone else privy to the specific horrors of my new situation. I did not want to be the topic of anyone’s phone chats, or get-togethers, or status updates. I didn’t want to be the reason other people counted their blessings.

# The Story of Civilization Volume I: Our Oriental Heritage (Will Durant)

“Were I to await perfection, my book would never be finished.”.

“I want to know what were the steps by which men passed from barbarism to civilization.”.

CIVILIZATION is social order promoting cultural creation.

Civilization begins in the peasant’s hut, but it comes to flower only in the towns.

It is not the great race that makes the civilization, it is the great civilization that makes the people; circumstances geographical and economic create a culture, and the culture creates a type.

It is impossible to be scientific here; for in calling other human beings “savage” or “barbarous” we may be expressing no objective fact, but only our fierce fondness for ourselves, and our timid shyness in the presence of alien ways.

Primitive peoples are ravenously fond of meat, even when they live mainly on cereals, vegetables and milk.

He does not love society so much as he fears solitude.

In his heart he is a solitary individual, pitted heroically against the world.

Property was the mother, war was the father, of the state.

Every state begins in compulsion; but the habits of obedience become the content of conscience, and soon every citizen thrills with loyalty to the flag.

Domination succeeds best where it binds diverse natural groups into an advantageous unity of order and trade.

Men decided that it was better to pay taxes than to fight among themselves; better to pay tribute to one magnificent robber than to bribe them all.

Even in classical civilization the brother was dearer than the husband: it was her brother, not her husband, that the wife of Intaphernes saved from the wrath of Darius; it was for her brother, not for her husband, that Antigone sacrificed herself.

Marriage began as a form of the law of property, as a part of the institution of slavery.

Wherever, in the history of civilization, woman has ceased to be an economic asset in marriage, marriage has decayed; and sometimes civilization has decayed with.

Wherever, in the history of civilization, woman has ceased to be an economic asset in marriage, marriage has decayed; and sometimes civilization has decayed with it.

As Beaumarchais put it, man differs from the animal in eating without being hungry, drinking without being thirsty, and making love at all seasons.

Every vice was once a virtue, necessary in the struggle for existence; it became a vice only when it survived the conditions that made it indispensable; a vice, therefore, is not an advanced form of behavior, but usually an atavistic throwback to ancient and superseded ways.

Damara natives would not exchange two sheep for four sticks, but willingly exchanged, twice in succession, one sheep for two sticks.

When—apparently after some time—the idea of twelve was reached, the number became a favorite because it was so pleasantly divisible by five of the first six digits; and that duodecimal system was born which obstinately survives in English measurements today: twelve months in a year, twelve pence in a shilling, twelve units in a dozen, twelve dozen in a gross, twelve inches in a foot.

Art is the creation of beauty; it is the expression of thought or feeling in a form that seems beautiful or sublime, and therefore arouses in us some reverberation of that primordial delight which woman gives to man, or man to woman. The thought may be any capture of life’s significance, the feeling may be any arousal or release of life’s tensions. The form may satisfy us through rhythm, which falls in pleasantly with the alternations of our breath, the pulsation of our blood, and the majestic oscillations of winter and summer, ebb and flow, night and day; or the form may please us through symmetry, which is a static rhythm, standing for strength and recalling to us the ordered proportions of plants and animals, of women and men; or it may please us through color, which brightens the spirit or intensifies life; or finally the form may please us through veracity—because its lucid and transparent imitation of nature or reality catches some mortal loveliness of plant or animal, or some transient meaning of circumstance, and holds it still for our lingering enjoyment or leisurely understanding. From these many sources come those noble superfluities of life—song and dance, music and drama, pottery and painting, sculpture and architecture, literature and philosophy. For what is philosophy but an art—one more attempt to give “significant form” to the chaos of experience?.

Object may be the desired mate; and then the esthetic—beauty-feeling—sense takes on the intensity and creativeness of sex, and spreads the aura of beauty to everything that concerns the beloved one—to all forms that resemble her, all colors that adorn her, please her or speak of her, all ornaments and garments that become her, all shapes and motions that recall her symmetry and grace. Or the pleasing form may be a desired male; and out of the attraction that here draws frailty to worship strength comes that sense of sublimity—satisfaction in the presence of power—which creates the loftiest art of all. Finally nature herself—with our cooperation—may become both sublime and beautiful; not only because it simulates and suggests all the tenderness of women and all the strength of men, but because we project into it our own feelings and fortunes, our love of others and of ourselves—relishing in it the scenes of our youth, enjoying its quiet solitude as an escape from the storm of life, living with it through its almost human seasons of green youth, hot maturity, “mellow fruitfulness” and cold decay, and recognizing it vaguely as the mother that lent us life and will receive us in our death. Art.

BUT we have spoken loosely; these primitive cultures that we have sketched as a means of studying the elements of civilization were not necessarily the ancestors of our own; for all that we know they may be the degenerate remnants of higher cultures that decayed when human leadership moved in the wake of the receding ice from the tropics to the north temperate zone. We have tried to understand how civilization in general arises and takes form; we have still to trace the prehistoricI origins of our own particular civilization.

From such remains we attempt to patch together some picture of the New Stone Age, we find at once a startling innovation—agriculture. In one sense all human history hinges upon two revolutions: the neolithic passage from hunting to agriculture, and the modern passage from agriculture to industry; no other revolutions have been.

The “Aryans” did not establish civilization—they took it from Babylonia and Egypt.

Since the stability of a society may be partly measured by inverse relation with the rate of interest, we may suspect that Sumerian business, like ours, lived in an atmosphere of economic and political uncertainty and doubt.

# Economics: The User's Guide: A Pelican Introduction (Pelican Books) (Ha-Joon Chang)

Smith starts his book by arguing that the ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity through greater division of labour, which refers to the division of production processes into smaller, specialized parts. He argued that this increases productivity in three ways. First, by repeating the same one or two tasks, workers become good at what they do more quickly (‘practice makes perfect’). Second, by specializing, workers do not have to spend time moving – physically and mentally – between different tasks (reduction in ‘transition costs’). Last, but not least, a finer breakdown of the process makes each step easier to be automated and thus be performed at superhuman speed (mechanization).


# The Intelligent Investor, Rev. Ed (Graham, Benjamin;Jason Zweig;Warren E. Buffett)

“something foolish, something creative and something generous.”.

I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner or later, all bull markets must end badly.

A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price. The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.

“Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”.

The one principle that applies to nearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell because it has declined.

This was that leading common stocks could be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high levels.

For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.

(“The fault, dear investor, is not in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves….”).

The habit of relating what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment.

Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons: how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses; how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains; how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential.

Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900% just to get back to where you started.

It simply means being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to harness your emotions and think for yourself.

“is a trait more of the character than of the brain.”.

In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer scientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than $2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market would return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming more and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.

They ignored Graham’s warning that “the really dreadful losses” always occur after “the buyer forgot to ask ‘How much?’”.

“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”.

While it seems easy to foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By the time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.

The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky, not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices fall.

The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale.

“An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”.

Operates on margin † should recognize that he is ipso.

We have already defined the defensive investor as one interested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother.

The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such a list.).

The first is the purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an alternative.

The first is the purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio.

If his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized investment-counsel firm.

The third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.

This usually means buying stocks when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has turned downward.

A small number of professionals frequently engage in short selling. Here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the established mechanism of the stock exchanges. Their object is to benefit from a subsequent decline in the price of these issues, by buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for.

This means buying stocks of companies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings, or for which some other favorable development is anticipated.

Here the usual emphasis is on an excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to continue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose companies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are expected to establish a high earning power later. (Such.

Here the usual emphasis is on an excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to continue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose companies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are expected to establish a high earning power later.

Stock trading is not an operation “which, on thorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory return.”.

In the area of near-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are generally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to the extent they are predictable, are already being carefully considered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of this year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for next year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for the same reason.

How many enterprising investors could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the professional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term future earnings?.

To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.

Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice.

Thus it seems that any intelligent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable picnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness.

But somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neglected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves a protracted and patience-trying experience.

Speculation is always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead of the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the market has gone up and profits are rolling in. (That’s the time to think of taking money out of your speculative fund.) Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account, nor in any part of your thinking.

It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study, and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead of profits.

As for children, he was blessed with as many as a hand has fingers, three sons and two daughters, each of whom he loved dearly.

If I had been a less discreet employee, I would have told them that Suleiman Wahdati was a mystifying creature to me, a man seemingly satisfied with living the rest of his days off the wealth of his inheritance, a man with no profession, no apparent passion, and apparently no impulse to leave behind something of himself in this world. I would have told them that he lived a life lacking in purpose or direction. Like those aimless rides I took him on. A life lived from the backseat, observed as it blurred by. An indifferent life.

Though a chauffeur’s job is to drive, he actually spends most of his time waiting.

# On Writing (Stephen King)

We are writers, and we never ask one another where we get our ideas; we know we don’t know.

Put another way, to write is human, to edit is divine.

Don’t bother trying to read between the lines, and don’t look for a through-line. There are no lines—only snapshots, most out of focus.

Imitation preceded creation; I would copy Combat Casey comics word for word in my Blue Horse tablet, sometimes adding my own.

Imitation preceded creation; I would copy Combat Casey comics word for word in my Blue Horse tablet, sometimes adding my own descriptions where they seemed appropriate.

There were more doors than one person could ever open in a lifetime, I thought (and still think).

She said it was good enough to be in a book. Nothing anyone has said to me since has made me feel any happier.

By then I was in the second grade and stone in love with the pretty teenage girl who lived next door. She never looked twice at me in the daytime, but at night, as I lay in bed and drifted toward sleep, we ran away from the cruel world of reality again and again.

Since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty.

I have spent a good many years since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that’s all. I’m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.

“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.”.

Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.

We had two kids by the time we’d been married three years. They were neither planned nor unplanned; they came when they came, and we were glad to have them.

And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or a husband), I smile and think, There’s someone who knows. Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don’t have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough.

It doesn’t matter if you’re James Jones, John Cheever, or a stewbum snoozing in Penn Station; for an addict, the right to the drink or drug of choice must be preserved at all costs. Hemingway and Fitzgerald didn’t drink because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak. They drank because it’s what alkies are wired up to do. Creative people probably do run a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what? We all look pretty much the same when we’re puking in the gutter.

It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around.

So I read where I can, but I have a favorite place and probably you do, too—a place where the light is good and the vibe is usually strong. For me it’s the blue chair in my study. For you it might be the couch on the sunporch, the rocker in the kitchen, or maybe it’s propped up in your bed—reading in bed can be heaven, assuming you can get just the right amount of light on the page and aren’t prone to spilling your coffee or cognac on the sheets.

“I didn’t know what else I might find to do once I got out here, did I? It’s best to have your tools with you. If you don’t, you’re apt to find something you didn’t expect and get discouraged.”.

I asked him why he’d lugged Fazza’s toolbox all the way around the house, if all he’d needed was that one screwdriver. He could have carried a screwdriver in the back pocket of his khakis.

Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold.

Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and don’t make any conscious effort to improve it.

One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones.

One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed. Make yourself a solemn promise right now that you’ll never use “emolument” when you mean “tip” and you’ll never say John stopped long enough to perform an act of excretion when you mean John stopped long enough to take a shit. If you believe “take a shit” would be considered offensive or inappropriate by your audience, feel free to say John stopped long enough to move his bowels (or perhaps John stopped long enough to “push”). I’m not trying to get you to talk dirty, only plain and direct. Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word—of course you will, there’s always another word—but it probably won’t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.

The timid fellow writes The meeting will be held at seven o’clock because that somehow says to him, “Put it this way and people will believe you really know.” Purge this quisling thought!

Believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops.

I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. If one is writing for one’s own pleasure, that fear may be mild—timidity is the word I’ve used here. If, however, one is working under deadline—a school paper, a newspaper article, the SAT writing sample—that fear may be intense.

All I ask is that you do as well as you can, and remember that, while to write adverbs is human, to write he said or she said is divine.

Ending with ideas about where it’s best to place the most important parts of a sentence. They say at the end, and everyone’s entitled to his/her opinion, but I don’t believe With a hammer he killed Frank will ever replace He killed Frank with a hammer.).

Writing is seduction. Good talk is part of seduction. If not so, why do so many couples who start the evening at dinner wind up in bed?.

If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.

I’m a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I don’t read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read. It’s what I do at night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I don’t read fiction to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones.

Almost everyone can remember losing his or her virginity, and most writers can remember the first book he/she put down thinking: I can do better than this. Hell, I am doing better than this!.

Reading at meals is considered rude in polite society, but if you expect to succeed as a writer, rudeness should be the second-to-least of your concerns. The least of all should be polite society and what it expects. If you intend to write as truthfully as you can, your days as a member of polite society are numbered, anyway.

Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening (or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. Perhaps even ecstatic. That goes for reading and writing as well as for playing a musical instrument, hitting a baseball, or running the four-forty. The sort of strenuous reading and writing program I advocate—four to six hours a day, every day—will not seem strenuous if you really enjoy doing these things and have an aptitude for them; in fact, you may be following such a program already. If you feel you need permission to do all the reading and writing your little heart desires, however, consider it hereby granted by yours truly.

For me, not working is the real work.

For me, not working is the real work. When I’m writing, it’s all the playground, and the worst three hours I ever spent there were still pretty damned good.

Door. It surrounds me, keeps the mundane world out. When you write, you want to get rid of the world, do you not? Of course you do. When you’re writing, you’re creating your own worlds.

When you write, you want to get rid of the world, do you not? Of course you do. When you’re writing, you’re creating your own worlds.

Gambolled all the way to the ceiling. The air was redolent.

Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.

Kurt Vonnegut, for example, rewrote each page of his novels until he got them exactly the way he wanted them.

Someone—I can’t remember who, for the life of me— once wrote that all novels are really letters aimed at one person. As it happens, I believe this. I think that every novelist has a single ideal reader; that at various points during the composition of a story, the writer is thinking, “I wonder what he/she will think when he/she reads this part?” For me that first reader is my wife, Tabitha.

They feel that revising a story according to the likes and dislikes of an audience is somehow akin to prostitution.

Too many writing classes make Wait a minute, explain what you meant by that a kind of bylaw.

Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy. Some of this book—perhaps too much—has been about how I learned to do it. Much of it has been about how you can do it better. The rest of it—and perhaps the best of it—is a permission slip: you can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will.


# Letters for a Nation: From Jawaharlal Nehru to His Chief Ministers 1947-1963 (Nehru, Jawaharlal)

From a letter dated 20 February 1948.

From a letter dated 16 August 1948.

Yet politics—a domain of pressing, ceaseless demands—offered an uneasy career for those like him who strove for self-reflection and sought careful scrutiny of their own actions.

By the time Nehru wrote his final letter on 21 December 1963, nearly four hundred letters had been written.

The third book, The Discovery of India, is a text often read as an argument for India’s essential unity.

Democracy could be consolidated. Now, as prime minister, Nehru was at pains to emphasize that democracies had no special claim to survival. They were as likely to succeed or fail as any other form of political association, and India’s liberty was as contingent.

Democracy could be consolidated. Now, as prime minister, Nehru was at pains to emphasize that democracies had no special claim to survival. They were as likely to succeed or fail as any other form of political association, and India’s liberty was as contingent as its captivity had been.

Democratic success in India would ultimately rest neither on radical institutional design which could magically work itself nor on any one special personality.

Feature—Nehru’s sense that democratic success in India would ultimately rest neither on radical institutional design which could magically work itself nor on any one special personality.

Making a nation, rather than merely administering it, was Nehru’s unique responsibility.

‘a secular State in which men of all communities can walk with their heads high’.

‘I am filled with deep distress and a sense of failure . . . We cannot run away from the task that history has set for us. But a cruel destiny seems to pursue us and nullify all our efforts’.

Democracies, he feared, had an odd capacity to encourage false optimism. Merely because the overall system was considered fair, its participants might be led to believe that things were proceeding according to plan and thus lose sight of the transformative potential of democratic politics.

In a speech in the Lok Sabha in 1956 Nehru refused to define socialism because he sought to avoid ‘any rigid or doctrinaire thinking’. ‘Even in my life,’ he observed, ‘I have seen the world change so much that I do not want to confine my mind to any rigid dogma.’.

The greatest talent of those in government, Rousseau once observed, is ‘to lead the state so peacefully that it appears not to need leaders’.

I have mentioned them in some of my public statements, but they are so important that I make no apology for reiterating them.

The remedy, he felt, lay in education rather than communal or caste reservations which would only intensify the focus on identity.

Maintaining throughout that communalism was among the greatest threats to India.

Some people talk rather foolishly of war, not perhaps appreciating what this means.

The danger to us is not so much external as internal.

The danger to us is not so much external as internal. Reactionary forces and communal organisations are trying to disrupt the structure of free India.

We have a great deal of evidence to show that the R.S.S. is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the technique of organisation.


# A River in Darkness (Masaji Ishikawa)

Sometimes in life, you have to grab your so-called destiny by the throat and wring its neck.

They knew that, however long they worked and however much effort they put in, they wouldn’t be rewarded for their labors; their pay would be the same. And they had to follow the instructions of amateurs who didn’t know what they were talking about. So of course they lost all motivation. Who could blame them?.

If you suffer long enough, it almost becomes funny, and you can find yourself laughing at the most miserable situations. I guess it’s a kind of hysteria.

Human beings are nothing if not irrational, so I did what countless people had done before me and countless others will do long after I’m dead: I prayed.

Human beings are nothing if not irrational, so I did what countless people had done before me and countless others will do long after I’m dead: I prayed. It didn’t even matter that I didn’t really believe in God. I prayed that no more tragedies would befall me. I prayed for my son’s health. I prayed for a change of fortune. I prayed every single day. And God watched over me. For five years. For five years, nothing happened to me at all. And then I turned thirty-one.


# The Accidental Tourist (Anne Tyler)

She had a broad, smooth face that gave an impression of calm, but if you looked closely you’d notice the tension at the corners of her eyes.

He had always disapproved of her messiness but now those spills seemed touching, like colorful toys left on the floor after a child has gone to bed.

Life was so full of things you couldn’t do anything about; you had to avert what you could.

(“Listen! They’re playing my song,” he used to say when Sarah switched the radio off.).

You mean to tell me you can just use a person up and then move on?.

“After a certain age,” he told Sarah, “it seems to me you can only choose what to lose.”.


# Nothing to Envy (Barbara Demick)

The cadence of life is slower in North Korea. Nobody owned a watch.

They don’t stop to think that in the middle of this black hole, in this bleak, dark country where millions have died of starvation, there is also love.

In the cities there are “pigeon coops,” one-room units in low-rise apartment buildings, while in the countryside, people typically live in single-story buildings called “harmonicas,” rows of one-room homes, stuck together like the little boxes that make up the chambers of a harmonica. Occasionally, door frames and window sashes are painted a startling turquoise, but mostly everything is whitewashed or gray.

The path to happiness was self-sacrifice and suppression of the individual for the good of the collective. Capitalism was pure degradation.

The imperatives of puberty would have to wait.

The children were never to forget that they owed everything to the national leadership.

Like German Jews in the early 1930s, who told themselves it couldn’t get any worse, the North Koreans deceived themselves.

Notwithstanding some incipient doubts about the political system—he was beginning to wonder why the East Germans tore down the Berlin Wall if communism was so great—he knew that party membership and a Pyongyang.

Notwithstanding some incipient doubts about the political system—he was beginning to wonder why the East Germans tore down the Berlin Wall if communism was so great—he knew that party membership and a Pyongyang education was his ticket to the core class.

Dr. Kim’s father viewed Kim Il-sung, not Mao, as the true inheritor of the Communist dream, the one who would be able to fulfill the promises of equality and justice made to workingmen like himself.

How do you tell a mother her child needs more food when there is nothing more to give?.

Even when her back was turned, she could feel their eyes staring at her white gown, wondering if she could relieve their pain and soon realizing that she could not.

“We Have Nothing to Envy in the World,”.

It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer Primo Levi identified after emerging from Auschwitz, when he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see one another again after the war because they.

It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer Primo Levi identified after emerging from Auschwitz, when he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see one another again after the war because they had all done something of which they were ashamed.

“simple and kindhearted people who did what they were told—they were the first to die.”.

By the end of 1998, the worst of the famine was over, not necessarily because anything had improved but, as Mrs. Song later surmised, because there were fewer mouths to feed. “Everybody who was going to die was already dead.”.

Much of the pleasure he took from reading was in the anticipation of telling Mi-ran about it later.

Much of the pleasure he took from reading was in the anticipation of telling Mi-ran about it later. During their long months apart, he would store up his best material, rehearsing it in his mind, imagining the way her eyes would flicker with delight, how she would laugh out loud without the coy gesture of covering her mouth. Now he held back even though his head was bursting with ideas he couldn’t share.

What good would it do to tell her anyway? If she knew what he knew, wouldn’t it just make her as unhappy as it had made him?.

Defectors had to be able to live with the knowledge that their freedom came at the expense of loved ones who would likely spend the rest of their lives in a labor camp.

After breakfast, the doctors were preoccupied with finding food for dinner, and after dinner, they worried about the next breakfast. She began leaving work early to scavenge in the mountains for edible weeds.

But now she couldn’t deny what was staring her plainly in the face: dogs in China ate better than doctors in North Korea.

Up until that moment, a part of her had hoped that China would be just as poor as North Korea. She still wanted to believe that her country was the best place in the world. The beliefs she had cherished for a lifetime would be vindicated. But now she couldn’t deny what was staring her plainly in the face: dogs in China ate better than doctors in North Korea.

We joked that unrequited, or in this case unconsummated, love affairs are the only ones that last forever.

“Now that I can call him on the phone whenever I want or send him a text, I’m not so interested,” Mi-ran admitted. “It’s hard for me to understand now why I spent so many years obsessing about this guy.”.


# The Rosie Effect (Graeme Simsion)

‘An extraordinarily clever, funny, and moving book about being comfortable with who you are and what you’re good at…This is one of the most profound novels I’ve read in a long time.’.

This was my favourite costume, assuming ‘no costume’ did not qualify as a costume.

Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and.

Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and inexplicable decision to select me as her partner.

My reflections were interrupted by Rosie emerging from the bedroom wearing only a towel. This was my favourite costume, assuming ‘no costume’ did not qualify as a costume. Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and inexplicable decision to select me as her partner.

My reflections were interrupted by Rosie emerging from the bedroom wearing only a towel. This was my favourite costume, assuming ‘no costume’ did not qualify as a costume. Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and inexplicable decision to select me as her partner. And, as always, that thought was followed by an unwanted emotion: an intense moment of fear that she would one day realise her error.

‘Don, conferences—overseas conferences—don’t count. That’s why people go to conferences. Everyone understands that.’.

Spreadsheet is the obvious tool for (1) through to (3), and if (4) is complex, as it would be in preparing for the existence of a new human being and providing for its needs over many years, project-planning software is appropriate. I was unaware of any spreadsheet and Gantt chart for a baby project.

I was happy in the way that I would be happy if the captain of an aircraft in which I was travelling announced that he had succeeded in restarting one engine after both had failed.

Rosie arrived home before Gene, which gave me the opportunity to screen her for depression. She kissed me on the cheek then took her bag into her study. I followed.

It doesn't matter where you are,
It doesn't matter how far,
I'll come for you when you ask

It doesn't matter how many seas separate us,
It doesn't matter if all the winds are against us,.

It doesn't matter where you are,

‘A single day is a poor indication of your overall happiness. Days vary. A week is a more useful indicator. It’s conventional to say “How was your day?” but more useful to say “How was your week?” We should adopt a new convention.’ Rosie smiled. ‘You could ask me how my day was every day, and then average it out.’ ‘Excellent idea. But I need a starting point. So, just for today, how have things been since this time last Thursday? Have things been getting on top of you?’.

Problem—‘Never trust any thought arrived at sitting down.’.

Father would quote Thoreau—‘Henry David Thoreau, American philosopher, Don,’ he would say as I walked around our living room working on a mathematics or chess problem—‘Never trust any thought arrived at sitting down.’.

People repeat themselves.’.

‘Is there some problem?’ I asked Rosie the next morning.

Sometimes, life gives you problems like choosing between a window seat or an aisle seat. Sometimes, life just throughs you in the middle seat. You struggle to secure access to the hand rests. You miss out on opportunity to see the world from the top. Miniature houses and cars, and people on the streets hustling, walking with inflated egos, hardly vissible. You miss out on the luxury to pee without agonizing your copassengers and possibility to flirt with a pretty cabin crew. What does the middle seat even has to offer, other than the chance to engage in conversation with two peope. But the who talks on a plane.

If you learn something from the project, wonderful, but surprise her with your skills rather than beating her over the head with your knowledge.’.

‘We shouldn’t be defeated by problems. If we think hard enough, a solution will present itself.’.

‘Guess how many women I’ve slept with.’ ‘Less than me,’ said George. ‘If you can count them, it’s less than me.’ ‘More than me,’ I said. Gene laughed. ‘Go on.’.

People cannot forget things on command. Being instructed to forget something is analogous to being instructed not to think of a pink elephant, or not to buy certain foodstuffs.

English is annoying in not having unambiguous responses for answering a question framed in the negative.


# The Hard Thing About Hard Things (Ben Horowitz)

People offer many complex reasons for why Bill rates so highly. In my experience it’s pretty simple. No matter who you are, you need two kinds of friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. Not a fake excitement veiling envy, but a real excitement. You need someone who will actually be more excited for you than he would be if it had happened to him. The second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong—when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call. Who is it going to.

“Remember, Ben, things are always darkest before they go completely black.”.

I tried to make myself feel better by asking, “What’s the worst thing that could happen?” The answer always came back the same: “We’ll go bankrupt, I’ll lose everybody’s money including my mother’s, I’ll have to lay off all the people who have been working so hard in a very bad economy, all of the customers who trusted me will be screwed, and my reputation will be ruined.” Funny, asking that question never made me feel any better.

Motivations—“able to charm dogs off a meat truck,”.

Anthony had an uncanny ability to quickly gain deep insight into people’s character and motivations—“able to charm dogs off a meat truck,” is how another guy on the team described it.

“Frank, I will do exactly as you say. I’ve heard you loud and clear. This is a terrible moment for you and for us. Allow me to use your phone, and I will call Ben Horowitz and give him your instructions. But before I do, can I ask you one thing? If my company made the commitment to fix these issues, how much time would you give us to do that?”.

Make no mistake, we have one bullet left in the gun and we must hit the target.”.

“Okay, listen carefully. Here’s what I’d like you to do. First, reach up to your face and take off your rose-colored glasses. Then get a Q-tip and clean the wax out of your ears. Finally, take off your pink panties and call the fucking vice president right now, because you do not have a deal.”.

Sometimes, however, the things you’re not doing are the things you should actually be focused on.

Note to self: It’s a good idea to ask, “What am I not doing?”.

But I don’t believe in statistics. I believe in calculus.

People always ask me, “What’s the secret to being a successful CEO?” Sadly, there is no secret, but if there is one skill that stands out, it’s the ability to focus and make the best move when there are no good moves.

In doing so, I follow the first principle of the Bushido—the way of the warrior: keep death in mind at all times. If a warrior keeps death in mind at all times and lives as though each day might be his last, he will conduct himself properly in all his actions.

The Struggle is when you are having a conversation with someone and you can’t hear a word that they are saying because all you can hear is the Struggle.

Every manager must lay off his own people.

Still, the company must move forward, so be careful not to apologize too much.

Help them carry their things to their cars. Let them know that you appreciate their efforts.

You hired for lack of weakness rather than for strengths. This is especially common when you run a consensus-based hiring process. The group will often find the candidate’s weaknesses, but they won’t place a high enough value on the areas where you need the executive to be a world-class performer. As a result, you hire an executive with no sharp weaknesses, but who is mediocre where you need her to be great. If you don’t have world-class strengths where you need them, you won’t be a world-class company.

Do not leave the discussion open-ended. This is not a performance review; it’s a firing. Use words and phrases like “I have decided” rather than “I think.”.

“Ben, you cannot let him keep his job, but you absolutely can let him keep his respect.”.

The best employees in the organization will likely be the ones closest to the executive. If you trash her, you will put all her best employees on notice that they are next. Is that a message you want to send?.

“In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting, and broken processes. They are not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are getting the job done or not. In the miracle case that they work ridiculous hours and get the job done, they have no idea what it means for the company or their careers. To make it all much worse and rub salt in the wound, when they finally work up the courage to tell management how fucked-up their situation is, management denies there is a problem, then defends the status quo, then ignores the problem.”.

Was never told how the rest of the code worked? A lot of companies think their employees are so smart that they require no training. That’s silly.

They hated their manager; generally the employees were appalled by the lack of guidance, career development, and feedback they were receiving.   They weren’t learning anything: The company wasn’t investing resources in helping employees develop new skills.

Therefore, being too busy to train is the moral equivalent of being too hungry to eat.

In your darkest moments as CEO, discussing fundamental questions about the viability of your company with your employees can have obvious negative consequences.

While it’s okay to give certain kinds of feedback in a group setting, you should strive never to embarrass someone in front of their peers. If you do so, then your feedback will have little impact other than to cause the employee to be horribly ashamed and to hate your guts.

If the company achieves product-market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number one, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the investors in a way that’s not at odds with the interests of the employees, and it is true.


# Food Rules (Pollan, Michael)

Don’t eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk.

For many of us, eating has surprisingly little to do with hunger. We eat out of boredom, for entertainment, to comfort or reward ourselves. Try to be aware of why you’re eating, and ask yourself if you’re really hungry—before you eat and then again along the way. (One old wives’ test: If you’re not hungry enough to eat an apple, then you’re not hungry.) Food is a costly antidepressant.

A related adage: “After lunch, sleep awhile; after dinner, walk a mile.”.


# Shoe Dog (Phil Knight)

Maybe because I still hadn’t experienced anything of life. Least of all its many temptations and excitements. I hadn’t smoked a cigarette, hadn’t tried a drug. I hadn’t broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just under way, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn’t yet rebelled. I couldn’t think of one time I’d cut loose, done the unexpected.

Maybe because I still hadn’t experienced anything of life. Least of all its many temptations and excitements. I hadn’t smoked a cigarette, hadn’t tried a drug. I hadn’t broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just under way, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn’t yet rebelled. I couldn’t think of one time I’d cut loose, done the unexpected. I’d never even been with a girl. If I tended to dwell on all the things I wasn’t, the reason was simple. Those were the things I knew best. I’d have found it difficult to say what or who exactly I was, or might become. Like all my friends I wanted to be successful. Unlike my friends I didn’t know what that meant. Money? Maybe. Wife? Kids? House? Sure, if I was lucky. These were the goals I was taught to aspire to, and part of me did aspire to them, instinctively. But deep down I was searching for something else, something more. I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And purposeful. And creative. And important. Above all . . . different. I wanted to leave a mark on the world. I wanted to win. No, that’s not right. I simply didn’t want to lose.

Every runner knows this. You run and run, mile after mile, and you never quite know why. You tell yourself that you’re running toward some goal, chasing some rush, but really you run because the alternative, stopping, scares you to death.

I wanted to experience what the Chinese call Tao, the Greeks call Logos, the Hindus call Jñāna, the Buddhists call Dharma. What the Christians call Spirit. Before setting out on my own personal life voyage, I thought, let me first understand the greater voyage of humankind. Let me explore the grandest temples and churches and shrines, the holiest rivers and mountaintops. Let me feel the presence of . . . God?.

Colonial house, beautiful wife, obedient kids, my father enjoyed having these things, but what he really cherished was his friends and neighbors knowing he had them.

I wasn’t built for heavy doses of rejection.

The junk merchant doesn’t sell his product to the consumer, he sells the consumer to his product.

But first I’d need to change my whole approach. I was a linear thinker, and according to Zen linear thinking is nothing but a delusion, one of the many that keep us unhappy. Reality is nonlinear, Zen says. No future, no past. All is now.

Don’t go to sleep one night, wrote Rūmī, the thirteenth-century Persian poet. What you most want will come to you then. Warmed by a sun inside you’ll see wonders.

Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.

A soldier in shoes is only a soldier. But in boots he becomes a warrior.

So why was selling shoes so different? Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.

People reflexively assume that competition is always a good thing, that it always brings out the best in people, but that’s only true of people who can forget the competition.

People reflexively assume that competition is always a good thing, that it always brings out the best in people, but that’s only true of people who can forget the competition. The art of competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting, and I now reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. You must forget that internal voice screaming, begging, “Not one more step!” And when it’s not possible to forget it, you must negotiate with it. I thought over all the races in which my mind wanted one thing, and my body wanted another, those laps in which I’d had to tell my body, “Yes, you raise some excellent points, but let’s keep going anyway . . .”.

Shook my head. I tell the man Blue Ribbon is sinking like the Titanic, and he responds by begging for a berth in first class.

“I want to be able to make it on Tiger, and the opportunity would exist for me to do other things as well—running, school, not to mention being my own boss.” I shook my head. I tell the man Blue Ribbon is sinking like the Titanic, and he responds by begging for a berth in first class.

No one could get your blood going like Bowerman, though he never raised his voice. He knew how to speak in subliminal italics, to slyly insert exclamation marks, like hot keys against the flesh.

Told her that I flat-out didn’t want to work for someone else. I wanted to build something that was my own, something I could point to and say: I made that. It was the only way I saw to make life meaningful.

Bowerman chuckled and said he wasn’t sure. He told me about the scandalous behavior of Puma and Adidas throughout the Games. The world’s two biggest athletic shoe companies—run by two German brothers who despised each other—had chased each other like Keystone Kops around the Olympic Village, jockeying for all the athletes. Huge sums of cash, often stuffed in running shoes or manila envelopes, were passed around. One of Puma’s sales reps even got thrown in jail.

He was married to a female sprinter, and Bowerman joked that he’d only married her to secure her endorsement.

“This spy may seem somewhat unethical to you, but the spy system is ingrained and completely accepted in Japanese business circles. They actually have schools for industrial spies, much as we have schools for typists and stenographers.”.

In Japan you couldn’t predict what either your competition or your partner might do. I’d given up trying. Instead, I wrote, “I’ve taken what I think is a big step to keep us informed.

Without going into a lengthy discussion of why I will just tell you that I feel he is trustworthy. “This spy may seem somewhat unethical to you, but the spy system is ingrained and completely accepted in Japanese business circles.

Penny and I were learning to live together, learning to meld our personalities and idiosyncrasies, though we agreed that she was the one with all the personality and I was the idiosyncratic one. Therefore it was she who had more to learn.

She was learning that I wasn’t housebroken. I left the toilet seat up, left my clothes where they fell, left food on the counter. I was effectively helpless. I couldn’t cook, or clean, or do even the simplest things for myself, because I’d been spoiled rotten by my mother and sisters. All those years in the servants’ quarters, I’d essentially had servants.

Above all, she was learning that marrying a man with a start-up shoe company meant living on a shoestring budget.

Above all, she was learning that marrying a man with a start-up shoe company meant living on a shoestring budget. And yet she thrived. I could give her only twenty-five dollars a week for groceries, and still she managed to whip up delicious meals. I gave her a credit card with a two-thousand-dollar limit to furnish our entire apartment, and she managed to buy a dinette table, two chairs, a Zenith TV, and a big couch with soft arms, perfect for napping. She also bought me a brown recliner, which she stuck in a corner of the living room. Now, each night, I could lean back at a forty-five-degree angle and spin inside my own head all I wanted. It was more comfortable, and safer, than the Cougar. I got into the habit every night of phoning my father from my recliner. He’d always be in his recliner, too, and together, recliner to recliner, we’d hash out the latest threat confronting Blue Ribbon. He no longer saw my business as a waste of my time, apparently. Though he didn’t say so explicitly, he did seem to find the problems I faced “interesting,” and “challenging,” which amounted to the same thing.

Life is growth. You grow or you die.

That night I told Penny that if Blue Ribbon failed we’d lose the house. She put a hand on her stomach and sat down. This was the kind of insecurity she’d always vowed to avoid. Okay, she kept saying, okaaaay.

Don’t you dare feel sorry for me. I’m here to kill you.

I struggle to remember. I close my eyes and think back, but so many precious moments from those nights are gone forever. Numberless conversations, breathless laughing fits. Declarations, revelations, confidences. They’ve all fallen into the sofa cushions of time. I remember only that we always sat up half the night, cataloging the past, mapping out the future. I remember that we took turns describing what our little company was, and what it might be, and what it must never be. How I wish, on just one of those nights, I’d had a tape recorder. Or kept a journal, as I did on my trip around the world.

“Because,” Woodell’s mother said, “if you can’t trust the company your son is working for, then who can you trust?”.

Yes, I thought. Confidence. More than equity, more than liquidity, that’s what a man needs. I wished I had more. I wished I could borrow some. But confidence was cash. You had to have some to get some. And people were loath to give it to you.

No news was bad news, no news was good news—but no news was always some sort of news.

A lot of things were rolling around in my head, consciously, unconsciously. First, Johnson had pointed out that seemingly all iconic brands—Clorox, Kleenex, Xerox—have short names. Two syllables or less. And they always have a strong sound in the name, a letter like “K” or “X,” that sticks in the mind. That all made sense. And that all described Nike.

He saw life as a battle and found confirmation for this view in books. Like me, he read compulsively about war.

Grow or die, that’s what I believed, no matter the situation.

I sighed, but the relief didn’t last. I started thinking about my life. I scrolled back years, questioning every decision I’d ever made that led to this point. If only I’d been better at selling encyclopedias, I thought. Everything would be different.

“There is no finish line.”.

I think constantly of the poverty I saw while traveling the world in the 1960s. I knew then that the only answer to such poverty is entry-level jobs. Lots of them. I didn’t form this theory on my own. I heard it from every economics professor I ever had, at both Oregon and Stanford, and everything I saw and read thereafter backed it up. International trade always, always benefits both trading nations.

Another thing I often heard from those same professors was the old maxim: “When goods don’t pass international borders, soldiers will.” Though I’ve been known to call business war without bullets, it’s actually a wonderful bulwark against war.

Another thing I often heard from those same professors was the old maxim: “When goods don’t pass international borders, soldiers will.” Though I’ve been known to call business war without bullets, it’s actually a wonderful bulwark against war. Trade is the path of coexistence, cooperation. Peace feeds on prosperity. That’s why, haunted as I was by the Vietnam War, I always vowed that someday Nike would have a factory in or near Saigon.

In yet another sense it’s a living, breathing expression of that vital human emotion, maybe the most vital of all, after love. Gratitude.

“You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.”.

I’d tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I’d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt. I’d like to warn the best of them, the iconoclasts, the innovators, the rebels, that they will always have a bull’s-eye on their backs. The better they get, the bigger the bull’s-eye. It’s not one man’s opinion; it’s a law of nature.

# India After Gandhi (Guha, Ramachandra)

The closer one gets to the present, the more judgement alone tends to become.

Notably, while Nehru always wanted Kashmir to be part of India, Patel was at one time inclined to allow the state to join Pakistan. His mind changed on 13 September, the day the Pakistan government accepted the accession of Junagadh.

The governor general, M. A. Jinnah, was a Gujarati who had married a Parsi. The prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan, was an aristocrat from the United Provinces who was married to aChristian. Neither was, in any sense of the term, apractising Muslim.

Neither was, in any sense of the term, apractising Muslim. The top civil servants of Pakistan were, like Jinnah and Liaqat, ‘mohajirs’, migrants whose ancestral homes lay on the Indian side of the border. The ruling class had no roots in what was now their state.

A hundred thousand people had come to hear Golwalkar espouse the idea of a Hindu theocratic state for India. But in this Maharashtrian stronghold, six times as many came to cheer the prime minister’s defence of democracy against absolutism, and secularism against Hindu chauvinism. In this contest between competing ideas of India, Jawaharlal Nehru was winning hands down; for the time being, at any rate.

‘Those who want that kind of thing have a place in Pakistan, not here,’ thundered Patel to a burst of applause. ‘Here, we are building a nation and we are laying the foundations of One Nation, and those who choose to divide again and sow the seeds of disruption will have no place, no quarter, here, and I must say that plainly enough.’.

The printed proceedings continue: The Chairman: Order, order! Shri R. V. Dhulekar (speaking still in Hindustani): I request you to allow me to move my amendment. The Chairman: Order, order! I do not permit you to proceed further. The House is with me that you are out of order.48 At this point Jawaharlal Nehru went up to the rostrum and persuaded Dhulekar to return to his seat. Afterwards Nehru told the errant member of the need to maintain discipline in the House. He told him that ‘this is not a public meeting in Jhansi that you should address “Bhaio aur Behno” [brothers and sisters] and start lecturing at the top of your voice.

The prime minister thought that public officials should never publicly associate with faiths and shrines.

A visiting Turkish journalist focused on the content of the election rather than its form. He admired Nehru’s decision not to follow other Asian countries in taking ‘the line of least resistance’ by developing ‘a dictatorship with centralisation of power and intolerance of dissent and criticism’. The prime minister had ‘wisely kept away from such temptations’. Yet the ‘main credit’, according to the Turkish writer, ‘goes to the nation itself; 176,000,000 Indians were left all alone with their conscience in face of the polling box. It was direct and secret voting. They had their choice between theocracy, chauvinism, communal separatism and isolationism on the one side; secularism, national unity, stability, moderation and friendly intercourse with the rest of the world on the other. They showed their maturity in choosing moderation and progress and disapproving of reaction and unrest.’ So impressed was this observer that he took a delegation of his countrymen to meet Sukumar Sen. The chief election commissioner showed them samples of ballot boxes, ballot papers and symbols, as well as the plan of a polling station, so that they could work to resume the interrupted progress of democracy in their own country.55.

Gods, living in a country that was even more heathen.

For what the world most lacked, said Nehru, was ‘under-standing and appreciation of each other among nations and peoples’.

The prospective city-state, he argued, had a ‘cosmopolitan population in every respect’; it had been ‘built upon the labour of everybody’. If left to govern itself, Bombay would ‘be a miniature India run on international standards’ . . . [A] melting pot which will evolve a glorious new civilisation . . . And it is an extraordinary coincidence that the population of the city should be exactly one per cent of the population of the whole country. This one per cent drawn from all parts of the country will set the pace for other states in the practice of secularism and mutual understanding.’.

‘To ask us to serve the nation is to ask chandan [sandalwood] to be fragrant.’.

There were large areas of the economy where the private sector could not be trusted, where the aims of planning could be realized only ‘if the matter is handled as a collective Public Enterprise’.10.

Energy, infrastructure and transport were sectors where the Indian capitalists themselves felt the need for a government monopoly.

Energy, infrastructure and transport were sectors where the Indian capitalists themselves felt the need for a government monopoly. In the early stages of industrialization, they argued, it was necessary that ‘the State should exercise in the interests of the community a considerable measure of intervention and control’. Indeed, ‘an enlargement of the positive as well as preventative functions of the State is essential to any large-scale economic planning’.11 Now largely forgotten, the Bombay Plan gives the lie to the claim that Jawaharlal Nehru imposed a model of centralized economic development on an unwilling capitalist class. One wonders what free-market pundits would make of it now. They would probably see it as a dirigiste tract, unworthy of capitalism and capitalists. In truth, it should be seen simply as symptomatic of the Zeitgeist, of the spirit of the times.

As the second plan argued, underdevelopment was ‘essentially a consequence of insufficient technological progress’.

‘if an item of equipment was imported from abroad, all one got was that particular instrument. But if one built it oneself, an all-important lesson in expertise was learnt as well’.

‘Whenever I see these great engineering works’, wrote Jawaharlal Nehru, ‘I feel excited and exhilarated. They are visible symbols of building up the new India and of providing life and sustenance to our people’.64 It appears the excitement and exhilaration were felt by plenty of other Indians as well.

THE FRENCH WRITER André Malraux once asked Jawaharlal Nehru what had been his ‘greatest difficulty since Independence’. Nehru replied: ‘Creating a just state by just means’. Then he added, ‘Perhaps, too, creating a secular state in a religious country’.

‘Take it from me that the Muslim community is prepared to have it but you are not brave enough to do it.’.

‘for Pakistan, Kashmir is a vital necessity; for India it is an imperialistic adventure’.

The most difficult thing in life is what to do with one’s friends.

‘promises, like piecrusts, are meant to be broken’.

When the Chinese leader asked how the Indians could have allowed their soil to be used by Tibetan dissidents, Desai answered that ‘in our country everybody holds conventions; the Algerians do so and so do the Indians sometimes [against their Government]’. Then he cleverly (or perhaps mischievously) added: ‘The Chinese Prime Minister is aware that Lenin sought asylum in the UK but nobody restricted his political activities. We in India do not encourage anyone to conspire against China but we cannot prevent people from expressing their opinions. Freedom of speech is the basis of our democracy.’.

When an opposition member taunted Nehru with regard to his remark that Aksai Chin was barren land, with no grass growing on it, a Congress MP added this telling supplement: ‘No hair grows on my head. Does it mean that the head has no value?’ This was widely viewed as a dig at Nehru who, of course, was completely bald himself.59.

That Goa was legitimately part of India was not in dispute. That India had waited long enough before acting was also evident. Still, the timing of what was called ‘Operation Vijay’ was open to question. Why did it take place in December 1961 rather than December 1960 or December 1962? Nehru perhaps thought he had waited long enough for the Portuguese to leave; fourteen whole years. And he was under pressure from both left and right on the issue; the Jana Sangh and the communists, in a rare show of agreement, were urging him to use the army to liberate the colony. Still, the suspicion lingered that the precise timing of the invasion was determined by the electoral needs of his colleague Krishna Menon. Before the troops went in, the defence minister inspected them on the border. As the New York Times reported, he was here ‘conducting a double campaign : one for the war that was about to commence, the other for the general election that had been scheduled for February 1962.

The border war provoked a reluctant tilt towards the United States, who had come forth with arms while Soviet Russia stayed neutral.

Austin saw a weeping Mahmud given a helping hand by Jagjivan Ram, a senior Congress politician and Cabinet minister of low-caste origin. This was truly ‘a scene symbolic of Nehru’s India: a Muslim aided by an Untouchable coming to the home of a caste Hindu’.

For it was the UP intellectuals who had claimed that ‘Muslims were a separate nation’. Now, for those who had chosen not to go to Pakistan, it was not enough to give ’mere declarations of loyalty to the Indian Union , they ‘must give practical proof of their declarations’.

To one aspect of security which has assumed urgency and importance in the present context of relations with Pakistan. There is growing evidence that a section of Muslims in India is out of sympathy with the Government of India, particularly because of its policy regarding Kashmir and Hyderabad, and is actively sympathetic to Pakistan. Such Government servants are likely to be useful channels of information and would be particularly susceptible to the influence of their relatives. It is probable that among Muslim employees of Government there are some who belong to these categories. It is obvious that they constitute a dangerous element in the fabric of administration; and it is essential that they should not be entrusted with any confidential or secret work or allowed to hold key posts. For this purpose I would request you to prepare lists of Muslim employees in your Ministry and in the offices under your control, whose loyalty to the Dominion of India is suspected or who are likely to constitute a threat to security. These lists should be carefully prepared and scrutinised by the Heads of Departments or other higher authority, and should be used for the specific purposes of excluding persons from holding key posts or handling confidential or secret work. I need scarcely add that I am sure you will see that there is no witch hunting; and that only genuine cases are included in the lists. Those who are loyal and whose work is satisfactory should of course be given every cause to feel that their claims are no less than those of men belonging to the majoritycommunity.

Here he took issue with a BBC report that claimed that ‘since India’s Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri is a Hindu, he is ready for war with Pakistan’. Shastri said that while he was a Hindu, ‘Mir Mushtaq who is presiding over this meeting is a Muslim. Mr Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring this all into politics . . . This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose [and] worship in anyway we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.’.

In calling an early poll, the prime minister had astutely dissociated the general election from elections to the various state assemblies which in the past had always taken place concurrently. That meant that parochial considerations of caste and ethnicity got mixed up with wider national questions.

As the Jana Sangh leader Atal Behari Vajpayee ruefully remarked, while the opposition had put up 2,700 separate candidates, the ruling party had in effect fielded the same person in every constituency – Indira Gandhi.

But, argued Bhagwati, it had failed on both counts. It had grown too slowly to qualify as a ‘capitalist’ economy, and by its failure to eradicate illiteracy or reduce inequalities had forfeited any claims to being ‘socialist’.

‘the Indian youth are lily-livered. They have no guts. In their thinking they are dovetailed to the mental framework of their parents.’.

‘Today is India’s Independence Day’, said the ad. ‘Don’t Let the Light Go Out on India’s Democracy’.

‘Sometimes I wish’, said the newly elected prime minister of the world’s most populous democracy, that ‘we had a real revolution – like France or Russia – at the time of independence.’.

But if we only sing the praises of the Government, what will our readers think of us?’.

The journalist found that the business community were especially pleased with the emergency. A Delhi hotel owner told him that life now was ‘just wonderful. We used to have terrible problems with the unions. Now when they give us any troubles, the government just put them in jail.’ In Bombay, the journalist met J. R. D. Tata, arguably India’s most respected industrialist. Tata too felt that ‘things had gone too far. You can’t imagine what we’ve been through here – strikes, boycotts, demonstrations. Why, there were days I couldn’t walk out of my office into the street. The parliamentary system is not suited to our needs.’.

There was only one TV channel in 1977, this run by the state, and in normal circumstances half of Delhi’s adult population would have been huddled around their screens. But, as one pro-Janata paper gleefully reported, on this day Babuji had won over Bobby. A million people heard JP and Jagjivan Ram speak, along with the leaders of the other opposition parties, all now pledged to a common fight against Indira Gandhi and the Congress.

The results of the elections delighted many, angered some and surprised all.

The cheering crowds of yesterday may turn into a jeering mob tomorrow.’.

It was being said that while it had taken the Congress thirty years to abandon its principles, Janata had lost them within a year of its formation.50.

He flew Avros to Luck now and Jaipur, and his main professional ambition was to be allowed to pilot Boeings between Delhi and Bombay.

There was also a contemporary model at hand – that of Israel. If the few Jews there could keep the more numerous Arabs at bay, said Bhindranwale, then the Sikhs could and must do the same with the Hindus.

As it happened, the formation of the BJP heralded a wave of religious violence in northern and western India. There were major Hindu-Muslim riots in the Uttar Pradesh towns of Moradabad (August 1980) and Meerut (September–October 1982); in the Bihar town of Biharsharif in April–May 1981; in the Gujarat towns of Vadodara (September 1981), Godhra (October 1981) and Ahmedabad (January 1982); in Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh, in September 1983; and in the Maharashtra towns of Bhiwandi and Bombay in May–June 1984. In each case the riots ran on for days, with much loss of life and property, and were finally quelled only by armed force.56.

When Indira Gandhi took charge in 1966, wrote Krishna Raj, ‘she found a reasonably well-organised Congress party, with several layers of responsive leadership across the length and breadth of the country’. But she then ‘dismantled the party and she did so with a clear purposiveness. Because she did not trust anyone who would not play a subservient role to her and her family, she got rid of the intermediate leadership and re-built the party as a paper entity, without a democratic structure and with office-bearers personally selected and named by her.’.

In India the choice could never be between chaos and stability, but between manageable and unmanageable chaos, between humane and inhuman anarchy, and between tolerable and intolerable disorder.

The ‘distance between Gandhi (Mahatma) and Gandhi (Rajiv)’, remarked one observer, ‘is a vast traverse in political ethic. The dhoti is out, so is the walking stick, wooden sandals and travelling in third-class railway compartments. Gucci shoes, Cartier sunglasses, bullet-proof vests, Mercedes Benz cars and state helicopters are in.

The ‘distance between Gandhi (Mahatma) and Gandhi (Rajiv)’, remarked one observer, ‘is a vast traverse in political ethic. The dhoti is out, so is the walking stick, wooden sandals and travelling in third-class railway compartments. Gucci shoes, Cartier sunglasses, bullet-proof vests, Mercedes Benz cars and state helicopters are in. Indian politics no longer smells of sweat, nor is it particularly clean and odourless – it reeks of aftershave.’44.

In Bihar, the landowning castes, Bhumihars and Rajputs, battled with the literate Kayasths for the top jobs in the Congress organization.

The cow was found all over India. Hindus too were found all over India. And Hindus worshipped the cow, whereas Muslims and Christians preferred to butcher and eat it. That was the logic on which the RSS sought to build a nationwide campaign.

When India played Pakistan, it was demanded of Muslims that they display the national flag outside their homes, and that they loudly and publicly cheer for the national side. In the poet’s words: ‘Never mind my love for my motherland/ What’s important is how much I hate the other land’.28.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘pogrom’ as ‘an organized massacre of a particular ethnic group’. By this definition, while there have been hundreds of inter-religious riots in the history of independent India, there have been only two pogroms: that directed at the Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and that directed at the Muslims of south Gujarat in 2002. There are some striking similarities between the two. Both began as a response to a single, stray act of violence committed by members of the minority community. Both proceeded to take a generalized revenge on the minorities as a whole. The Sikhs who were butchered were in no way connected to the Sikhs who killed Mrs Gandhi. The Muslims who were killed by Hindu mobs were completely innocent of the Godhra crime (which may anyway have been an accident).

The great German sociologist Max Weber once remarked that ‘there are two ways of making politics one’s vocation: Either one lives “for” politics or one lives “off” it’.51 The first generation of Indian leaders lived mostly for politics. They were attracted by the authority they wielded, but also often motivated by a spirit of service and sacrifice. The current generation of Indian politicians, however, are more likely to enter politics to live off it. They are attracted by the power and prestige it offers, and also by the opportunities for financial reward. Control over the state machinery, they know, can bestow glittering prizes upon those in charge.

These, he said, treated the entrepreneur ‘as a criminal who has dared to use his brains independently of the state to create wealth and give employment’.

What do Indians do when they are not working or fighting or raising a family?.

Most of them go to the movies.

‘I want people to forget their misery. I want to take them into a dream world where there is no poverty, where there are no beggars, where fate is kind and God is busy looking after hisflock.’.

‘nothing can induce workingmen and women to read stories that treat of their own world. They are the most consummate idealists in creation, especially the women . . . The working classes detest anything that tries to represent their daily life.’.

It soon became the best-known voice in India, the ‘voice to which the road-side vendor in Delhi has transacted his business, the long-distance trucker has sped along the highway, the Army jawan in Ladakh has kept guard at his frontier bunker and to which the glittering elite have dined in luxury hotels’.

Is India a democracy, then? The answer is well, phipty-phipty. It mostly is when it comes to holding elections and permitting freedom of movement and expression. It mostly is not when it comes to the functioning of politicians and political institutions. However, that India is even a 50 per cent democracy flies in the face of tradition, history and the conventional wisdom.

Behind every successful nationalist movement in the Western world has been a certain unifying factor, a glue holding the members of the nation together, this provided by a shared language, a shared religious faith, a shared territory, a common enemy – and sometimes all of the above.

For Jawaharlal Nehru and his colleagues, if India was anything at all it was not a ‘Hindu Pakistan’.

Like Indian democracy, Indian secularism is also a story that combines success with failure. Membership of a minority religion is no bar to advancement in business or the professions. The richest industrialist in India is a Muslim. Some of the most popular film stars are Muslim. At least three presidents and three chief justices have been Muslim. In 2007, the president of India is a Muslim, the prime minister a Sikh, and the leader of the ruling party a Catholic born in Italy. Many of the country’s most prominent lawyers and doctors have been Christians and Parsis.

Indian nationalism has not been based on a shared language, religion, or ethnic identity. Perhaps one should then invoke the presence of a common enemy, namely European colonialism. The problem here is the methods used to achieve India’s freedom. The historian Michael Howard claims that ‘no Nation, in the true sense of the word ... could be born without war ... no self-conscious community could establish itself as a new and independent actor on the world scene without an armed conflict or the threat of one’.23 Once again, India must count as an exception. Certainly, it was the movement against British rule that first united men and women from different parts of the subcontinent in a common and shared endeavour. However, their (eventually successful) movement for political freedom eschewed violent revolution in favour of non-violent resistance. India emerged as a nation on the world stage without an armed conflict or, indeed, the threat of one.

All around him were conflict and privation, but doomsday had not yet come. ‘Why does not the Last Trumpet sound? asked Ghalib of a sage in the holy city of Benares. ‘Who holds the reins of the Final Catastrophe?’ This was the answer he got: The hoary old man of lucent ken Pointed towards Kashi and gently smiled. ‘The Architect’, he said, ‘is fond of this edifice Because of which there is colour in life; He Would not like it to perish and fall’. Ghalib and his interlocutor were speaking then of India, the civilization. Speaking now of India, the nation-state, one must insist that its future lies not in the hands of God but in the mundane works of men. So long as the constitution is not amended beyond recognition, so long as elections are held regularly and fairly and the ethos of secularism broadly prevails, so long as citizens can speak and write in the language of their choosing, so long as there is an integrated market and a moderately efficient civil service and army, and – lest I forget – so long as Hindi films are watched and their songs sung, India will survive.


# How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) - Wait But Why (waitbutwhy.com)

Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy.

An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.

It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.

It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are.

Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.

Wisdom isn’t correlated with knowledge, it’s correlated with being in touch with reality—it’s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it’s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it’s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves—because they fundamentally don’t get how knowing yourself works. They haven’t reached that stage yet.

The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you’ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don’t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it’s because you’re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing.

There are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly against others.

While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to deploy. Needless to say, the other.

Particular are yearning for that career—and which specific.

And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.

If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn’t really you and isn’t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.

Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.

This is why so many of history’s legends were famously single-minded—they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships,.

# Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne From Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest (Stephen E. Ambrose)

"The desire to be better than the other guy took hold." Each man in his own way had gone through what Richard Winters experienced: a realization that doing his best was a better way of getting through the Army than hanging around with the sad excuses for soldiers they met in the recruiting depots or basic training. They wanted to make their Army time positive, a learning and maturing and challenging experience.

Sobel was the classic chickenshit. He generated maximum anxiety over matters of minimum significance.

"Chickenshit refers to behavior that makes military life worse than it need be: petty harassment of the weak by the strong; open scrimmage for power and authority and prestige, - sadism thinly disguised as necessary discipline,- a constant 'paying off of old scores'; and insistence on the letter rather than the spirit of ordinances. Chickenshit is so called—instead of horse- or bull- or elephant shit—because it is small-minded and ignoble and takes the trivial seriously."(3).

# On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous (Ocean Vuong)

I am writing to reach you—even if each word I put down is one word further from where you are.

I am writing because they told me to never start a sentence with because. But I wasn’t trying to make a sentence—I was trying to break free. Because freedom, I am told, is nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.

I read the first book that I loved, a children’s book called Thunder Cake, by Patricia Polacco. In the story, when a girl and her grandmother spot a storm brewing on the green horizon, instead of shuttering the windows or nailing boards on the doors, they set out to bake a cake.

I read the first book that I loved, a children’s book called Thunder Cake, by Patricia Polacco. In the story, when a girl and her grandmother spot a storm brewing on the green horizon, instead of shuttering the windows or nailing boards on the doors, they set out to bake a cake. I was unmoored by this act, its precarious yet bold refusal of common sense. As Mrs. Callahan stood behind me, her mouth at my ear, I was pulled deeper into the current of language. The story unfurled, its storm rolled in as she spoke, then rolled in once more as I repeated the words. To bake a cake in the eye of a storm; to feed yourself sugar on the cusp of danger.

Migration can be triggered by the angle of sunlight, indicating a change in season, temperature, plant life, and food supply. Female monarchs lay eggs along the route. Every history has more than one thread, each thread a story of division. The journey takes four thousand eight hundred and thirty miles, more than the length of this country. The monarchs that fly south will not make it back north. Each departure, then, is final. Only their children return; only the future revisits the past.

How you threw up afterward, your whole head in the garbage can. How, in my screeching delight, I forgot to say Thank you.

I am twenty-eight years old, 5ft 4in tall, 112lbs. I am handsome at exactly three angles and deadly from everywhere else. I am writing you from inside a body that used to be yours. Which is to say, I am writing as a son.

You once told me that the human eye is god’s loneliest creation. How so much of the world passes through the pupil and still it holds nothing. The eye, alone in its socket, doesn’t even know there’s another one, just like it, an inch away, just as hungry, as empty. Opening the front door to the first snowfall of my life, you whispered, “Look.”.

What I really wanted to say was that a monster is not such a terrible thing to be. From the Latin root monstrum, a divine messenger of catastrophe, then adapted by the Old French to mean an animal of myriad origins: centaur, griffin, satyr. To be a monster is to be a hybrid signal, a lighthouse: both shelter and warning at once.

Came to know, in those afternoons, that madness can sometimes lead to discovery, that the mind, fractured and short-wired, is not entirely wrong. The room filled and refilled with our voices as the snow fell from her head, the hardwood around my knees whitening as the past unfolded around us.

Some people say history moves in a spiral, not the line we have come to expect. We travel through time in a circular trajectory, our distance increasing from an epicenter only to return again, one circle removed.

It’s true that, in Vietnamese, we rarely say I love you, and when we do, it is almost always in English.

It’s true that, in Vietnamese, we rarely say I love you, and when we do, it is almost always in English. Care and love, for us, are pronounced clearest through service: plucking white hairs, pressing yourself on your son to absorb a plane’s turbulence and, therefore, his fear.

“Everything good is somewhere else, baby. I’m telling you. Everything.”.

There is so much I want to tell you, Ma. I was once foolish enough to believe knowledge would clarify, but some things are so gauzed behind layers of syntax and semantics, behind days and hours, names forgotten, salvaged and shed, that simply knowing the wound exists does nothing to reveal it.

I don’t know what I’m saying. I guess what I mean is that sometimes I don’t know what or who we are. Days I feel like a human being, while other days I feel more like a sound. I touch the world not as myself but as an echo of who I was. Can you hear me yet? Can you read me?.

When I first started writing, I hated myself for being so uncertain, about images, clauses, ideas, even the pen or journal I used. Everything I wrote began with maybe and perhaps and ended with I think or I believe. But my doubt is everywhere, Ma. Even when I know something to be true as bone I fear the knowledge will dissolve, will not, despite my writing it, stay real. I’m breaking us apart again so that I might carry us somewhere else—where, exactly, I’m not sure. Just as I don’t know what to call you—White, Asian, orphan, American, mother?.

Sometimes you are erased before you are given the choice of stating who you.

A writer is someone who plays with the body of his mother, he says after the death of his own mother, in order to glorify it, to embellish it.

Being sorry pays, being sorry even, or especially, when one has no fault, is worth every self-deprecating syllable the mouth allows. Because the mouth must eat.

I studied him like a new word.

I remember it all because how can you forget anything about the day you first found yourself beautiful?.

Because submission, I soon learned, was also a kind of power.

Do you remember the happiest day of your life? What about the saddest? Do you ever wonder if sadness and happiness can be combined, to make a deep purple feeling, not good, not bad, but remarkable simply because you didn’t have to live on one side or the other?.

Sometimes, when I’m careless, I think survival is easy: you just keep moving forward with what you have, or what’s left of what you were given, until something changes—or you realize, at last, that you can change without disappearing, that all you had to do was wait until the storm passes you over and you find that—yes—your name is still attached to a living thing.

Once, at a writing conference, a white man asked me if destruction was necessary for art. His question was genuine. He leaned forward, his blue gaze twitching under his cap stitched gold with ’Nam Vet 4 Life, the oxygen tank connected to his nose hissing beside him. I regarded him the way I do every white veteran from that war, thinking he could be my grandfather, and I said no. “No, sir, destruction is not necessary for art.” I said that, not because I was certain, but because I thought my saying it would help me believe.

They say addiction might be linked to bipolar disorder. It’s the chemicals in our brains, they say. I got the wrong chemicals, Ma. Or rather, I don’t get enough of one or the other. They have a pill for it. They have an industry. They make millions. Did you know people get rich off of sadness? I want to meet the millionaire of American sadness. I want to look him in the eye, shake his hand, and say, “It’s been an honor to serve my country.”.

Using a multimillion-dollar ad campaign, Purdue sold OxyContin to doctors as a safe, “abuse-resistant” means of managing pain. The company went on to claim that less than one percent of users became addicted, which was a lie. By 2002, prescriptions of OxyContin for noncancer pain increased nearly ten times, with total sales reaching over $3 billion.

As a rule, “little” is always smaller than “small.” Don’t ask me why.

I’m sorry I keep saying How are you? when I really mean Are you happy?.

If you find yourself trapped inside a dimming world, remember it was always this dark inside the body. Where the heart, like any law, stops only for the living.

If you find yourself, then congratulations, your hands are yours to keep.

And because denial, fabrication—storytelling—was her way of staying one step ahead of her life, how could any of us tell her she was wrong?.

The Greeks thought sex was the attempt of two bodies, separated long ago, to return to one life. I don’t know if I believe this but that’s what it felt like: as if we were two people mining one body, and in doing so, merged, until no corner was left saying I.

# Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (Yuval Noah Harari)

Famine, plague and war were always at the top of the list.

For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.

For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald’s than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.

In the eighteenth century Marie Antoinette allegedly advised the starving masses that if they ran out of bread, they should just eat cake instead. Today, the poor are following this advice to the letter. Whereas the rich residents of Beverly Hills eat lettuce salad and steamed tofu with quinoa, in the slums and ghettos the poor gorge on Twinkie cakes, Cheetos, hamburgers and pizza.

The victory has been so complete that today the WHO has stopped vaccinating humans against smallpox.

Microorganisms may have 4 billion years of cumulative experience fighting organic enemies, but they have exactly zero experience fighting bionic predators, and would therefore find it doubly difficult to evolve effective defences.

Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.

Today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can conquer oil fields through war, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. Hence as knowledge became the most important economic resource, the profitability of war declined and wars became increasingly restricted to those parts of the world – such as the Middle East and Central Africa – where the economies are still old-fashioned material-based economies.

25 For the average American or European, Coca-Cola poses a far deadlier threat than al-Qaeda.

Terrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot budge even a single teacup. So it finds a bull, gets inside its ear and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the Middle East in the last decade. Islamic fundamentalists could never have toppled Saddam Hussein by themselves. Instead they enraged the USA by the 9/11 attacks, and the USA destroyed the Middle Eastern china shop for them. Now they flourish in the wreckage. By themselves, terrorists are too weak to drag us back to the Middle Ages and re-establish the Jungle Law. They may provoke us, but in the end, it all depends on our reactions. If the Jungle Law comes back into force, it will not be the fault of terrorists.

Those arguing that the world of 2016 is as hungry, sick and violent as it was in 1916 perpetuate this age-old defeatist view.

Those arguing that the world of 2016 is as hungry, sick and violent as it was in 1916 perpetuate this age-old defeatist view. They imply that all the huge efforts humans have made during the twentieth century have achieved nothing, and that medical research, economic reforms and peace initiatives have all been in vain. If so, what is the point of investing our time and resources in further medical research, novel economic reforms or new peace initiatives?.

How exactly do humans die? Medieval fairy tales depicted Death as a figure in a hooded black cloak, his hand gripping a large scythe. A man lives his life, worrying about this and that, running here and there, when suddenly the Grim Reaper appears before him, taps him on the shoulder with a bony finger and says, ‘Come!’ And the man implores: ‘No, please! Wait just a year, a month, a day!’ But the hooded figure hisses: ‘No! You must come NOW!’ And this is how we die.

‘We aren’t trying to gain a few yards. We are trying to win the game.’ Why? Because, says Maris, ‘it is better to live than to die’.

‘You can accept it, you can deny it or you can fight it. I think our society is dominated by people who are into denial or acceptance, and I prefer to fight it.’.

Schools were founded to produce skilful and obedient citizens who would serve the nation loyally.

Schools were founded to produce skilful and obedient citizens who would serve the nation loyally. At eighteen, youths needed to be not only patriotic but also literate, so that they could read the brigadier’s order of the day and draw up tomorrow’s battle plans.

Schools were founded to produce skilful and obedient citizens who would serve the nation loyally. At eighteen, youths needed to be not only patriotic but also literate, so that they could read the brigadier’s order of the day and draw up tomorrow’s battle plans. They had to know mathematics in order to calculate the shell’s trajectory or crack the enemy’s secret code. They needed a reasonable command of electrics, mechanics and medicine, in order to operate wireless sets, drive tanks and take care of wounded comrades. When they left the army they were expected to serve the nation as clerks, teachers and engineers, building a modern economy and paying lots of taxes. The same went for the health system. At the end of the nineteenth century countries such as France, Germany and Japan began providing free health care for the masses. They financed vaccinations for infants, balanced diets for children and physical education for teenagers. They drained festering swamps, exterminated mosquitoes and built centralised sewage systems. The aim wasn’t to make people happy, but to make the nation stronger. The country needed sturdy soldiers and workers, healthy women who would give birth to more soldiers and workers, and bureaucrats who came to the office punctually at 8 a.m. instead of lying sick at home.

Even the welfare system was originally planned in the interest of the nation rather than of needy individuals. When Otto von Bismarck pioneered state pensions and social security in late nineteenth-century Germany, his chief aim was to ensure the loyalty of the citizens rather than to increase their well-being. You fought for your country when you were eighteen, and paid your taxes when you were forty, because you counted on the state to take care of you when you were seventy.

In the twentieth century per capita GDP was perhaps the supreme yardstick for evaluating national success. From this perspective, Singapore, each of whose citizens produces on average $56,000 worth of goods and services a year, is a more successful country than Costa Rica, whose citizens produce only $14,000 a year. But nowadays thinkers, politicians and even economists are calling to supplement or even replace GDP with GDH – gross domestic happiness. After all, what do people want? They don’t want to produce. They want to be happy. Production is important because it provides the material basis for happiness. But it is only the means, not the end. In one survey after another Costa Ricans report far higher levels of life satisfaction than Singaporeans. Would you rather be a highly productive but dissatisfied Singaporean, or a less productive but satisfied Costa Rican?.

In the long run, a deep friendship will make us more content than a frenzied orgy.

It took just a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer?.

On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions.

On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. We don’t become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon. Dramatic improvements in conditions, as humankind has experienced in recent decades, translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment. If we don’t do something about this, our future achievements too might leave us as dissatisfied as ever. On the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry, rather than by our economic, social or political situation. According to Epicurus, we are happy when we feel pleasant sensations and are free from unpleasant ones. Jeremy Bentham similarly maintained that nature gave dominion over man to two masters – pleasure and pain – and they alone determine everything we do, say and think. Bentham’s successor, John Stuart Mill, explained that happiness is nothing but pleasure and freedom from pain, and that beyond pleasure and pain there is no good and no evil. Anyone who tries to deduce good and evil from something else (such as the word of God, or the national interest) is fooling you, and perhaps fooling himself too.35.

According to the life sciences, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations.

According to the life sciences, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations. We never react to events in the outside world, but only to sensations in our own bodies. Nobody suffers because she lost her job, because she got divorced or because the government went to war. The only thing that makes people miserable is unpleasant sensations in their own bodies. Losing one’s job can certainly trigger depression, but depression itself is a kind of unpleasant bodily sensation. A thousand things may make us angry, but anger is never an abstraction. It is always felt as a sensation of heat and tension in the body, which is what makes anger so infuriating. Not for nothing do we say that we ‘burn’ with anger.

What might have happened if a rare mutation had created a squirrel who, after eating a single nut, enjoys an everlasting sensation of bliss? Technically, this could actually be done by rewiring the squirrel’s brain. Who knows, perhaps it really happened to some lucky squirrel millions of years ago. But if so, that squirrel enjoyed an extremely happy and extremely short life, and that was the end of the rare mutation. For the blissful squirrel would not have bothered to look for more nuts, let alone mates. The rival squirrels, who felt hungry again five minutes after eating a nut, had much better chances of surviving and passing their genes to the next generation. For exactly the same reason, the nuts we humans seek to gather – lucrative jobs, big houses, good-looking partners – seldom satisfy us for long.

Climbing Mount Everest is more satisfying than standing at the top; flirting and foreplay are more exciting than having an orgasm; and conducting groundbreaking lab experiments is more interesting than receiving praise and prizes.

People drink alcohol to forget, they smoke pot to feel peaceful, they take cocaine and methamphetamines to be sharp and confident, whereas Ecstasy provides ecstatic sensations and LSD sends you to meet Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

If this sounds unscientific or downright eccentric,.

Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.

Friend once told me that what she fears most about growing old is becoming irrelevant, turning into a nostalgic old woman who cannot understand the world around her, or contribute much to it. This is what we fear collectively, as a species, when we hear of superhumans. We sense that in such a world, our identity, our dreams and even our fears will be irrelevant, and we will have nothing more to contribute. Whatever you are today – be it a devout Hindu cricket player or an aspiring lesbian journalist – in an upgraded world you will feel like a Neanderthal hunter in Wall Street. You won’t belong.

(A famous – and probably apocryphal – anecdote tells of a meeting in 1923 between Nobel Prize laureate Anatole France and the beautiful and talented dancer Isadora Duncan. Discussing the then popular eugenics movement, Duncan said, ‘Just imagine a child with my beauty and your brains!’ France responded, ‘Yes, but imagine a child with my beauty and your brains.’).

Only once the last sword is beaten into a ploughshare should we turn our minds to the next big thing.

In the middle of the nineteenth century Karl Marx reached brilliant economic insights. Based on these insights he predicted an increasingly violent conflict between the proletariat and the capitalists, ending with the inevitable victory of the former and the collapse of the capitalist system. Marx was certain that the revolution would start in countries that spearheaded the Industrial Revolution – such as Britain, France and the USA – and spread to the rest of the world.

Today our knowledge is increasing at breakneck speed, and theoretically we should understand the world better and better. But the very opposite is happening. Our new-found knowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is happening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater upheavals.

Consequently we are less and less able to make sense of the present or forecast the future. In.

Similarly, historians are asked to examine the actions of our ancestors so that we can repeat their wise decisions and avoid their mistakes.

Stone Age hunter-gatherers did not cultivate grass at the entrance to their caves. No green meadow welcomed the visitors to the Athenian Acropolis, the Roman Capitol, the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem or the Forbidden City in Beijing. The idea of nurturing a lawn at the entrance to private residences and public buildings was born in the castles of French and English aristocrats in the late Middle Ages. In the early modern age this habit struck deep roots, and became the trademark of nobility. Well-kept lawns demanded land and a lot of work, particularly in the days before lawnmowers and automatic water sprinklers. In exchange, they produce nothing of value. You can’t even graze animals on them, because they would eat and trample the grass. Poor peasants could not afford wasting precious land or time on lawns. The neat turf at the entrance to chateaux was accordingly a status symbol nobody could fake. It boldly proclaimed to every passerby: ‘I am so rich and powerful, and I have so many acres and serfs, that I can afford this green extravaganza.’ The bigger and neater the lawn, the more powerful the dynasty. If you came to visit a duke and saw that his lawn was in bad shape, you knew he was in trouble.

This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies.

You want to know how super-intelligent cyborgs might treat ordinary flesh-and-blood humans? Better start by investigating how humans treat their less intelligent animal cousins. It’s not a perfect analogy, of course, but it is the best archetype we can actually observe rather than just imagine.

Maybe the collapse of humanism will also be beneficial. People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.

Spending three years in college has absolutely no impact on these views.

The literal meaning of the word ‘individual’ is ‘something that cannot be divided’. That I am an ‘in-dividual’ implies that my true self is a holistic entity rather than an assemblage of separate parts.

Despite the vast knowledge we have gained in the fields of mathematics and computer science, none of the data-processing systems we have created needs subjective experiences in order to function, and none feels pain, pleasure, anger or love.5.

The best test that scholars have so far come up with is called the Turing Test, but it examines only social conventions.

Thus Rome conquered Greece not because the Romans had larger brains or better toolmaking techniques, but because they were able to cooperate more effectively.

‘Ceauşescu’s last speech’,.

Stone Age package: On day one we will hike for ten hours in a pristine forest, setting camp for the night in a clearing by a river. On day two we will canoe down the river for ten hours, camping on the shores of a small lake. On day three we will learn from the native people how to fish in the lake and how to find mushrooms in the nearby woods. Modern proletarian package: On day one we will work for ten hours in a polluted textile factory, passing the night in a cramped apartment block. On day two we will work for ten hours as cashiers in the local department store, going back to sleep in the same apartment block. On day three we will learn from the native people how to open a bank account and fill out mortgage forms. Which package would you choose?.

History isn’t a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives.

History isn’t a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives. Whenever we choose to tell one, we are also choosing to silence others.

How do you know if an entity is real? Very simple – just ask yourself, ‘Can it suffer?’ When people burn down the temple of Zeus, Zeus doesn’t suffer. When the euro loses its value, the euro doesn’t suffer. When a bank goes bankrupt, the bank doesn’t suffer. When a country suffers a defeat in war, the country doesn’t really suffer. It’s just a metaphor. In contrast, when a soldier is wounded in battle, he really does suffer. When a famished peasant has nothing to eat, she suffers. When a cow is separated from her newborn calf, she suffers. This is reality.

The cause of war is fictional, but the suffering is 100 per cent real.

It is often said that God helps those who help themselves. This is a roundabout way of saying that God doesn’t exist, but if our belief in Him inspires us to do something ourselves – it helps.

It is often said that God helps those who help themselves. This is a roundabout way of saying that God doesn’t exist, but if our belief in Him inspires us to do something ourselves – it helps. Antibiotics, unlike God, help even those who don’t help themselves. They cure infections whether you believe in them or not.

Thanks to computers and bioengineering, the difference between fiction and reality will blur, as people reshape reality to match their pet fictions.

We always believe in ‘the truth’. It’s only other people who believe in superstitions.

Modern physicians blame disease on invisible germs, and voodoo priests blame disease on invisible demons. There’s nothing supernatural about it: you make some demon angry, so the demon enters your body and causes you pain.

‘Dad, why shouldn’t we eat pork?’ The father strokes his long white beard thoughtfully and answers, ‘Well, Yankele, that’s how the world works. You are still young and you don’t understand, but if we eat pork, God will punish us and we will come to a bad end. It isn’t my idea. It’s not even the rabbi’s idea. If the rabbi had created the world, maybe he would have created a world in which pork was perfectly kosher. But the rabbi didn’t create the world – God did it. And God said, I don’t know why, that we shouldn’t eat pork. So we shouldn’t. Capeesh?’ In 1943 a German boy comes to his father, a senior SS officer, and asks, ‘Dad, why are we killing the Jews?’ The father puts on his shiny leather boots, and meanwhile explains, ‘Well, Fritz, that’s how the world works. You are still young and you don’t understand, but if we allow the Jews to live, they will cause the degeneration and extinction of humankind. It’s not my idea, and it’s not even the Führer’s idea. If Hitler had created the world, maybe he would have created a world in which the laws of natural selection did not apply, and Jews and Aryans could all live together in perfect harmony. But Hitler didn’t create the world. He just managed to decipher the laws of nature, and then instructed us how to live in line with them. If we disobey these laws, we will come to a bad end. Is that clear?!’.

In fact, it means only that they believe in some system of moral laws that wasn’t invented by humans,.

In fact, it means only that they believe in some system of moral laws that wasn’t invented by humans, but which humans must nevertheless obey.

Thus in medieval Europe the Catholic Church argued that God doesn’t like rich people. Jesus said that it is harder for a rich man to pass through the gates of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, and the Church encouraged the rich to give lots of alms, threatening that misers will burn in hell.

Religion is a deal, whereas spirituality is a journey.

Academic studies might be transformed into a spiritual journey if the big questions you encounter on the way deflect you towards unexpected destinations, of which you could hardly even conceive at first. For example, a student might begin to study economics in order to secure a job in Wall Street. However, if what she learns somehow causes her to end up in a Hindu ashram or helping HIV patients in Zimbabwe, then we might call that a spiritual journey.

That’s what humans are – a good spiritual soul trapped inside an evil material body.

That’s what humans are – a good spiritual soul trapped inside an evil material body. Since the soul’s prison – the body – decays and eventually dies, Satan ceaselessly tempts the soul with bodily delights, and above all with food, sex and power.

‘If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.’.

‘If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.’ Which means that if while walking on the spiritual path you encounter the rigid ideas and fixed laws of institutionalised Buddhism, you must free yourself from them too.

Dominican friar Johannes Tetzel, allegedly said that the moment the coin clinks in the money.

Harris thinks all humans share a single supreme value – minimising suffering and maximising happiness – and all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise happiness.

Harris thinks all humans share a single supreme value – minimising suffering and maximising happiness – and all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise happiness.5 Islamic fundamentalists want to reach heaven in order to be happy, liberals believe that increasing human liberty maximises happiness, and German nationalists think that everyone would be better off if they only allowed Berlin to run this planet. According to Harris, Islamists, liberals and nationalists have no ethical dispute; they have a factual disagreement about how best to realise their common goal.

Indeed, are happiness and misery mathematical entities that can be added or subtracted in the first place? Eating ice cream is enjoyable. Finding true love is more enjoyable. Do you think that if you just eat enough ice cream, the accumulated pleasure could ever equal the rapture of true love?.

Hence you cannot understand the history of science without taking religious beliefs into account. Scientists seldom dwell on this fact, but the Scientific Revolution itself began in one of the most dogmatic, intolerant and religious societies in history.

If you travelled to Cairo or Istanbul around 1600, you would find there a multicultural and tolerant metropolis, where Sunnis, Shiites, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Armenians, Copts, Jews and even the occasional Hindu lived side by side in relative harmony. Though they had their share of disagreements and riots, and though the Ottoman Empire routinely discriminated against people on religious grounds, it was a liberal paradise compared with Europe.

In London they killed Catholics, in Paris they killed Protestants, the Jews had long been driven out, and nobody in his right mind would dream of letting any Muslims in.

Religion is interested above all in order. It aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science is interested above all in power. It aims to acquire the power to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food.

Religion is interested above all in order. It aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science is interested above all in power. It aims to acquire the power to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food. As individuals, scientists and priests may give immense importance to the truth; but as collective institutions, science and religion prefer order and power over truth. They can therefore make good bedfellows. The uncompromising quest for truth is a spiritual journey, which can seldom remain within the confines of either religious or scientific establishments.

On the other hand, if shit just happens, without any binding script or purpose, then humans too are not limited to any predetermined role. We can do anything we want – provided we can find a way. We are constrained by nothing except our own ignorance. Plagues and droughts have no cosmic meaning – but we can eradicate them. Wars are not a necessary evil on the way to a better future – but we can make peace. No paradise awaits us after death – but we can create paradise here on earth, and live in it for ever, if we just manage.

Omnipotence is in front of us, almost within our reach, but below us yawns the abyss of complete nothingness.

Omnipotence is in front of us, almost within our reach, but below us yawns the abyss of complete nothingness. On the practical level, modern life consists of a constant pursuit of power within a universe devoid of meaning. Modern culture is the most powerful in history, and it is ceaselessly researching, inventing, discovering and growing. At the same time, it is plagued by more.

If you want provisions – you must pay cash. But how can you have enough money when you haven’t discovered the medicine yet, and all your time is taken up with research?.

Credit is the economic manifestation of trust.

Evolutionary pressures have accustomed humans to see the world as a static pie. If somebody gets a bigger slice of the pie, somebody else inevitably gets a smaller slice. A particular family or city may prosper, but humankind as a whole is not going to produce more than it produces today.

Prayers, good deeds and meditation can be comforting and inspiring, but problems such as famine, plague and war can only be solved through growth. This fundamental dogma can be summarised in one simple idea: ‘If you have a problem, you probably need more stuff, and in order to have more stuff, you must produce more of.

Prayers, good deeds and meditation can be comforting and inspiring, but problems such as famine, plague and war can only be solved through growth. This fundamental dogma can be summarised in one simple idea: ‘If you have a problem, you probably need more stuff, and in order to have more stuff, you must produce more of it.’.

Firstly, when we produce more, we can consume more, raise our standard of living and allegedly enjoy a happier life.

For example, in India the annual population growth rate is 1.2 per cent. That means that unless the Indian economy grows each year by at least 1.2 per cent, unemployment will rise, salaries will fall and the average standard of living will decline.

And in the case of the disgruntled couple, their marriage will be saved if they just buy a bigger house (so they don’t have to share a cramped office), purchase a dishwasher (so that they stop arguing whose turn it is to do the dishes) and go to expensive therapy sessions twice a week.

Just as Christians and Muslims both believed in heaven, and disagreed only about how to get there, so during the Cold War both capitalists and communists believed in creating heaven on earth through economic growth, and wrangled only about the exact method.

Meanwhile in neighbouring China the Communist Party still pays lip service to traditional Marxist–Leninist ideals, but in practice it is guided by Deng Xiaoping’s famous maxims that ‘development is the only hard truth’ and that ‘it doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice’. Which means, in plain language: do anything it takes to promote economic growth, even if Marx and Lenin wouldn’t have been happy with it.

In Singapore, as befits that no-nonsense city state, they followed this line of thinking even further, and pegged ministerial salaries to the national GDP. When the Singaporean economy grows, ministers get a raise, as if that is what their job is all about.

The credo of ‘more stuff’ accordingly urges individuals, firms and governments to discount anything that might hamper economic growth, such as preserving social equality, ensuring ecological harmony or honouring your parents. In the Soviet Union, when people thought that state-controlled communism was the fastest way to grow, anything that stood in the way of collectivisation was bulldozed, including millions of kulaks, the freedom of expression and the Aral Sea. Nowadays it is generally accepted that some version of free-market capitalism is a much more efficient way of ensuring long-term growth, hence rich farmers and freedom of expression are protected, but ecological habitats, social structures and traditional values that stand in the way of free-market capitalism are destroyed and dismantled.

Free-market capitalism has a firm answer. If economic growth demands that we loosen family bonds, encourage people to live away from their parents, and import carers from the other side of the world – so be it.

Thou shalt invest thy profits in increasing growth. For most of history princes and priests wasted their profits on flamboyant carnivals, sumptuous palaces and unnecessary wars. Alternatively, they put gold coins in an iron chest, sealed it and buried it in a dungeon. Today, devout capitalists use their profits to hire new employees, enlarge the factory or develop a new product.

‘The banks offer such low interest rates,’ he would complain. ‘I don’t want to put my money in a savings account that pays hardly 0.5 per cent a year. You can make perhaps 2 per cent in government bonds. My cousin Richie bought a flat in Seattle last year, and he has already made 20 per cent on his investment! Maybe I should go into real estate too; but everybody is saying there’s a new real-estate bubble. So what do you think about the stock exchange? A friend told me the best deal these days is to buy an ETF that follows emerging economies, like Brazil or China.’ As he stops for a moment to breathe, you ask, ‘Well, why not just be satisfied with your $100,000?’ He will explain to you better than I can why capitalism will never stop.

The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance.

For thousands of years, the scientific road to growth was blocked because people believed that holy scriptures and ancient traditions already contained all the important knowledge the world had to offer. A corporation that believed all the oil fields in the world had already been discovered would not waste time and money searching for oil. Similarly, a human culture that believed it already knew everything worth knowing would not bother searching for new knowledge. This was the position of most premodern human civilisations. However, the Scientific Revolution freed humankind from this conviction. The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realised how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress.

Beijing has already become so polluted that people avoid the outdoors, and wealthy Chinese pay thousands of dollars for indoor air-purifying systems. The super-rich build protective contraptions even over their yards. In 2013 the International School of Beijing, which caters for the children of foreign diplomats and upper-class Chinese, went a step further, and constructed a giant $5 million dome over its six tennis courts and its playing fields. Other schools are following suit, and the Chinese air-purification market is booming. Of course most Beijing residents cannot afford such luxuries in their homes, nor can they afford to send their kids to the International School.

Why aren’t they protesting? If and when the deluge.

The modern deal, which we have all signed up to on the day we were born. In the premodern world, people were akin to lowly clerks in a socialist bureaucracy. They punched their card, and then waited for somebody else to do something. In the modern world, we humans run the business. So.

Capitalist thinkers repeatedly calm us: ‘Don’t worry, it will be okay. Provided the economy grows, the invisible hand of the market will take care of everything else.’ Capitalism has thus sanctified a voracious.

We are not actors in a divine drama, and nobody cares about us and our deeds, so nobody sets limits to our power – but we are still convinced our lives have meaning.

According to humanism, humans must draw from within their inner experiences not only the meaning of their own lives, but also the meaning of the entire universe.

According to humanism, humans must draw from within their inner experiences not only the meaning of their own lives, but also the meaning of the entire universe. This is the primary commandment humanism has given us: create meaning for a meaningless world.

Accordingly, the central religious revolution of modernity was not losing faith.

Accordingly, the central religious revolution of modernity was not losing faith in God; rather, it was gaining faith in humanity.

‘Listen to yourself, follow your heart, be true to yourself, trust yourself, do what feels good.’.

‘Listen to yourself, follow your heart, be true to yourself, trust yourself, do what feels good.’ Jean-Jacques Rousseau summed it all up in his novel Émile, the eighteenth-century bible of feeling.

Note that the Syndicate did not blame the magazine for disobeying God’s will. That’s what we call progress.

Yet how does the voter know what to choose? Theoretically at least, the voter is supposed to consult his or her innermost feelings, and follow their lead. It is not always easy. In order to get in touch with my feelings, I need to filter out the empty propaganda slogans, the endless lies of ruthless politicians, the distracting noise created by cunning spin doctors, and the learned opinions of hired pundits. I need to ignore all this racket, and attend only to my authentic inner voice. And then my authentic inner voice whispers in my ear ‘Vote Cameron’ or ‘Vote Modi’ or ‘Vote Clinton’ or whomever, and I put a cross against that name on the ballot paper – and that’s how we know who should rule the country.

The very definition of art is consequently up for grabs. In 1917 Marcel Duchamp took an ordinary mass-produced urinal, named it Fountain, signed his name at the bottom, declared it a work of art and placed it in a Paris museum. Medieval people would not have bothered to even argue about it. Why waste oxygen on such utter nonsense? Yet in the modern humanist world, Duchamp’s work is considered an important artistic milestone. In countless classrooms across the world, first-year art students are shown an image of Duchamp’s Fountain, and at a sign from the teacher, all hell breaks loose. It is art! No it isn’t! Yes it is! No way! After letting the students release some steam, the teacher focuses the discussion by asking ‘What exactly is art? And how do we determine whether something is a work of art or not?’ After a few more minutes of back and forth, the teacher steers the class in the right direction: ‘Art is anything people think is art, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.’ If people think that a urinal is a beautiful work of art – then it is. What higher authority is there that can tell people they are wrong? Today, copies of Duchamp’s masterpiece are presented in some of the most important museums in the world, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Canada, the Tate Gallery in London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. (The copies are placed in the museums’ showrooms, not in the lavatories.).

‘Everything comes back to the individual customer and to the question how much the customer is willing to pay for meat . . . we must remember that it would be impossible to maintain current levels of global meat consumption without the [enhanced] modern chicken . . . if customers ask us only for the cheapest meat possible – that’s what the customers will get . . .

Customers need to decide what is most important to them – price, or something else.’3.

In contrast, modern humanist education believes in teaching students to think for themselves. It is good to know what Aristotle, Solomon and Aquinas thought about politics, art and economics; yet since the supreme source of meaning and authority lies within ourselves, it is far more important to know what you think about these matters. Ask a teacher – whether in kindergarten, school or college – what she is trying to teach. ‘Well,’ she will answer, ‘I teach the kids history, or quantum physics, or art – but above all I try to teach them to think for themselves.’ It may not always succeed, but that is what humanist education seeks to do.

Humanism assumes that each human has a single authentic inner self, but when I try to listen to it, I often encounter either silence or a cacophony of contending voices.

The scientific formula for knowledge led to astounding breakthroughs in astronomy, physics, medicine and countless other disciplines. But it had one huge drawback: it could not deal with questions of value and meaning.

Scientists could not come up with such ethical judgements.

Rather, an experience is a subjective phenomenon that includes three main ingredients: sensations, emotions and thoughts.

Take tea, for example. I start by drinking very sweet ordinary tea while reading the morning paper. The tea is little more than an excuse for a sugar rush. One day I realise that between the sugar and the newspaper, I hardly taste the tea at all. So I reduce the amount of sugar, put the paper aside, close my eyes and focus on the tea itself. I begin to register its unique aroma and flavour. Soon I find myself experimenting with different teas, black and green, comparing their exquisite tangs and delicate bouquets. Within a few months, I drop the supermarket labels and buy my tea at Harrods. I develop a particular liking for ‘Panda Dung tea’ from the mountains of Ya’an in Sichuan province, made from leaves of tea trees fertilised by the dung of panda bears. That’s how, one cup at a time, I hone my tea sensitivity and become a tea connoisseur. If in my early tea-drinking days you had served me Panda Dung tea in a Ming Dynasty porcelain goblet, I would not have appreciated it much more than builder’s tea in a paper cup. You cannot experience something if you don’t have the necessary sensitivity, and you cannot develop your sensitivity except by undergoing a long string of experiences.

As we pass through life, we hurt people and people hurt us, we act compassionately and others show compassion to us.

As we pass through life, we hurt people and people hurt us, we act compassionately and others show compassion to us. If we pay attention, our moral sensitivity sharpens, and these experiences become a source of valuable ethical knowledge about what is good, what is right and who I really am.

Humanism thus sees life as a gradual process of inner change, leading from ignorance to enlightenment by means of experiences. The highest aim of humanist life is to fully develop your knowledge through a large variety of intellectual, emotional and physical experiences. In the early nineteenth century, Wilhelm von Humboldt – one of the chief architects of the modern education system – said that the aim of existence is ‘a distillation of the widest possible experience of life into wisdom’. He also wrote that ‘there is only one summit in life – to have taken the measure in feeling of everything human’.4 This could well be the humanist motto.

The yang provides us with power, while the yin provides us with meaning and ethical judgements.

This is what the Tin Man does in The Wizard of Oz.

If they lived among us, we would send them to a therapist, who might help them get in touch with themselves. This is what the Tin Man does in The Wizard of Oz. He walks along the yellow brick road with Dorothy and her friends, hoping that when they get to Oz, the great wizard will give him a heart, while the Scarecrow wants a brain and the Lion wants courage. At the end of their journey they discover that the great wizard is a charlatan, and he can’t give them any of these things. But they discover something far more important: everything they wish for is already within themselves. There is no need of some godlike wizard in order to obtain sensitivity, wisdom or bravery. You just need to follow the yellow brick road, and open yourself to whatever experiences come your way.

Today we might think of medieval knights as insensitive brutes. If they lived among us, we would send them to a therapist, who might help them get in touch with themselves.

War novels such as All Quiet on the Western Front and war films such as Platoon begin with a young and naïve recruit, who knows little about himself and the world, but carries a heavy burden of hopes and illusions. He believes that war is glorious, our cause is just and the general is a genius. A few weeks of real war – of mud, and blood, and the smell of death – shatter his illusions one after another. If he survives, the naïve recruit will leave war as a much wiser man, who no longer believes the clichés and ideals peddled by teachers, film-makers and eloquent politicians. Paradoxically, this narrative has become so influential that today it is told over and over again even by teachers, film-makers and eloquent politicians. ‘War is not what you see in the movies!’ warn Hollywood blockbusters such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Blackhawk Down. Enshrined in celluloid, prose or poetry, the feelings of the ordinary grunt have become the ultimate authority on war, which everyone has learned to respect. As the joke goes, ‘How many Vietnam vets does it take to change a light bulb?’ ‘You wouldn’t know, you weren’t there.’.

If you want to understand war, don’t look up at the general on the hilltop, or at angels in the sky. Instead, look straight into the eyes of the common soldiers.

A Catholic soldier fighting at the Battle of White Mountain could say to himself: ‘True, I am suffering. But the Pope and the emperor say that we are fighting for a good cause, so my suffering is meaningful.’ Otto Dix employed an opposite kind of logic. He saw personal experience as the source of all meaning, hence his line of thinking said: ‘I am suffering – and this is bad – hence the whole war is bad. And if the kaiser and the clergy nevertheless support the war, they must be mistaken.’.

Every human being is a singular ray of light, which illuminates the world from a different perspective, and which adds colour, depth and meaning to the universe.

The orthodox branch holds that each human being is a unique individual possessing a distinctive inner voice and a never-to-be-repeated string of experiences. Every human being is a singular ray of light, which illuminates the world from a different perspective, and which adds colour, depth and meaning to the universe. Hence we ought to give as much freedom as possible to every individual to experience the world, follow his or her inner voice and express his or her inner truth. Whether in politics, economics or art, individual free will should have far more weight than state interests or religious doctrines. The more liberty individuals enjoy, the more beautiful, rich and meaningful is the world. Due to this emphasis on liberty, the orthodox branch of humanism is known as ‘liberal humanism’ or simply as ‘liberalism’.

Liberal art holds that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Liberal economics maintains that the customer is always right. Liberal ethics advises us that if it feels good, we should go ahead and do it. Liberal education teaches us to think for ourselves,.

That’s why socialists discourage self-exploration, and advocate the establishment of strong collective institutions – such as socialist parties and trade unions – that aim to decipher the world for us. Whereas in liberal politics the voter knows best, and in liberal economics the customer is always right, in socialist politics the party knows best, and in socialist economics the trade union is always right. Authority and meaning still come from human experience – both the party and the trade union are composed of people and work to alleviate human misery – yet individuals must listen to the party and the trade union rather than to their personal feelings.

Nietzsche summed it up by saying that war is ‘the school of life’ and that ‘what does not kill me makes me stronger’.

Khrushchev, confidently told the liberal West that ‘Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury.

‘Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury.

‘Whether you like it.

Or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!’.

India was the only important Third World country that committed to the liberal path after securing its independence, but even India distanced itself from the Western bloc, and leaned towards the Soviets.

Liberal democracy was saved only by nuclear weapons.

Liberal democracy was saved only by nuclear weapons. NATO adopted the doctrine of MAD (mutual assured destruction), according to which even conventional Soviet attacks would be answered by an all-out nuclear strike. ‘If you attack us,’ threatened the liberals, ‘we will make sure nobody comes out of it alive.’ Behind this monstrous shield, liberal democracy and the free market managed to hold out in their last bastions, and Westerners could enjoy sex, drugs and rock and roll, as well as washing machines, refrigerators and televisions. Without nukes, there would have been no Woodstock, no Beatles and no overflowing supermarkets. But in the mid-1970s it seemed that nuclear weapons notwithstanding, the future belonged to socialism.

Nobody seems to know what the Chinese believe these days – including the Chinese themselves. In theory China is still communist, but in practice it is nothing of the kind.

‘Communism is power to worker councils,’ he said, ‘plus electrification of the whole country.’ There can be no communism without electricity, without railroads, without radio. You couldn’t establish a communist regime in sixteenth-century Russia, because communism necessitates the concentration of information and resources in one hub. ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs’ only works when produce can easily be collected and distributed across vast distances, and when activities can be monitored and coordinated over entire countries.

If Marx came back to life today, he would probably urge his few remaining disciples to devote less time to reading Das Kapital and more time to studying the Internet and the human genome.

Islam, Christianity and other traditional religions are still important players in the world. Yet their role is now largely reactive.

Ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of the twentieth century? That’s a difficult question, because it is hard to choose from a long list of candidates, including scientific discoveries such as antibiotics, technological inventions such as computers, and ideological creations such as feminism. Now ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of traditional religions such as Islam and Christianity in the twentieth century? This too is a very difficult question, because there is so little to choose from. What did priests, rabbis and muftis discover in the twentieth century that can be mentioned in the same breath as antibiotics, computers or feminism? Having mulled over these two questions, from where do you think the big changes of the twenty-first century will emerge: from the Islamic State, or from Google? Yes, the Islamic State knows how to put videos on YouTube; but leaving aside the industry of torture, how many new start-ups have emerged from Syria or Iraq lately?.

Yet Christian true-believers – however progressive – cannot admit to drawing their ethics from Foucault and Haraway. So they go back to the Bible, to St Augustine and to Martin Luther, and make a very thorough search. They read page after page and story after story with the utmost attention, until they find what they need: some maxim, parable or ruling that if interpreted creatively enough means that God blesses gay marriages and that women can be ordained to the priesthood. They then pretend the idea originated in the Bible, when in fact it originated with Foucault. The Bible is kept as a source of authority, even though it is no longer a true source of inspiration.

The whole universe is pegged to the human experience, what will happen once the human experience becomes just another designable product, no different in essence from any other item in the supermarket?.

Because science does not deal with questions of value, it cannot determine whether liberals are right in valuing liberty more than equality, or in valuing the individual more than the collective.

‘He did it due to such-and-such electrochemical processes in the brain, which were shaped by a particular genetic make-up, which reflect ancient evolutionary pressures coupled with chance mutations.’.

Free will exists only in the imaginary stories we humans have invented.

Randomly or freely. It may sound extremely complicated, but it is surprisingly easy to test this idea. Next time a thought pops up in your mind, stop and ask yourself: ‘Why did I think this particular thought? Did I decide a minute ago to think this thought, and only then did I think it? Or did it just arise in my mind, without my permission or instruction? If I am indeed the master of my thoughts and decisions, can I decide not to think about anything at all for the next sixty seconds?’ Just try, and see what happens.

Some of those voices repeat society’s prejudices, some echo our personal history, and some articulate our genetic legacy. All of them together, says Sally, create an invisible story that shapes our conscious decisions in ways we seldom grasp. What would happen if we could rewrite our inner monologues, or even silence them completely on occasion?.

To be an individual means that I am in-dividual.

The single authentic self is as real as the eternal Christian soul, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.

The single authentic self is as real as the eternal Christian soul, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny. If you look really deep within yourself, the seeming unity that we take for granted dissolves into a cacophony of conflicting voices, none of which is ‘my true self’. Humans aren’t individuals. They are ‘dividuals’.

The experiencing self is our moment-to-moment consciousness. For the experiencing self, it’s obvious that the ‘long’ part of the cold-water experiment was worse. First you experience water at 14°C for sixty seconds, which is every bit as bad as what you experience in the ‘short’ part, and then you must endure another thirty seconds of water at 15°C,.

It is forever busy spinning yarns about the past and making plans for the future.

It is forever busy spinning yarns about the past and making plans for the future. Like every journalist, poet and politician, the narrating self takes many short cuts. It doesn’t narrate everything, and usually weaves the story only from peak moments and end results. The value of the whole experience is determined by averaging peaks with ends.

We experience hunger differently when we fast on Ramadan, when we fast in preparation for a medical examination, and when we don’t eat because we have no money. The different meanings ascribed to our hunger by the narrating.

Borges asks a fundamental question about the human condition: what happens when the yarns spun by our narrating self cause great harm to ourselves or those around us?.

Borges asks a fundamental question about the human condition: what happens when the yarns spun by our narrating self cause great harm to ourselves or those around us? There are three main possibilities, says Borges. One option is that nothing much happens. Don Quixote will not be bothered at all by killing a real man. His delusions are so overpowering that he could not tell the difference between this incident and his imaginary duel with the windmill giants. Another option is that once he takes a real life, Don Quixote will be so horrified that he will be shaken out of his delusions. This is akin to a young recruit who goes to war believing that it is good to die for one’s country, only to be completely disillusioned by the realities of warfare. And there is a third option, much more complex and profound. As long as he fought imaginary giants, Don Quixote was just play-acting, but once he actually kills somebody, he will cling to his fantasies for all he is worth, because they are the only thing giving meaning to his terrible crime. Paradoxically, the more sacrifices we make for an imaginary story, the stronger the story becomes, because we desperately want to give meaning to these sacrifices and to the suffering we have caused. In politics this is known as the ‘Our Boys Didn’t Die in Vain’ syndrome.

While it’s hard for a politician to tell parents that their son died for no good reason, it is far more difficult for parents to say this to themselves – and it is even harder for the victims. A crippled soldier who lost his legs would rather tell himself, ‘I sacrificed myself for the glory of the eternal Italian nation!’ than ‘I lost my legs because I was stupid enough to believe self-serving politicians.’ It is much easier to live with the fantasy, because the fantasy gives meaning to the suffering.

Priests discovered this principle thousands of years ago. It underlies numerous religious ceremonies and commandments. If you want to make people believe in imaginary entities such as gods and nations, you should make them sacrifice something valuable. The more painful the sacrifice, the more convinced people are of the existence of the imaginary recipient. A poor peasant sacrificing a priceless bull to Jupiter will become convinced that Jupiter really exists, otherwise how can he excuse his stupidity? The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he won’t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted.

Own paralysis have been completely pointless. Few.

Zealous Italian nationalist or an enthusiastic communist. For if Italian national myths or communist propaganda are a lie, then I will be forced to admit that my child’s death or my own paralysis have been completely pointless. Few.

The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he won’t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted. For exactly the same reason, if I have sacrificed a child to the glory of the Italian nation, or my legs to the communist revolution, it’s enough to turn me into a zealous Italian nationalist or an enthusiastic communist. For if Italian national myths or communist propaganda are a lie, then I will be forced to admit that my child’s death or my own paralysis have been completely pointless. Few people have the stomach to admit such a thing.

Eventually, if we want to come clean about past mistakes, our narrating self must invent some twist in the plot that will infuse these mistakes with meaning. For example, a pacifist war veteran may tell himself, ‘Yes, I’ve lost my legs because of a mistake. But thanks to this mistake, I understand that war is hell, and from now onwards I will dedicate my life to fight for peace. So my injury did have some positive meaning: it taught me to value peace.’.

Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we saw, novels we read, speeches we heard, and from our own daydreams, and weaves out of all that jumble a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from and where I am going.

This story tells me what to love, whom to hate and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that’s what the plot requires. We all have our genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all just stories.

Liberalism maintains that we shouldn’t expect an external entity to provide us with some readymade meaning. Rather, each individual voter, customer and viewer ought to use his or her free will in order to create meaning not just for his or her life, but for the entire universe.

What, then, is the meaning of life? Liberalism maintains that we shouldn’t expect an external entity to provide us with some readymade meaning. Rather, each individual voter, customer and viewer ought to use his or her free will in order to create meaning not just for his or her life, but for the entire universe. The life sciences undermine liberalism, arguing that the free individual is just a fictional tale concocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms. Every moment, the biochemical mechanisms of the brain create a flash of experience, which immediately disappears. Then more flashes appear and fade, appear and fade, in quick succession. These momentary experiences do not add up to any enduring essence. The narrating self tries to impose order on this chaos by spinning a never-ending story, in which every such experience has its place, and hence every experience has some lasting meaning.

But, as convincing and tempting as it may be, this story is a fiction. Medieval crusaders believed that God and heaven provided their lives with meaning. Modern liberals believe that individual free choices provide life with meaning. They are all equally delusional.

Thinkers in India, China and Greece argued that ‘the individual self is an illusion’ more than 2,000 years ago. Yet such doubts don’t really change history unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament. Just as Christianity didn’t disappear the day Darwin published On the Origin of Species, so liberalism won’t vanish just because scientists have reached the conclusion that there are no free individuals.

We are about to face a flood of extremely useful devices, tools and structures that make no allowance for the free will of individual humans. Can democracy, the free market and human rights survive this flood?.

Humans are in danger of losing their value, because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.

Gods can possess land and employ people, why not algorithms?.

Professor Steve Larson from the University of Oregon sent Cope a challenge for a musical showdown. Larson suggested that professional pianists play three pieces one after the other: one by Bach, one by EMI, and one by Larson himself. The audience would then be asked to vote who composed which piece. Larson was convinced people would easily tell the difference between soulful human compositions, and the lifeless artefact of a machine. Cope accepted the challenge. On the appointed date, hundreds of lecturers, students and music fans assembled in the University of Oregon’s concert hall. At the end of the performance, a vote was taken. The result? The audience thought that EMI’s piece was genuine Bach, that Bach’s piece was composed by Larson, and that Larson’s piece was produced by a computer.

In the twenty-first century we might witness the creation of a new massive class: people devoid of any economic, political or even artistic value, who contribute nothing to the prosperity, power and glory of society.

The likelihood that computer algorithms will displace archaeologists by 2033 is only 0.7 per cent, because their job requires highly sophisticated types of pattern recognition, and doesn’t produce huge profits. Hence it is improbable that corporations or government will make the necessary investment to automate archaeology within the next twenty years.

After all, algorithms might well outperform humans in designing virtual worlds too. The crucial problem isn’t creating new jobs. The crucial problem is creating new jobs that humans perform better than algorithms.

People must do something, or they will go crazy. What will they do all day? One solution might be offered by drugs and computer games. Unnecessary people might spend increasing amounts of time within 3D virtual-reality worlds, which would provide them with far more excitement and emotional engagement than the drab reality outside. Yet such a development would deal a mortal blow to the liberal belief in the sacredness of human life and of human experiences. What’s so sacred in useless bums who pass their days devouring artificial experiences in La La Land?.

Even preprogramming the system with seemingly benign goals might backfire horribly. One popular scenario imagines a corporation designing the first artificial super-intelligence, and giving it an innocent test such as calculating pi. Before anyone realises what is happening, the AI takes over the planet, eliminates the human race, launches a conquest campaign to the ends of the galaxy, and transforms the entire known universe into a giant super-computer that for billions upon billions of years calculates pi ever more accurately. After all, this is the divine mission its Creator gave it.

Liberalism will collapse on the day the system knows me better than I know myself.

Liberalism will collapse on the day the system knows me better than I know myself. Which is less difficult than it may sound, given that most people don’t really know themselves well.

‘People might abandon their own psychological judgements and rely on computers when making important life decisions, such as choosing activities, career paths, or even romantic partners. It is possible that such data-driven decisions will improve people’s lives.’.

And this is just the beginning. Today in the US more people read digital books than printed volumes. Devices such as Amazon’s Kindle are able to collect data on their users while they are reading the book. For example, your Kindle can monitor which parts of the book you read fast, and which slow; on which page you took a break, and on which sentence you abandoned the book, never to pick it up again. (Better tell the author to rewrite that bit.) If Kindle is upgraded with face recognition and biometric sensors, it can know what made you laugh, what made you sad and what made you angry. Soon, books will read you while you are reading them. And whereas you quickly forget most of what you read, Amazon will never forget a thing. Such data will enable Amazon to evaluate the suitability of a book much better than ever before. It will also enable Amazon to know exactly who you are, and how to turn you on and off.

Humanist psychologists have pointed out that people in distress often don’t want a quick fix – they want somebody to listen to them and sympathise with their fears and misgivings. Suppose you are having an ongoing crisis in your workplace, because your new boss doesn’t appreciate your views, and insists on doing everything her way. After one particularly unhappy day, you pick up the phone and call a friend. But the friend has little time and energy for you, so he cuts you short, and tries to solve your problem: ‘Okay. I get it. Well, you really have just two options here: either quit the job, or stay and do what the boss wants. And if I were you, I would quit.’ That would hardly help. A really good friend will have patience, and will not be quick to find a solution. He will listen to your distress, and will provide time and space for all your contradictory emotions and gnawing anxieties to surface. The attention.

He insisted that if an organism acquired some new trait during its lifetime, this quality could pass directly to its descendants. This idea flew in the face of Darwinian orthodoxy, but it dovetailed nicely with communist educational principles. It implied that if you could train wheat plants to withstand cold weather, their progenies will also be cold-resistant. Lysenko accordingly sent billions of counter-revolutionary wheat plants to be re-educated in Siberia – and the Soviet Union was soon forced to import more and more flour from the United States.

Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological changes.

Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm. After all, what’s the advantage of humans over chickens? Only that in humans information flows in much more complex patterns than in chickens. Humans absorb more data, and process it using better algorithms. (In day-to-day language that means that humans allegedly have deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. But remember that according to current biological dogma, emotions and intelligence are just algorithms.) Well then, if we could create a data-processing system that absorbs even more data than a human being, and that processes it even more efficiently, wouldn’t that system be superior to a human in exactly the same way that a human is superior to a chicken?.

Data religion now says that your every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching you and that they care about everything you do and feel.

Twenty years ago Japanese tourists were a universal laughing stock because they always carried cameras and took pictures of everything in sight. Now everyone is doing it. If you go to India and see an elephant, you don’t look at the elephant and ask yourself, ‘What do I feel?’ – you are too busy looking for your smartphone, taking a picture of the elephant, posting it on Facebook and then checking your account every two minutes to see how many Likes you got. Writing a private diary – a common humanist practice in previous generations – sounds to many present-day youngsters utterly pointless. Why write anything if nobody else can read it? The new motto says: ‘If you experience something – record it. If you record something – upload it. If you upload something – share it.’.

Throughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the experiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can write a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the global data-processing system. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf’s experiences – as deep and complex as they may be – are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our experiences into data. It isn’t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival. We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in turning these experiences into free-flowing data.

If we develop an algorithm that fulfils the same function better, human experiences will lose their value. Thus if we can replace not just taxi drivers and doctors but also lawyers, poets and musicians with superior computer programs, why should we care if these programs have no consciousness and no subjective experiences? If some humanist starts adulating the sacredness of human experience, Dataists would dismiss such sentimental humbug. ‘The experience you praise is just an outdated biochemical algorithm. In the African savannah 70,000 years ago, that algorithm was state-of-the-art. Even in the twentieth century it was vital for the army and for the economy. But soon we will have much better algorithms.’.

In ancient Babylon, when people faced a difficult dilemma they climbed to the top of the local temple in the darkness of night and observed the sky. The Babylonians believed that the stars control our fate and predict our future. By watching the stars the Babylonians decided whether to get married, plough the field and go to war. Their philosophical beliefs were.

The Babylonians believed that the stars control our fate and predict our future. By watching the stars the Babylonians decided whether to get married, plough the field and go to war. Their philosophical beliefs were translated into very practical procedures.

Scriptural religions such as Judaism and Christianity told a different story: ‘The stars are lying. God, who created the stars, revealed the entire truth in the Bible. So stop observing the stars – read the Bible instead!’ This too was a practical recommendation. When people didn’t know whom to marry, what career to choose and whether to start a war, they read the Bible and followed its counsel.

Next came the humanists, with an altogether new story: ‘Humans invented God, wrote the Bible and then interpreted it in a thousand different ways. So humans themselves are the source of all truth. You may read the Bible as an inspiring human creation, but you don’t have to. If you are facing any dilemma, just listen to yourself and follow your inner voice.’ Humanism then gave detailed practical instructions on how to listen to yourself, recommending things such as watching sunsets, reading Goethe, keeping a private diary, having heart-to-heart talks with a good friend and holding democratic elections. For centuries scientists too accepted these humanist guidelines. When physicists wondered whether to get married or not, they too watched sunsets and tried to get in touch with themselves. When chemists contemplated whether to accept a problematic job offer, they too wrote diaries and had heart-to-heart talks with a good friend. When biologists debated whether to wage war or sign a peace treaty, they too voted in democratic elections. When brain scientists wrote books about their startling discoveries, they often put an inspiring Goethe quote on the first page. This was the basis for the modern alliance between science and humanism, which kept the delicate balance between the modern yang and the modern yin – between reason and emotion, between the laboratory and the museum, between.

Next came the humanists, with an altogether new story: ‘Humans invented God, wrote the Bible and then interpreted it in a thousand different ways. So humans themselves are the source of all truth. You may read the Bible as an inspiring human creation, but you don’t have to. If you are facing any dilemma, just listen to yourself and follow your inner voice.’ Humanism then gave detailed practical instructions on how to listen to yourself, recommending things such as watching sunsets, reading Goethe, keeping a private diary, having heart-to-heart talks with a good friend and holding democratic elections. For centuries scientists too accepted these humanist guidelines. When physicists wondered whether to get married or not, they too watched sunsets and tried to get in touch with themselves. When chemists contemplated whether to accept a problematic job offer, they too wrote diaries and had heart-to-heart talks with a good friend. When biologists debated whether to wage war or sign a peace treaty, they too voted in democratic elections. When brain scientists wrote books about their startling discoveries, they often put an inspiring Goethe quote on the first page. This was the basis for the modern alliance between science and humanism, which kept the delicate balance between the modern yang and the modern yin – between reason and emotion, between the laboratory and the museum, between the production line and the supermarket.

The Google and Facebook algorithms not only know exactly how you feel, they also know a million other things about you that you hardly suspect.

The Google and Facebook algorithms not only know exactly how you feel, they also know a million other things about you that you hardly suspect. Consequently you should now stop listening to your feelings, and start listening to these external algorithms instead. What’s the use of having democratic elections when the algorithms know how each person is going to vote, and when they also know the exact neurological reasons why one person votes Democrat while another votes Republican? Whereas humanism commanded: ‘Listen to your feelings!’ Dataism now commands: ‘Listen to the algorithms! They know how you feel.’ When you contemplate whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war, Dataism tells you it would be a total waste of time to climb a high mountain and watch the sun setting on the waves. It would be equally pointless to go to a museum, write a private diary or have a heart-to-heart talk with a friend. Yes, in order to make the right decisions you must get to know yourself better. But if you want to know yourself in the twenty-first century, there are much better methods than climbing mountains, going to museums or writing diaries. Here are some practical Dataist guidelines for you: ‘You want to know who you really are?’ asks Dataism. ‘Then forget about mountains and museums. Have you had your DNA sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today. And convince your grandparents, parents and siblings to have their DNA sequenced too – their data is very valuable for you. And have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that measure your blood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a day? Good – so buy one of those, put it on and connect it to your smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera and microphone, record everything you do, and put in online. And allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails, monitor all your chats and messages, and keep a record of all your Likes and clicks. If you do all that, then the great algorithms of the Internet-of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war.’.

Yet the really important algorithms – such as the Google search algorithm – are developed by huge teams. Each member understands just one part of the puzzle, and nobody really understands the algorithm as a whole. Moreover, with the rise of machine learning and artificial neural networks, more and more algorithms evolve independently, improving themselves and learning from their own mistakes. They analyse astronomical amounts of data, which no human can possibly encompass, and learn to recognise patterns and adopt strategies that escape the human mind. The seed algorithm may initially be developed by humans, but as it grows, it follows its own path, going where no human has gone before – and where no human can follow.

But maybe we’ll discover that organisms aren’t algorithms after.

But maybe we’ll discover that organisms aren’t algorithms after all.

A critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge of the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project. Scholars in the life sciences and social sciences should ask themselves whether we miss anything when we understand life as data processing and decision-making. Is there perhaps something in the universe that cannot be reduced to data? Suppose non-conscious algorithms could eventually outperform conscious intelligence in all known data-processing tasks – what, if anything, would be lost by replacing conscious intelligence with superior non-conscious algorithms?.

We cannot really predict the future. All the scenarios outlined in this book should be understood as possibilities rather than prophecies. When we think about the future, our horizons are usually constrained by present-day ideologies and social systems. Democracy encourages us to believe in a democratic future; capitalism doesn’t allow us to envisage a non-capitalist alternative; and humanism makes it difficult for us to imagine a post-human destiny.

1.  Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing. 2.  Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness. 3.  Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves. These three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you have finished this book: 1.  Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing? 2.  What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness? 3.  What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?.


# A Gentleman in Moscow (Amor Towles)

Vyshinsky: Very well then. How do you spend your time? Rostov: Dining, discussing.

Vyshinsky: Very well then. How do you spend your time? Rostov: Dining, discussing. Reading, reflecting. The usual rigmarole.

Their pinks, greens, and golds shimmered as if it were the sole purpose of a religion to cheer its Divinity.

His waxed moustaches spread like the wings of a gull.

“A king fortifies himself with a castle,” observed the Count, “a gentleman with a desk.”.

From the earliest age, we must learn to say good-bye to friends and family. We see our parents and siblings off at the station; we visit cousins, attend schools, join the regiment; we marry, or travel abroad. It is part of the human experience that we are constantly gripping a good fellow by the shoulders and wishing him well, taking comfort from the notion that we will hear word of him soon enough.

And that if a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them.

When the Count was just seven, he was defeated so soundly by a neighboring boy in a game of draughts that, apparently, a tear was shed, a curse was uttered, and the game pieces were scattered across the floor. This lack of sportsmanship led to a stiff reprimand from the Count’s father and a trip to bed without supper. But as the young Count was gripping his blanket in misery, he was visited by his grandmother. Taking a seat at the foot of the bed, the Countess expressed a measure of sympathy: “There is nothing pleasant to be said about losing,” she began, “and the Obolensky boy is a pill. But, Sasha, my dear, why.

From the earliest age, we must learn to say good-bye to friends and family. We see our parents and siblings off at the station; we visit cousins, attend schools, join the regiment; we marry, or travel abroad. It is part of the human experience that we are constantly gripping a good fellow by the shoulders and wishing him well, taking comfort from the notion that we will hear word of him soon enough. But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest possessions adieu. And if it were to? We wouldn’t welcome the education. For eventually, we come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance. This armoire, we are prone to recall, is the very one in which we hid as a boy; and it was these silver candelabra that lined our table on Christmas Eve; and it was with this handkerchief that she once dried her tears, et cetera, et cetera. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion. But, of course, a thing is just a thing. And so, slipping his sister’s scissors into his pocket, the Count looked once more at what heirlooms remained and then expunged them from his heartache forever.

And at every jest, the shy Marina allowed herself to giggle without placing a hand in front of her lips.

In short, it had been through an era of upheaval that had spared none. Whether one’s leanings were left or right, Red or White, whether one’s personal circumstances had changed for the better or changed for the worse, surely at long last it was time to drink to the health of the nation.

Drifting in the air would be the gentle aroma of freshly baked pretzels, sweet rolls, and loaves of bread so unparalleled they were delivered daily to the Hermitage by train—while arranged in perfect rows behind the glass of the front case would be cakes topped in frostings as varied in color as the tulips of Amsterdam.

Taking his first sip, he noted with satisfaction that young Yuri must have sprinted up the extra three flights of stairs because the coffee was not one degree colder than usual.

Then he sat at his desk and picked up the one volume that he had retained. It must have been a decade since the Count had first promised himself to read this work of universal acclaim that his father had held so dear. And yet, every time he had pointed his finger at his calendar and declared: This is the month in which I shall devote myself to the Essays of Michel de Montaigne! some devilish aspect of life had poked its head in the door. From an unexpected corner had come an expression of romantic interest, which could not in good conscience be ignored. Or his banker had called. Or the circus had come to town.

From an unexpected corner had come an expression of romantic interest, which could not in good conscience be ignored. Or his banker had called. Or the circus had come to town. Life will entice, after all.

It was a pause with which he expressed an element of sympathy for his interlocutor without suggesting for even an instant that there had been a change in their relative stations.

But just as the old Greek was about to step through the door, he paused. “Your Excellency . . . May I ask a personal question?” “By all means.” He gestured almost shyly to the Grand Duke’s desk. “Can we expect more verses from you?” The Count offered an appreciative smile. “I am sorry to say, Konstantin, that my days of poetry are behind me.” “If your days of poetry are behind you, Count Rostov, then it is we who are sorry.”.

As such, one might naturally leap to the conclusion that 1912 had been a perfect year in which to measure the chef’s talents. But in a period of abundance any half-wit with a spoon can please a palate. To truly test a chef’s ingenuity, one must instead look to a period of want. And what provides want better than war?.

“Thank you for the thought, Andrey. Normally, I would leap at the chance. But tonight, I am otherwise committed.”.

Having acknowledged that a man must master his circumstances or otherwise be mastered by them, the Count thought it worth considering how one was most likely to achieve this aim when one had been sentenced to a life of confinement. For Edmond.

Admittedly, the Count had felt a touch of concern when he’d first lifted the book from the desk the day before. For as a single volume, it had the density of a dictionary or Bible—those books that one expects to consult, or possibly peruse, but never read. But it was the Count’s review of the Contents—a list of 107 essays on the likes of Constancy, Moderation, Solitude, and Sleep—that confirmed his initial suspicion that the book had been written with winter nights in mind. Without a doubt, it was a book for when the birds had flown south, the wood was stacked by the fireplace, and the fields were white with snow; that is, for when one had no desire to venture out and one’s friends had no desire to venture in.

Here, Montaigne quoted an array of unimpeachable authorities from the Golden Age who confirmed conclusively that sadness is an emotion best shared.

Long had he believed that a gentleman should turn to a mirror with a sense of distrust. For rather than being tools of self-discovery, mirrors tended to be tools of self-deceit. How many times had he watched as a young beauty turned thirty degrees before her mirror to ensure that she saw herself to the best advantage?.

Long had he believed that a gentleman should turn to a mirror with a sense of distrust. For rather than being tools of self-discovery, mirrors tended to be tools of self-deceit. How many times had he watched as a young beauty turned thirty degrees before her mirror to ensure that she saw herself to the best advantage? (As if henceforth all the world would see her solely from that angle!) How often had he seen a grande dame don a hat that was horribly out of fashion, but that seemed au courant to her because her mirror had been framed in the style of the same bygone era? The Count took pride in wearing a well-tailored jacket; but he took greater pride in knowing that a gentleman’s presence was best announced by his bearing, his remarks, and his manners. Not by the cut of his coat.

And when that celestial chime sounds, perhaps a mirror will suddenly serve its truer purpose—revealing to a man not who he imagines himself to be, but who he has become.

When the Count took his seat with a newspaper in hand—the international symbol of dining alone—the chap didn’t bother to clear the second setting; when the Count closed his menu and placed it beside his plate—the international symbol of readiness to order—the chap needed to be beckoned with a wave of the hand; and when the Count ordered the okroshka and filet of sole, the chap asked if he might like a glass of Sauterne. A perfect suggestion, no doubt, if only the Count had ordered foie gras! “Perhaps a bottle of the Château.

Was the minding of one’s own business no longer a subject taught in schools?.

“Yes,” replied the Count, albeit a little tentatively, “it is. A slouching posture tends to suggest a certain laziness of character, as well as a lack of interest in others. Whereas an upright posture can confirm a sense of self-possession, and a quality of engagement—both of which are befitting of a princess.”.

“The principle here is that a new generation owes a measure of thanks to every member of the previous generation. Our elders planted fields and fought in wars; they advanced the arts and sciences, and generally made sacrifices on our behalf. So by their efforts, however humble, they have earned a measure of our gratitude and respect.”.

“A princess would be raised to say please when she asked for a cake, and thank you when she was offered one.”.

“There is another example.” “Where is another example?” “A princess would be raised to say please when she asked for a cake, and thank you when she was offered one.” Nina looked taken aback; and then dismissive. “I can see that please would be quite appropriate for a princess to say when she has asked for a cake; but I can see no reason why she should have to say thank you when she has been offered one.” “Manners are not like bonbons, Nina. You may not choose the ones that suit you best; and you certainly cannot put the half-bitten ones back in the box. . . .” Nina eyed the Count with an expression of seasoned tolerance, and then presumably for his benefit, spoke a little more slowly.

And I suppose, if having asked for a cake, she is given a cake, then she has good reason to say thank you. But in the second part of your example, the princess in question didn’t ask for the cake; she was offered it. And I see no reason why she should have to say thank you when she is merely obliging someone by accepting what they’ve offered.” To punctuate her point, Nina put a lemon tartlet in her mouth. “I concede that there is some merit to your argument,” said the Count. “But I can only tell you from a life of experience that—” Nina cut him off with a wave of a finger. “But you have just said that you are quite young.” “Indeed, I am.” “Well then, it seems to me that your claim of ‘a life of experience’ may be premature.” Yes, thought the Count, as this tea was making perfectly clear. “I shall work upon my posture,” Nina said quite definitively, brushing the crumbs from her fingers. “And I will be sure to say please and thank you whenever I ask for things. But I have no intention of thanking people for things I never asked for in the first place.”.

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

“A man can never be entirely sure that he is not a fuddy-duddy. That is axiomatic to the term.”.

Oh, come along.” “I’d rather not.” “Don’t be such a fuddy-duddy.” “I am not a fuddy-duddy.” “Can you be so sure?” “A man can never be entirely sure that he is not a fuddy-duddy. That is axiomatic to the term.”.

“It is the business of the times to change, Mr. Halecki. And it is the business of gentlemen to change with them.”.

Hallway to the Piazza, the Count distinctly felt a gust of frozen air, despite being fifty yards from the nearest exit to the street. It brushed past him with all the freshness and clarity of a starlit winter’s night. After pausing and searching about, he realized that the draft was coming . . . from the coatroom.

There must have been such a rush of parties arriving for dinner that the winter air had yet to dissipate from the fabric of their coats.

Most assume this is because the drink is so intrinsically celebratory; but, in fact, it is used at the onset of these dangerous enterprises because it so capably boosts one’s resolve. When the glass was placed on the table, the Count took a swig large enough to tickle his sinuses.

For centuries champagne has been used to launch marriages and ships.

When the glass was placed on the table, the Count took a swig large enough to tickle his sinuses.

“By broadening your horizons,” he ventured, “what I meant is that education will give you a sense of the world’s scope, of its wonders, of its many and varied ways of life.” “Wouldn’t travel achieve that more effectively?” “Travel?” “We are talking about horizons, aren’t we? That horizontal line at the limit of sight? Rather than sitting in orderly rows in a schoolhouse, wouldn’t one be better served by working her way toward an actual horizon, so that she could see what lay beyond it? That’s what Marco Polo did when he traveled to China. And what Columbus did when he traveled to America. And what Peter the Great did when he traveled through Europe incognito!”.

It is the mark of a fine chess player to tip over his own king when he sees that defeat is inevitable, no matter how many moves remain in the game.

“It is a sad but unavoidable fact of life,” he began, “that as we age our social circles grow smaller.

“It is a sad but unavoidable fact of life,” he began, “that as we age our social circles grow smaller. Whether from increased habit or diminished vigor, we suddenly find ourselves in the company of just a few familiar faces. So I view it as an incredible stroke of good fortune at this stage in my life to have found such a fine new friend.”.

Admittedly, it takes a certain amount of discipline to sit in a chair and read a novel, even a seasonal one, when a beautifully wrapped present waits within arm’s reach and the only witness is a one-eyed cat. But this was a discipline the Count had mastered as a child when, in the days leading up to Christmas, he had marched past the closed drawing-room doors with the unflinching stare of a Buckingham Palace guard.

You may accuse a dog of eating without grace or of exhibiting a misplaced enthusiasm for the tossing of sticks, but you may never accuse one of giving up hope.

Suddenly—I shone in all my might, and morning rang its round. Always to shine, to shine everywhere, to the very depths of the last days, to shine— and to hell with everything else! That is my motto—.

Suddenly—I shone in all my might, and morning rang its round. Always to shine, to shine everywhere, to the very depths of the last days, to shine— and to hell with everything else! That is my motto— and the sun’s!.

And as she talked, the Count had to acknowledge once again the virtues of withholding judgment.

After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we’ve just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration—and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.

As a young man, the Count had prided himself on being one step ahead. The timely appearance, the apt expression, the anticipation of a need, to the Count these had been the very hallmarks of the well-bred man. But under the circumstances, he discovered that being a step behind had merits of its own. For one, it was so much more relaxing. To be a step ahead in matters of romance requires constant vigilance. If one hopes to make a successful advance, one must be mindful of every utterance, attend to every gesture, and take note of every look. In other words, to be a step ahead in romance is exhausting. But to be a step behind? To be seduced? Why, that was a matter of leaning back in one’s chair, sipping one’s wine, and responding to a query with the very first thought that has popped into one’s head. And yet, paradoxically, if being a step behind was more relaxing than being a step ahead, it was also more exciting. From his relaxed position, the one-step-behinder imagines that his evening with a new acquaintance will transpire like any other—with a little chit, a little chat, and a friendly goodnight at the door. But halfway through dinner there is an unexpected compliment and an accidental brushing of fingers against one’s hand; there is a tender admission and a self-effacing laugh; then suddenly a kiss.

Why is it that so many ghosts prefer to travel the halls of night? Ask the living and they will tell you that these spirits either have some unquenched desire or an unaddressed grievance that stirs them from their sleep and sends them out into the world in search of solace. But the living are so self-centered.

Why is it that so many ghosts prefer to travel the halls of night? Ask the living and they will tell you that these spirits either have some unquenched desire or an unaddressed grievance that stirs them from their sleep and sends them out into the world in search of solace. But the living are so self-centered. Of course they would judge a spirit’s nocturnal wanderings as the product of earthly memories. When, in fact, if these restless souls wanted to harrow the bustling avenues of noon, there is nothing to stop them from doing so. No. If they wander the halls of night, it is not from a grievance with or envy of the living. Rather, it is because they have no desire to see the living at all. Any more than snakes hope to see gardeners, or foxes the hounds. They wander about at midnight because at that hour they can generally do so without being harried by the sound and fury of earthly emotions. After all those years of striving and struggling, of hoping and praying, of shouldering expectations, stomaching opinions, navigating decorum, and making conversation, what they seek, quite simply, is a little peace and quiet. At least, that is what the Count told himself as he drifted down the hall.

Dreams of invisibility are as old as folklore. By means of some talisman or potion, or with the help of the gods themselves, the corporeal presence of the hero is rendered insubstantial, and for the duration of the spell he may wander among his fellow men unseen. The advantages of having such a power can be rattled off for you by any child of ten. Whether slipping past dragons, eavesdropping on intriguers, and sneaking into treasuries, or plucking a pie from the pantry, knocking the cap off a constable, and lighting the schoolmaster’s coattails on fire, suffice it to say that a thousand tales have been told in acknowledgment of invisibility’s bounty. But the tale that has less often been told is the one in which the spell of invisibility is cast upon the unknowing hero in the form of a curse. Having lived his life in the heat of battle, at the crux of conversation, and in the twentieth row with its privileged view of the ladies in the loges—that is, in the very thick of things—suddenly, he finds himself invisible to friend and foe alike. And the spell that had been cast over the Count by Anna Urbanova in 1923 was of this very sort.

The Count took another look at the sheet in his hands with a heightened sense of respect. After all, an educated man should admire any course of study no matter how arcane, if it be pursued with curiosity and devotion.

Now, when a man has been underestimated by a friend, he has some cause for taking offense—since it is our friends who should overestimate our capacities. They should have an exaggerated opinion of our moral fortitude, our aesthetic sensibilities, and our intellectual scope. Why, they should practically imagine us leaping through a window in the nick of time with the works of Shakespeare in one hand and a pistol in the other! But in this particular instance, the Count had to admit he had little grounds for taking offense. Because, for the life of him, he could not imagine from what dark corner of his adolescent mind this extraordinary fact had materialized.

Late. But then, the measure of fifteen minutes is entirely different for a man in step than for a man with nothing to do. If for the Count the prior twelve months could be characterized politely as uneventful, the same could.

But then, the measure of fifteen minutes is entirely different for a man in step than for a man with nothing to do.

If patience wasn’t so easily tested, then it would hardly be a virtue. . ..

It is a fact of human life that one must eventually choose a philosophy.

Whether through careful consideration spawned by books and spirited debate over coffee at two in the morning, or simply from a natural proclivity, we must all eventually adopt a fundamental framework, some reasonably coherent system of causes and effects that will help us make sense not simply of momentous events, but of all the little actions and interactions that constitute our daily lives—be they deliberate or spontaneous, inevitable or unforeseen.

In keeping with the fashion of the times, most of the Count’s schoolmates had turned their backs on the church; but they had only done so in favor of alternative consolations. Some who preferred the clarity of science adhered to the ideas of Darwin, seeing at every turn the mark of natural selection; while others opted for Nietzsche and his eternal recurrence or Hegel and his dialectic—each system quite sensible, no doubt, when one had finally arrived at the one-thousandth page.

But for the Count, his philosophical leanings had always been essentially meteorological. Specifically, he believed in the inevitable influence of clement and inclement weathers. He believed in the influence of early frosts and lingering summers, of ominous clouds and delicate rains, of fog and sunshine and snowfall. And he believed, most especially, in the reshaping of destinies by the slightest change in the thermometer.

He believed in the influence of early frosts and lingering summers, of ominous clouds and delicate rains, of fog and sunshine and snowfall. And he believed, most especially, in the reshaping of destinies by the slightest change in the thermometer. By way of example, one need only look down from this window. Not three weeks before—with the temperature hovering around 45˚ Fahrenheit—Theatre Square had been empty and gray. But with an increase in the average temperature of just five degrees, the trees had begun to blossom, the sparrows had begun to sing, and couples young and old were lingering on the benches. If such a slight change in temperature was all it took to transform the life of a public square, why should we.

If such a slight change in temperature was all it took to transform the life of a public square, why should we think the course of human history any less susceptible?.

So, the Count kept his wonderings where they belonged.

“Chekhov and Tolstoy.”.

“Yes, yes. I know what you’re going to say: that every nation has its poets in the pantheon. But with Chekhov and Tolstoy, we Russians have set the bronze bookends on the mantelpiece of narrative. Henceforth, writers of fictions from wheresoever they hail, will place themselves on the continuum that begins with the one and ends with the other. For who, I ask you, has exhibited better mastery of the shorter form than Chekhov in his flawless little stories? Precise and uncluttered, they invite us into some corner of a household at some discrete hour in which the entire human condition is suddenly within reach, if heartbreakingly so. While at the other extreme: Can you conceive of a work greater in scope than War and Peace? One that moves so deftly from the parlor to the battlefield and back again? That so fully investigates how the individual is shaped by history, and history by the individual? In the generations to come, I tell you there will be no new authors to supplant these two as the alpha and omega of narrative.”.

But when a man’s country is dismissed so offhandedly, he cannot hide behind his preferences or his appointments—especially when he has drunk a bottle of White and a snifter of brandy.

“No. That’s not quite it. I know a man of erudition.

From primitive tribes to the most advanced societies, someone has occasionally been told by his fellow men to pack his bags, cross the border, and never set foot on his native soil again. But perhaps this was to be expected. After all, exile was the punishment that God meted out to Adam in the very first chapter of the human comedy; and that He meted out to Cain a few pages later. Yes, exile was as old as mankind. But the Russians were the first people to master the notion of sending a man into exile at home.

A life too brief, a heart too kind.”.

But time and tide wait for no man.

History is the business of identifying momentous events from the comfort of a high-back chair. With the benefit of time, the historian looks back and points to a date in the manner of a gray-haired field marshal pointing to a bend in a river on a map: There it was, he says. The turning point. The decisive factor. The fateful day that fundamentally altered all that was to follow.

Where else in all of Europe could one shout a single word to hail any of one’s countrymen be they male or female, young or old, friend or foe?.

Infantry—having learned from experience that victory on the field of battle begins with the shine on a boot.

“The surest way to insult a Walloon is to mistake him for a Frenchman, though they live but a few miles apart and share the same language.”.

“As a host, it was perfectly appropriate for you to take up the serving tools. But a gentleman.

“As a host, it was perfectly appropriate for you to take up the serving tools. But a gentleman would have served his guest before he served himself.”.

“Then allow me to introduce myself: I am Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov—former colonel of the Red Army and an officer of the Party, who as a boy in eastern Georgia dreamed of Moscow, and who as a man of thirty-nine in Moscow dreams of eastern Georgia.”.

“As both a student of history and a man devoted to living in the present, I admit that I do not spend a lot of time imagining how things might otherwise have been. But I do like to think there is a difference between being resigned to a situation and reconciled to it.” Glebnikov.

“As both a student of history and a man devoted to living in the present, I admit that I do not spend a lot of time imagining how things might otherwise have been. But I do like to think there is a difference between being resigned to a situation and reconciled to it.”.

Glebnikov let his sentence trail off, not to imply the paucity of what he could do for the Count, but rather to suggest the abundance.

“Osip, my friend, it is a fundamental rule of academic study that whether a student has read every word of a work matters less than whether he has established a reasonable familiarity with its essential material.”.

Perhaps it is inescapable that when our lives are in flux, despite the comfort of our beds, we are bound to keep ourselves awake grappling with anxieties—no matter how great or small, how real or imagined.

“I gather you are an early riser, Alexander Ilyich,” he said after a moment of silence. “Men of purpose usually are.” The corner of the Bishop’s mouth rose ever so slightly. “Yes, of course. Men of purpose.”.

Osip paused, taking a moment to refill their glasses with wine. “But where do we stand now? How far have we come? By marrying American tempo with Soviet aims, we are on the verge of universal literacy. Russia’s long-suffering women, our second serfdom, have been elevated to the status of equals. We have built whole new cities and our industrial production outpaces that of most of Europe.” “But at what cost?” Osip slapped the table. “At the greatest cost! But do you think the achievements of the Americans—envied the world over—came without a cost? Just ask their African brothers. And do you think the engineers who designed their illustrious skyscrapers or built their highways hesitated for one moment to level the lovely little neighborhoods that stood in their way? I guarantee you, Alexander, they laid the dynamite and pushed the plungers themselves. As I’ve said to you before, we and the Americans will lead the rest of this century because we are the only nations who have learned to brush the past aside instead of bowing before it. But where they have done so in service of their beloved individualism, we are attempting to do so in service of the common good.”.

“Take that fellow Socrates. Two thousand years ago, he wandered around the marketplace sharing his thoughts with whomever he bumped into; and he wouldn’t even take the time to write them down. Then, in something of a fix, he punched his own ticket; pulled his own plug; collapsed his own umbrella. Adios. Adieu. Finis. “Time marched on, as it will. The Romans took over. Then the barbarians. And then we threw the whole Middle Ages at him. Hundreds of years of plagues and poisonings and the burning of books. And somehow, after all of that, the grand things this fellow happened to say in the marketplace are still with us.

We don’t know how a man or his achievements will be perceived three generations from now, any more than we know what his great-great-grandchildren will be having for breakfast on a Tuesday in March. Because when Fate hands something down to posterity, it does so behind its back.” They were both silent for a moment. Then the captain emptied his glass and pointed a finger at the Count’s brandy. “Tell me, though, is that thing pulling its weight?”.

“Alexander,” he said with a smile, “you have been at my service for over fifteen years.

“Osip, I don’t know how to repay you.” “Alexander,” he said with a smile, “you have been at my service for over fifteen years. It is a pleasure for once to be at yours.” Then he was gone.

Had he felt pride in Sofia before? Of course he had. On a daily basis. He was proud of her success in school, of her beauty, of her composure, of the fondness with which she was regarded by all who worked in the hotel. And that is how he could be certain that what he was experiencing at that moment could not be referred to as pride. For there is something knowing in the state of pride. Look, it says, didn’t I tell you how special she is? How bright? How lovely? Well, now you can see it for yourself. But in listening to Sofia play Chopin, the Count had left the realm of knowing and entered the realm of astonishment.

He waved the cigarette at the ceiling.

But hadn’t the Count once waxed poetic over how slowly the stars advanced? Hadn’t he rhapsodized over how the constellations seemed to halt in their course when on a warm summer’s night one lay on one’s back and listened for footsteps in the grass—as if nature itself were conspiring to lengthen the last few hours before daybreak, so that they could be savored to the utmost?.

Or had they stopped somewhere on the way home . . . ? Was it possible that in passing a café they could not resist the impulse to slip inside and share a pastry while he waited and waited and waited? Could they have been so heartless? (If so, they dare not attempt to hide the fact, for he could tell if a pastry had been eaten from a distance of fifty feet!).

Preparing for a potential celebration is a tricky business. If Fortune smiles, then one must be ready to hit the ceiling with the cork. But if Fortune shrugs, then one must be prepared to act as if this were just another night, one of no particular consequence—and then later sink the unopened bottle to the bottom of the sea.

After all, the clock was over fifty years old, and even the finest timepieces must be subject to the ravages of Time.

It is a well-known fact that of all the species on earth Homo sapiens is among the most adaptable. Settle a tribe of them in a desert and they will wrap themselves in cotton, sleep in tents, and travel on the backs of camels; settle them in the Arctic and they will wrap themselves in sealskin, sleep in igloos, and travel by dog-drawn sled. And if you settle them in a Soviet climate? They will learn to make friendly conversation with strangers while waiting in line; they will learn to neatly stack their clothing in their half of the bureau drawer; and they will learn to draw imaginary buildings in their sketchbooks. That is, they will adapt. But certainly one aspect of adaptation for those Russians who had seen Paris before the Revolution was the acceptance that they would never, ever see Paris again. . ..

Alexander Rostov was neither scientist nor sage; but at the age of sixty-four he was wise enough to know that life does not proceed by leaps and bounds. It unfolds. At any given moment, it is the manifestation of a thousand transitions. Our faculties wax and wane, our experiences accumulate, and our opinions evolve—if not glacially, then at least gradually. Such that the events of an average day are as likely to transform who we are as a pinch of pepper is to transform a stew.

The first was that if one did not master one’s circumstances, one was bound to be mastered by them; and the second was Montaigne’s maxim that the surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness. But when it came to expressing admissions of heartache, the Count had not held back. He told her exactly how sad he would be in her absence, and yet, how joyful he would feel at the slightest thought of her grand adventure.

Chosen to see to all of that the night before, after their discussion.

Showing a sense of personal restraint that was almost out of character, the Count had restricted himself to two succinct pieces of parental advice. The first was that if one did not master one’s circumstances, one was bound to be mastered by them; and the second was Montaigne’s maxim that the surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness. But when it came to expressing admissions of heartache, the Count had not held back. He told her exactly how sad he would be in her absence, and yet, how joyful he would feel at the slightest thought of her grand adventure.

Why was the Count so careful to ensure that all of this was covered on the night before Sofia’s journey? Because well he knew that when one is traveling abroad for the first time, one does not wish to look back on laborsome instructions, weighty advice, or tearful sentiments. Like the memory of the simple soup, when one is homesick what one will find most comforting to recall are those lighthearted little stories that have been told a thousand times before. That said, when their plates were finally empty, the Count attempted to broach a new subject that had clearly weighed on his mind. “I was thinking . . . ,” he began rather haltingly. “Or rather, it occurred to me, that you might like . . . Or at some point, perhaps . . .” Amused to see her father so uncharacteristically flummoxed, Sofia laughed. “What is it, Papa? What might I like?” Reaching into his jacket, the Count sheepishly removed the photograph that Mishka had tucked into the pages of his project. “I know how you treasure the photograph of your parents, so I thought . . . you might like a picture of me, as well.” Blushing for the first time in over forty years, he handed her the picture, adding: “It’s the only one I have.” Genuinely moved, Sofia accepted the photograph with every intention of expressing her deepest gratitude; but getting a look at the picture, she clapped a hand over her mouth and began to laugh. “Your moustaches!” she blurted. “I know, I know,” he said. “Although, believe it or not, at one time, they were the envy of the Jockey Club. . . .”.

“Looking back, it seems to me that there are people who play an essential role at every turn. And I don’t just mean the Napoleons who influence the course of history; I mean men and women who routinely appear at critical junctures in the progress of art, or commerce, or the evolution of ideas—as if Life itself has summoned them once again to help fulfill its purpose. Well, since the day I was born, Sofia, there was only one time when Life needed me to be in a particular place at a particular time, and that was when your mother brought you to the lobby of the Metropol. And I would not accept the Tsarship of all the Russias in exchange for being in this hotel at that hour.”.

Do you still dine with all of the friends with whom you dined twenty years ago? Suffice it to say that the two shared a fondness for each other and despite their best intentions, life intervened.

When a single telephone rings, our immediate instinct is to pick up the receiver and say hello. But when thirty ring at once, our instinct is to take two steps back and stare.

# Ram - Scion of Ikshvaku: 1 (Ram Chandra) (Tripathi, Amish)

Khalil Gibran said that parents are like a bow,
And children like arrows.
The more the bow bends and stretches, the farther the arrow flies.
I fly, not because I am special, but because they stretched for me.

Patriots are often called traitors by the very people they choose to serve, till history passes the final judgement.

Passionate children have strong emotions that insist on finding expression. They laugh loudly. They cry even more loudly.

A king need be judged solely on the basis of what he achieves for his people. His personal life is of no consequence. His public life, though, has one singular purpose: to provide for his people and improve their lives.’.

‘Expecting people to follow rules just because they should is being too hopeful. Rules must be designed to dovetail with selfish interest because people are primarily driven by it. They need to be shepherded into good behaviour through this proclivity.’.

We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves.

Want a woman, not a girl.’ ‘Aha! I always knew there was a naughty devil behind that serious exterior!’.

‘I want a woman, not a girl.’ ‘Aha! I always knew there was a naughty devil behind that serious exterior!’.

‘What are you looking for?’ Ram looked into the distance at the forest line. ‘I want a woman, not a girl.’ ‘Aha! I always knew there was a naughty devil behind that serious exterior!’ Ram rolled his eyes and punched Bharat playfully on his abdomen. ‘That’s not what I meant. You know that.’.

‘A relationship is not just for fun, it is also about trust and the knowledge that you can depend on your partner. Relationships based on passion and excitement do not last.’.

‘I guess what I’m trying to say is that I want a woman who is better than I am; a woman who will compel me to bow my head in admiration.’.

But if the government interferes to such an extent that the weak thrive and the strong are oppressed, society itself will collapse over time. A society should not forget that it thrives on the ideas and performance of the talented among its citizens.

Giving a sharp sword to a child is not an act of generosity, but irresponsibility.

Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’.

‘If He is my God, if He picks my side over someone else’s, He is not the One God. The only true One God is the one who picks no sides, who belongs to everything, who doesn’t demand loyalty or fear; in fact, who doesn’t demand anything at all. Because the Ekam just exists; and His existence allows for the existence of all else.’.

The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material.

There is something positive hidden in every negative, and something negative hidden in every positive. Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.

‘Birth is completely unimportant. It is just a means of entry into this world of action, into this karmabhoomi. Karma is all that matters. And your karma is divine.’.

“A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’.

‘Yes. Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.’.

I’m talking about immortality for my name. I know that I have wasted my life and my potential. People compare me to my great ancestors and find me wanting. But Ram… He will go down in history as one of the greatest ever. And he will redeem my name. I will be remembered as Ram’s father for all time to come. Ram’s greatness will rub off on me. He has already defeated Raavan!’.

‘One of these days, I’ll stop speaking to you for the fear of being understood.’.

‘I’m not drinking it without you. What’s the point of my long life, if I don’t have you to share it with?’.

‘Well, they say the jungles are dangerous and it is the cities where you find comfort and security. It has been exactly the other way round for me. I have never been more relaxed and happy in my life than in the Dandakaranya.’.

“When the axe entered the forest, the trees said to each other: do not worry, the handle in that axe is one of us”.’.

‘I could agree with you, Prince of Lanka,’ said Lakshman, smiling, ‘but then we would both be wrong.’.


# The Origin of Species (Charles Darwin)

He explained how psychological characters like instincts and emotions could and would be evolved by natural means, though it was not until 1872 that, with his remarkable book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, he initiated the comparative study of animal behaviour, or ethology as it is now called. By his constant emphasis on the complicated web of interrelations between different organisms in a given habitat or region he laid the foundations for the new and flourishing branch of science now known as ecology.

# The Fountainhead (Ayn;Peikoff Rand;Ayn;Peikoff Rand)

“If a writer wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.”.

In a play I wrote in my early thirties, Ideal, the heroine, a screen star, speaks for me when she says: “I want to see, real, living, and in the hours of my own days, that glory I create as an illusion. I want it real. I want to know that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too. Or else what is the use of seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? A spirit, too, needs fuel. It can run dry.” Frank was the fuel. He gave me, in the hours of my own days, the reality of that sense of life, which created The Fountainhead--and he helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion. The essence of the bond between us is the fact that neither of us has ever wanted or been tempted to settle for anything less than the world presented in The Fountainhead. We never will.

“Why don't you tell me what you think of me?” Roark answers: “But I don't think of you.”.

Frank talked to me for hours, that night. He convinced me of why one cannot give up the world to those one despises.

I have been asked whether I have changed in these past twenty-five years. No, I am the same--only more so. Have my ideas changed? No, my fundamental convictions, my view of life and of man, have never changed, from as far back as I can remember, but my knowledge of their applications has grown, in scope and in precision. What is my present evaluation of The Fountainhead? I am as proud of it as I was on the day when I finished writing it.

'Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself?'.

The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see man's highest potential and strive to actualize it. The man-haters are those who regard man as a helpless, depraved, contemptible creature--and struggle never to let him discover otherwise.

His hair was neither blond nor red, but the exact color of ripe orange rind.

He laughed at the thing which had happened to him that morning and at the things which now lay ahead.

He knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were questions to be faced and a plan of action to be prepared. He knew that he should think about it. He knew also that he would not think, because everything was clear to him already, because the plan had been set long ago, and because he wanted to laugh.

“I'm not one to boast. Some mothers are lucky and others just aren't. We're all in our rightful place. You just watch Petey from now on. I'm not one to want my boy to kill himself with work and I'll thank the Lord for any small success that comes his way. But if that boy isn't the greatest architect of this U.S.A., his mother will want to know the reason why!”.

The buildings were not Classical, they were not Gothic, they were not Renaissance. They were only Howard Roark.

They were sketches of buildings such as had never stood on the face of the earth. They were as the first houses built by the first man born, who had never heard of others building before him. There was nothing to be said of them, except that each structure was inevitably what it had to be. It was not as if the draftsman had sat over them, pondering laboriously, piecing together doors, windows and columns, as his whim dictated and as the books prescribed. It was as if the buildings had sprung from the earth and from some living force, complete, unalterably right. The hand that had made the sharp pencil lines still had much to learn. But not a line seemed superfluous, not a needed plane was missing. The structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and realized what work, what complexity of method, what tension of thought had achieved the simplicity. No laws had dictated a single detail. The buildings were not Classical, they were not Gothic, they were not Renaissance. They were only Howard Roark.

You intended to become an architect, not a civil engineer.”.

“I feel nothing of the kind,” said Roark quietly. “I owe you an apology. I don't usually let things happen to me. I made a mistake this time. I shouldn't have waited for you to throw me out. I should have left long ago.”.

“Do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously of building that way, when and if you are an architect?” “Yes.” “My dear fellow, who will let you?” “That's not the point. The point is, who will stop me?”.

You must learn to understand--and it has been proved by all authorities--that everything beautiful in architecture has been done already. There is a treasure mine in every style of the past. We can only choose from the great masters. Who are we to improve upon them? We can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat.”.

“The famous flutings on the famous columns--what are they there for? To hide the joints in wood--when columns were made of wood, only these aren't, they're marble. The triglyphs, what are they? Wood. Wooden beams, the way they had to be laid when people began to build wooden shacks. Your Greeks took marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it, because others had done it that way. Then your masters of the Renaissance came along and made copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Now here we are, making copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood. Why?”.

“Rules?” said Roark. “Here are my rules: what can be done with one substance must never be done with another. No two materials are alike. No two sites on earth are alike. No two buildings have the same purpose. The purpose, the site, the material determine the shape. Nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unless it's made by one central idea, and the idea sets every detail. A building is alive, like a man. Its integrity is to follow its own truth, its one single theme, and to serve its own single purpose. A man doesn't borrow pieces of his body. A building doesn't borrow hunks of its soul. Its maker gives it the soul and every wall, window and stairway to express it.”.

“Expression--of what? The Parthenon did not serve the same purpose as its wooden ancestor. An airline terminal does not serve the same purpose as the Parthenon. Every form has its own meaning. Every man creates his meaning and form and goal. Why is it so important--what others have done? Why does it become sacred by the mere fact of not being your own? Why is anyone and everyone right--so long as it's not yourself? Why does the number of those others take the place of truth? Why is truth made a mere matter of arithmetic--and only of addition at that? Why is everything twisted out of all sense to fit everything else? There must be some reason. I don't know. I've never known it. I'd like to understand.”.

I don't intend to build in order to have clients. I intend to have clients in order to build.”.

Because I don't intend to build in order to serve or help anyone. I don't intend to build in order to have clients. I intend to have clients in order to build.”.

You are a man not to be encouraged. You are dangerous.”.

He knew the source of his actions; he could not discover theirs.

He had never learned the process of thinking about other people.

He thought only of how lovely the stone looked in the fragile light and of what he could have done with that stone.

He thought of a broad sheet of paper, and he saw, rising on the paper, bare walls of gray limestone with long bands of glass, admitting the glow of the sky into the classrooms. In the comer of the sheet stood a sharp, angular signature--HOWARD ROARK.

“...ARCHITECTURE, my friends, is a great Art based on two cosmic principles: Beauty and Utility. In a broader sense, these are but part of the three eternal entities: Truth, Love and Beauty. Truth--to the traditions of our Art, Love--for our fellow men whom we are to serve, Beauty--ah, Beauty is a compelling goddess to all artists, be it in the shape of a lovely woman or a building....Hm....Yes....In conclusion, I should like to say to you, who are about to embark upon your careers in architecture, that you are now the custodians of a sacred heritage....Hm....Yes....So, go forth into the world, armed with the three eternal entities--armed with courage and vision, loyal to the standards this great school has represented for many years. May you all serve faithfully, neither as slaves to the past nor as those parvenus who preach originality for its own sake, which attitude is only ignorant vanity. May you all have many rich, active years before you and leave, as you depart from this world, your mark on the sands of time!”.

“If you want my advice, Peter,” he said at last, “you've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?”.

It was not necessary to design buildings any longer, only to photograph them; the architect with the best library was the best architect Imitators copied imitations.

Henry Cameron had nothing to offer against this; nothing but a faith he held merely because it was his own. He had nobody to quote and nothing of importance to say. He said only that the form of a building must follow its function; that the structure of a building is the key to its beauty; that new methods of construction demand new forms; that he wished to build as he wished and for that reason only. But people could not listen to him when they were discussing Vitruvius, Michelangelo and Sir Christopher Wren.

He had never learned to give explanations, only orders.

He had never learned to give explanations, only orders. He had never been liked. He had been feared. No one feared him any longer.

He was allowed to live. He lived to loathe the streets of the city he had dreamed of rebuilding. He lived to sit at the desk in his empty office, motionless, idle, waiting. He lived to read in a well-meaning newspaper account a reference to “the late Henry Cameron.” He lived to begin drinking, quietly, steadily, terribly, for days and nights at a time; and to hear those who had driven him to it say, when his name was mentioned for a commission: “Cameron? I should say not. He drinks like a fish. That's why he never gets any work.”.

“When did you decide to become an architect?” “When I was ten years old.” “Men don't know what they want so early in life, if ever. You're lying.” “Am I?” “Don't stare at me like that! Can't you look at something else? Why did you decide to be an architect?” “I didn't know it then. But it's because I've never believed in God.” “Come on, talk sense.” “Because I love this earth. That's all I love. I don't like the shape of things on this earth. I want to change them.”.

“For whom?” “For myself.” “How old are you?” “Twenty-two.” “When did you hear all that?” “I didn't.” “Men don't talk like that at twenty-two. You're abnormal.” “Probably.” “I didn't mean it as a compliment.” “I didn't either.” “Got any family?”.

I don't need any draftsmen! There's nothing here to draft! I don't have enough work to keep myself and my men out of the Bowery Mission! I don't want any fool visionaries starving around here! I don't want the responsibility. I didn't ask for it. I never thought I'd see it again. I'm through with it. I was through with that many years ago. I'm perfectly happy with the drooling dolts I've got here, who never had anything and never will have and it makes no difference what becomes of them. That's all I want Why did you have to come here? You're setting out to ruin yourself, you know that, don't you? And I'll help you to do it. I don't want to see you. I don't like you. I don't like your face. You look like an insufferable egotist. You're impertinent. You're too sure of yourself. Twenty years ago I'd have punched your face with the greatest of pleasure. You're coming to work here tomorrow at nine o'clock sharp.”.

That he had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite; that he owned a quarry of gray granite in Connecticut, which did a thriving business;.

“I don't want to meet him. Not through you....You see, Katie, you don't know me. I'm the kind that uses people. I don't want to use you. Ever. Don't let me. Not you.”.

“It's no use wasting what you've got on an ideal that you'll never reach, that they'll never let you reach. It's no use, taking that marvelous thing you have and making a torture rack for yourself out of it. Sell it, Roark. Sell it now. It won't be the same, but you've got enough in you. You've got what they'll pay you for, and pay plenty, if you use it their way. Accept them, Roark. Compromise. Compromise now, because you'll have to later, anyway, only then you'll have gone through things you'll wish you hadn't. You don't know. I do. Save yourself from that. Leave me. Go to someone else.”.

“You presumptuous bastard! How good do you think I said you were? Did I tell you to compare yourself to...” He stopped because he saw that Roark was smiling.

“That's why I'm saying it! Because that's not what I did!...Look, Roark, there's one thing about you, the thing I'm afraid of. It's not just the kind of work you do; I wouldn't care, if you were an exhibitionist who's being different as a stunt, as a lark, just to attract attention to himself. It's a smart racket, to oppose the crowd and amuse it and collect admission to the side show. If you did that, I wouldn't worry. But it's not that. You love your work. God help you, you love it! And that's the curse. That's the brand on your forehead for all of them to see. You love it, and they know it, and they know they have you. Do you ever look at the people in the street? Aren't you afraid of them? I am. They move past you and they wear hats and they carry bundles. But that's not the substance of them. The substance of them is hatred for any man who loves his work. That's the only kind they fear. I don't know why. You're opening yourself up, Roark, for each and every one of them.”.

“Well, sit down. Listen. I understand. And it's very nice of you. But you don't know. I thought a few days here would be enough to take the hero worship out of you. I see it wasn't. Here you are, saying to yourself how grand old Cameron is, a noble fighter, a martyr to a lost cause, and you'd just love to die on the barricades with me and to eat in dime lunch-wagons with me for the rest of your life. I know, it looks pure and beautiful to you now, at your great old age of twenty-two. But do you know what it means? Thirty years of a lost cause, that sounds beautiful, doesn't it? But do you know how many days there are in thirty years? Do you know what happens in those days? Roark! Do you know what happens?”.

“No! I don't want to speak of that! But I'm going to. I want you to hear. I want you to know what's in store for you. There will be days when you'll look at your hands and you'll want to take something and smash every bone in them, because they'll be taunting you with what they could do, if you found a chance for them to do it, and you can't find that chance, and you can't bear your living body because it has failed those hands somewhere. There will be days when a bus driver will snap at you as you enter a bus, and he'll be only asking for a dime, but that won't be what you'll hear; you'll hear that you're nothing, that he's laughing at you, that it's written on your forehead, that thing they hate you for. There will be days when you'll stand in the corner of a hall and listen to a creature on a platform talking about buildings, about that work which you love, and the things he'll say will make you wait for somebody to rise and crack him open between two thumbnails; and then you'll hear the people applauding him, and you'll want to scream, because you won't know whether they're real or you are, whether you're in a room full of gored skulls, or whether someone has just emptied your own head, and you'll say nothing, because the sounds you could make--they're not a language in that room any longer; but if you'd want to speak, you won't anyway, because you'll be brushed aside, you who have nothing to tell them about buildings! Is that what you want?”.

“Not enough?” asked Cameron. “All right. Then, one day, you'll see on a piece of paper before you a building that will make you want to kneel; you won't believe that you've done it, but you will have done it; then you'll think that the earth is beautiful and the air smells of spring and you love your fellow men, because there is no evil in the world. And you'll set out from your house with this drawing, to have it erected, because you won't have any doubt that it will be erected by the first man to see it. But you won't get very far from your house. Because you'll be stopped at the door by the man who's come to turn off the gas. You hadn't had much food, because you saved money to finish your drawing, but still you had to cook something and you hadn't paid for it....All right, that's nothing, you can laugh at that. But finally you'll get into a man's office with your drawing, and you'll curse yourself for taking so much space of his air with your body, and you'll try to squeeze yourself out of his sight, so that he won't see you, but only hear your voice begging him, pleading, your voice licking his knees; you'll loathe yourself for it, but you won't care, if only he'd let you put up that building, you won't care, you'll want to rip your insides open to show him, because if he saw what's there he'd have to let you put it up. But he'll say that he's very sorry, only the commission has just been given to Guy Francon. And you'll go home, and do you know what you'll do there? You'll cry. You'll cry like a woman, like a drunkard, like an animal. That's your future, Howard Roark. Now, do you want it?”.

He saw her after that every month or two; he was happy when he saw her, but he never spoke to her of his career.

Keating felt naked. Davis, Stengel, Francon meant nothing here. People were his protection against people. Roark had no sense of people. Others gave Keating a feeling of his own value. Roark gave him nothing. He thought that he should seize his drawings and run. The danger was not Roark. The danger was that.

The water had been turned off by a society to whom Cameron had never paid his bill.

On the day of his departure Cameron handed to Roark a letter he had written in the night, written painfully, an old drawing board on his knees, a pillow propping his back. The letter was addressed to a prominent architect; it was Roark's introduction to a job. Roark read it and, looking at Cameron, not at his own hands, tore the letter across, folded the pieces and tore it again. “No,” said Roark. “You're not going to ask them for anything. Don't worry about me.”.

“Architecture is not a business, not a career, but a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the earth.”.

He had learned that it was so simple. His clients would accept anything, so long as he gave them an imposing facade, a majestic entrance and a regal drawing room, with which to astound their guests. It worked out to everyone's satisfaction: Keating did not care so long as his clients were impressed, the clients did not care so long as their guests were impressed, and the guests did not care anyway.

“Oh, I don't think he approves of marriage. Not that he preaches anything immoral, but he's always told me marriage is old-fashioned, an economic device to perpetuate the institution of private property, or something like that or anyway that he doesn't like it.”.

“Do you always have to have a purpose? Do you always have to be so damn serious? Can't you ever do things without reason, just like everybody else? You're so serious, so old. Everything's important with you, everything's great, significant in some way, every minute, even when you keep still. Can't you ever be comfortable--and unimportant?”.

“The un-normal. The strain. When I'm with you--it's always like a choice. Between you--and the rest of the world. I don't want that kind of a choice. I don't want to be an outsider. I want to belong. There's so much in the world that's simple and pleasant. It's.

“The un-normal. The strain. When I'm with you--it's always like a choice. Between you--and the rest of the world. I don't want that kind of a choice. I don't want to be an outsider. I want to belong. There's so much in the world that's simple and pleasant. It's not all fighting and renunciation. It is--with you.”.

“Just to give me something. I know you can't like me. You can't like anybody. So it would be kinder to acknowledge people's existence by hating them.”.

He had no friends in the drafting room. He was there like a piece of furniture, as useful, as impersonal and as silent. Only the chief of the engineering department, to which Roark was assigned, had said to Keating after the first two weeks: “You've got more sense than I gave you credit for, Keating. Thanks.”.

Once in a while, Keating stopped by Roark's table to say softly: “Will you drop in at my office when you're through tonight, Howard? Nothing important.” When Roark came, Keating began by saying: “Well, how do you like it here, Howard? If there's anything you want, just say so and I'll...” Roark interrupted to ask: “Where is it, this time?” Keating produced sketches from a drawer and said: “I know it's perfectly right, just as it is, but what do you think of it, generally speaking?” Roark looked at the sketches, and even though he wanted to throw them at Keating's face and resign, one thought stopped him: the thought that it was a building and that he had to save it, as others could not pass a drowning man without leaping in to the rescue.

They sat together at a table in the corner of a basement speakeasy, and they drank beer, and Mike related his favorite tale of how he had fallen five stories when a scaffolding gave way under him, how he had broken three ribs but lived to tell it, and Roark spoke of his days in the building trades. Mike did have a real name, which was Sean Xavier Donnigan, but everyone had forgotten it long ago; he owned a set of tools and an ancient Ford, and existed for the sole purpose of traveling around the country from one big construction job to another. People meant very little to Mike, but their performance a great deal. He worshipped expertness of any kind. He loved his work passionately and had no tolerance for anything save for other single-track devotions. He was a master in his own field and he felt no sympathy except for mastery. His view of the world was simple: there were the able and there were the incompetent; he was not concerned with the latter. He loved buildings. He despised, however, all architects.

He despised, however, all architects. “There was one, Red,” he said earnestly, over his fifth beer, “one only and you'd be too young to know about him, but that was the only man that knew building. I worked for him when I was your age.” “Who was that?” “Henry Cameron was his name. He's dead, I guess, these many years.” Roark looked at him for a long time, then said: “He's not dead, Mike,” and added: “I've worked for him.” “You did?” “For almost three years.” They looked at each other silently, and that was the final seal on their friendship.

Said Roark, closing his eyes. “If you weren't a protégé.

It was not malice. It was not a judgment passed upon his merit. They did not think he was worthless. They simply did not care to find out whether he was good.

In September, he read an article entitled “Make Way For Tomorrow” by Gordon L. Prescott, A.G.A. in the Architectural Tribune. The article stated that the tragedy of the profession was the hardships placed in the way of its talented beginners; that great gifts had been lost in the struggle, unnoticed; that architecture was perishing from a lack of new blood and new thought, a lack of originality, vision and courage; that the author of the article made it his aim to search for promising beginners, to encourage them, develop them and give them the chance they deserved. Roark had never heard of Gordon L. Prescott, but there was a tone of honest conviction in the article. He allowed himself to start for Prescott's office with the first hint of hope.

The strike of the building-trades unions infuriated Guy Francon. The strike had started against the contractors who were erecting the Noyes-Belmont Hotel, and had spread to all the new structures of the city. It had been mentioned in the press that the architects of the Noyes-Belmont were the firm of Francon & Heyer.

“Well, you know of course that I won't believe that. Why do you write if you have nothing you want to say?” “To have something to do. Something more disgusting than many other things I could do. And more amusing.”.

He had found a small firm that needed the work and undertook it, charging more than the job warranted--on the ground of the chance they were taking with a queer experiment. The construction went on, and the foremen obeyed sullenly, in disapproving silence, as if they were waiting for their predictions to come true and would be glad when the house collapsed about their heads. Roark had bought an old Ford and drove down to the job more often than was necessary. It was difficult to sit at a desk in his office, to stand at a table, forcing himself to stay away from the construction site. At the site there were moments when he wished to forget his office and his drawing board, to seize the men's tools and go to work on the actual erection of the house, as he had worked in his childhood, to build that house with his own hands.

In the deeper reality of Roark's existence there was no consciousness of Heller, no need for Heller, no appeal, no demand. Heller felt a line drawn, which he could not touch; beyond that line, Roark asked nothing of him and granted him nothing. But when Roark looked at him with approval, when Roark smiled, when Roark praised one of his articles, Heller felt the strangely clean joy of a sanction that was neither a bribe nor alms.

“What is it that I like so much about the house you're building for me, Howard?” “A house can have integrity, just like a person,” said Roark, “and just as seldom.”.

“What is it that I like so much about the house you're building for me, Howard?” “A house can have integrity, just like a person,” said Roark, “and just as seldom.” “In what way?” “Well, look at it. Every piece of it is there because the house needs it--and for no other reason. You see it from here as it is inside. The rooms in which you'll live made the shape. The relation of masses was determined by the distribution of space within. The ornament was determined by the method of construction, an emphasis of the principle that makes it stand. You can see each stress, each support that meets it. Your own eyes go through a structural process when you look at the house, you can follow each step, you see it rise, you know what made it and why it stands. But you've seen buildings with columns that support nothing, with purposeless cornices, with pilasters, moldings, false arches, false windows. You've seen buildings that look as if they contained a single large hall, they have solid columns and single, solid windows six floors high. But you enter and find six stories inside. Or buildings that contain a single hall, but with a facade cut up into floor lines, band courses, tiers of windows. Do you understand the difference? Your house is made by its own needs. Those others are made by the need to impress. The determining motive of your house is in the house. The determining motive of the others is in the audience.”.

“We'd all be a heap sight better off if we'd forget the highfalutin notions of our fancy civilization and mind more what the savages knew long before us: to honor our mother.”.

His hand raised with a cigarette held between two fingers that did not tremble.

“You know, it's such a peculiar thing--our idea of mankind in general. We all have a sort of vague, glowing picture when we say that, something solemn, big and important. But actually all we know of it is the people we meet in our lifetime. Look at them. Do you know any you'd feel big and solemn about? There's nothing but housewives haggling at pushcarts, drooling brats who write dirty words on the sidewalks, and drunken debutantes. Or their spiritual equivalent. As a matter of fact, one can feel some respect for people when they suffer. They have a certain dignity. But have you ever looked at them when they're enjoying themselves? That's when you see the truth. Look at those who spend the money they've slaved for--at amusement parks and side shows. Look at those who're rich and have the whole world open to them. Observe what they pick out for enjoyment. Watch them in the smarter speak-easies. That's your mankind in general. I don't want to touch it.”.

“So much the worse. Is it an inspiring sight to see a man commit a heroic gesture, and then learn that he goes to vaudeville shows for relaxation? Or see a man who's painted a magnificent canvas--and learn that he spends his time sleeping with every slut he meets?”.

“You call that freedom?” “To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.”.

“What if you found something you wanted?” “I won't find it. I won't choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I'd have to share it with all the rest of you--and I wouldn't. You know, I never open again any great book I've read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can't be shared. Not with people like that.”.

There's always a mob around her, but never a friend.

“Maybe so, folks, maybe so,” and proceeded to have Roark build his station.

Jimmy uttered no word of explanation or self-defense; he said politely: “Maybe so, folks, maybe so,” and proceeded to have Roark build his station.

“I know you didn't. That's the point. You're a self-centered monster, Howard. The more monstrous because you're utterly innocent about it.”.

“I know you didn't. That's the point. You're a self-centered monster, Howard. The more monstrous because you're utterly innocent about it.” “That's true.” “You should show a little concern when you admit that.” “Why?” “You know, there's a thing that stumps me. You're the coldest man I know. And I can't understand why--knowing that you're actually a fiend in your quiet sort of way--why I always feel, when I see you, that you're the most life-giving person I've ever met.” “What do you mean?” “I don't know. Just that.”.

Will you tell me why, when it comes to a building, you don't want it to look as if it had any sense or purpose, you want to choke it with trimmings, you want to sacrifice its purpose to its envelope--not knowing even why you want that kind of an envelope?.

“Don't you know that most people take most things because that's what's given them, and they have no opinion whatever? Do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment?”.

“Because I can't. I couldn't if I tried. I dry up. I go blank. I can't give them what they want. But I can straighten someone else's damn mess when I see it:”.

I really came here to thank you, Howard. I haven't forgotten that you had a share in that building, you did give me some advice on it. I'd be the first one to give you part of the credit.” “That's not necessary.” “Oh, it's not that I'd mind, but I'm sure you wouldn't want me to say anything about it. And I'm sure you don't want to say anything yourself, because you know how it is, people are so funny, they misinterpret everything in such a stupid way....But since I'm getting part of the award money, I thought it's only fair to let you have some of it. I'm glad that it comes at a time when you need it so badly.” He produced his billfold, pulled from it a check he had made out in advance and put it down on the desk. It read: “Pay to the order of Howard Roark--the sum of five hundred dollars.” “Thank you, Peter,” said Roark, taking the check. Then he turned it over, took his fountain pen, wrote on the back: “Pay to the order of Peter Keating,” signed and handed the check to Keating. “And here's my bribe to you, Peter,” he said. “For the same purpose. To keep your mouth shut.” Keating stared at him blankly. “That's all I can offer you now,” said Roark. “You can't extort anything from me at present, but later, when I'll have money, I'd like to ask you please not to blackmail me. I'm telling you frankly that you could. Because I don't want anyone to know that I had anything to do with that building.”.

Keating felt an icy sense of relief. He felt heavy and very tired, but drearily sure of himself. He had acquired the knowledge of one thing: he hated Roark. It was not necessary to doubt and wonder and squirm in uneasiness any longer. It was simple. He hated Roark. The reasons? It was not necessary to wonder about the reasons. It was necessary only to hate, to hate blindly, to hate patiently, to hate without anger; only to hate, and let nothing intervene, and not let oneself forget, ever.

He liked the work. He felt at times as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and the granite. He was very tired at night. He liked the emptiness of his body's exhaustion.

She had lost the freedom she loved. She knew that a continuous struggle against the compulsion of a single desire was compulsion also, but it was the form she preferred to accept.

WHEN Peter Keating entered the office, the opening of the door sounded like a single high blast on a trumpet. The door flew forward as if it had opened of itself to the approach of a man before whom all doors were to open in such manner.

You must learn to know me better. Strange as it may sound, a totally selfless interest in one's fellow men is possible in this world, Peter.”.

“A thing is not high if one can reach it; it is not great if one can reason about it; it is not deep if one can see its bottom”--this had always been his credo, unstated and unquestioned.

“A thing is not high if one can reach it; it is not great if one can reason about it; it is not deep if one can see its bottom”--this had always been his credo, unstated and unquestioned. This spared him any attempt to reach, reason or see; and it cast a nice reflection of scorn on those who made the attempt.

“Ah, there's nothing like tea in the afternoon. When the British Empire collapses, historians will find that it had made but two invaluable contributions to civilization--this tea ritual and the detective novel.

Not by what we are shall we be judged, but by those we serve.

It was as if they had all been comfortably naked, and a person had entered fully clothed, suddenly making them self-conscious and indecent.

You--Peter, you're everything I despise in the world and I don't want to remember how much I despise it.

Soul...There's nothing important on earth, except human beings. There's nothing as important about human beings as their relations to one another....”.

“Kindness, Peter,” said the voice softly, “kindness. That is the first commandment, perhaps the only one. That is why I had to pan that new play, in my column yesterday. That play lacked essential kindness. We must be kind, Peter, to everybody around us. We must accept and forgive--there is so much to be forgiven in each one of us. If you learn to love everything, the humblest, the least, the meanest, then the meanest in you will be loved. Then we'll find the sense of universal equality, the great peace of brotherhood, a new world, Peter, a beautiful new world....”.

The secret sorrow of his life was that he did not head a business of his own.

The secret sorrow of his life was that he did not head a business of his own. But he was a quiet, conscientious, unimaginative man, and an early marriage had ended all his ambition.

He considered athletics vulgar and said so; the brain, he said, was mightier than the brawn; he meant it.

For years the school did not refer to a promising boy as a good speaker, but as “a Toohey.”.

Once, after beating Willie Lovett with the affirmative of “The Pen Is Mightier than the Sword,” he challenged Willie to reverse their positions, took the negative and won again.,.

“What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”.

“Then in order to be truly wealthy, a man should collect souls?”.

At the age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in religion. He discovered socialism.

People did not question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for granted that such reasons existed.

People came to him; he came close to no one. He accepted all. His affection was golden, smooth and even, like a great expanse of sand; there was no wind of discrimination to raise dunes; the sands lay still and the sun stood high.

“I'm a dangerous person. Somebody ought to warn you against me,”.

“Don't worry. They're all against me. But I have one advantage: they don't know what they want. I do.”.

“I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't. But to come back to love. Personal love, Peter, is a great evil--as everything personal. And it always leads to misery. Don't you see why? Personal love is an act of discrimination, of preference. It is an act of injustice--to every human being on earth whom you rob of the affection arbitrarily granted to one. You must love all men equally. But you cannot achieve so noble an emotion if you don't kill your selfish little choices. They are vicious and futile--since they contradict the first cosmic law--the basic equality of all men.”.

“You mean you saw the things I've done, and you like them--you--yourself--alone--without anyone telling you that you should like them or why you should like them--and you decided that you wanted me, for that reason--only for that reason--without knowing anything about me or giving a damn--only because of the things I've done and...and what you saw in them--only because of that, you decided to hire me, and you went to the bother of finding me and coming here, and being insulted--only because you saw--and what you saw made me important to you, made you want me? Is that what you mean?”.

“Because...” Mallory roared suddenly, and then his voice broke, and his head dropped, and he finished in a flat whisper: “because I've spent two years”--his hand circled limply indicating the room--“that's how I've spent them--trying to get used to the fact that what you're trying to tell me doesn't exist....”.

“You're a God-damn fool. You have no right to care what I think of your work, what I am or why I'm here. You're too good for that. But if you want to know it--I think you're the best sculptor we've got. I think it, because your figures are not what men are, but what men could be--and should be. Because you've gone beyond the probable and made us see what is possible, but possible only through you. Because your figures are more devoid of contempt for humanity than any work I've ever seen. Because you have a magnificent respect for the human being. Because your figures are the heroic in man. And so I didn't come here to do you a favor or because I felt sorry for you or because you need a job pretty badly. I came for a simple, selfish reason--the same reason that makes a man choose the cleanest food he can find. It's a law of survival, isn't it?--to seek the best. I didn't come for your sake. I came for mine.”.

Well?...That a great many men are poor fools who can't see the best--that's nothing.

“Just one figure. It will stand here.” He pointed to a sketch. “The place is built around it. The statue of a naked woman. If you understand the building, you understand what the figure must be. The human spirit. The heroic in man. The aspiration and the fulfillment, both. Uplifted in its quest--and uplifting by its own essence. Seeking God--and finding itself. Showing that there is no higher reach beyond its own form....You're the only one who can do it for me.”.

No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that he's a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he's an atheist, or because somebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls wings off bottleflies.

The trouble with you, my dear, and with most people, is that you don't have sufficient respect for the senseless.

The trouble with you, my dear, and with most people, is that you don't have sufficient respect for the senseless. The senseless is the major factor in our lives.

No, you can never ruin an architect by proving that he's a bad architect. But you can ruin him because he's an atheist, or because somebody sued him, or because he slept with some woman, or because he pulls wings off bottleflies. You'll say it doesn't make sense? Of course it doesn't. That's why it works. Reason can be fought with reason. How are you going to fight the unreasonable? The trouble with you, my dear, and with most people, is that you don't have sufficient respect for the senseless. The senseless is the major factor in our lives.

Had you been your old self, you'd tell me, at this point, that that is the psychology of a murderer who's committed the perfect crime and then confesses because he can't bear the idea that nobody knows it's a perfect crime.

Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love, brutality, murder, self-sacrifice. But don't ask them to achieve self-respect.

Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love, brutality, murder, self-sacrifice. But don't ask them to achieve self-respect. They will hate your soul.

The Stoddard Temple must be destroyed. Not to save men from it, but to save it from men.

Let us destroy, but don't let us pretend that we are committing an act of virtue. Let us say that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks. Or, perhaps, that we are lemmings, the animals who cannot help swimming out to self-destruction.

“Certainly, pet. I'm not busy. I'm never too busy for you, anyway. Turn the thing down a bit, will you?”.

Uncle Ellsworth, do people sleep a lot because they're tired or because they want to escape from something?”.

Men are important only in relation to other men, in their usefulness, in the service they render. Unless you understand that completely, you can expect nothing but one form of misery or another.

Get your things ready--you won't need much--don't bother about the makeup, by the way--did you say you looked terrible tonight?--you've never looked lovelier.

But the trial brought a subtle change; many members pointed out that the article in “One Small Voice” had actually brought about the Stoddard lawsuit; and that a man who could force clients to sue was a man to be treated with caution. So it was suggested that Ellsworth Toohey should be invited to address the A.G.A. at one of its luncheons. Some members objected, Guy Francon among them. The most passionate objector was a young architect who made an eloquent speech, his voice trembling with the embarrassment of speaking in public for the first time; he said that he admired Ellsworth Toohey and had always agreed with Toohey's social ideals, but if a group of people felt that some person was acquiring power over them, that was the time to fight such a person. The majority overruled him.

“What do you want me to work on, Howard?” “I want you to work without asking anyone what he wants you to work on.”.

He wanted to know what made these people different from those in his neighborhood. It was not the clothes, the carriages or the banks that caught his notice; it was the books. People in his neighborhood had clothes, horse wagons and money; degrees were inessential; but they did not read books. He decided to learn what was read by the people on Fifth Avenue. One day, he saw a lady waiting in a carriage at the curb; he knew she was a lady--his judgment on such matters was more acute than the discrimination of the Social Register; she was reading a book. He leaped to the steps of the carriage, snatched the book and ran away. It would have taken swifter, slimmer men than the cops to catch him. It was a volume of Herbert Spencer. He went through a quiet agony trying to read it to the end. He read it to the end. He understood one quarter of what he had read. But this started him on a process which he pursued with a systematic, fist-clenched determination. Without advice, assistance or plan, he began reading an incongruous assortment of books; he would find some passage which he could not understand in one book, and he would get another on that subject. He branched out erratically in all directions; he read volumes of specialized erudition first, and high-school primers afterward. There was no order in his reading; but there.

“Peter Keating is the luckiest fellow on earth.” How often had he heard that?.

People want nothing but mirrors around them.

People want nothing but mirrors around them. To reflect them while they're reflecting too. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage.

As a matter of fact, the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind.

As a matter of fact, the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind. He expects nothing of men, so no form of depravity can outrage him.”.

She did not smile, but her face had the lovely serenity that can become a smile without transition.

“Power, Dominique. The only thing I ever wanted. To know that there's not a man living whom I can't force to do--anything. Anything I choose. The man I couldn't break would destroy me. But I've spent years finding out how safe I am. They say I have no sense of honor, I've missed something in life. Well, I haven't missed very much, have I? The thing I've missed--it doesn't exist.”.

He was a very young man. He had just graduated from college--in this spring of the year 1935--and he wanted to decide whether life was worth living. He did not know that this was the question in his mind. He did not think of dying. He thought only that he wished to find joy and reason and meaning in life--and that none had been offered to him anywhere. He had not liked the things taught to him in college. He had been taught a great deal about social responsibility, about a life of service and self-sacrifice. Everybody had said it was beautiful and inspiring. Only he had not felt inspired. He had felt nothing at all. He could not name the thing he wanted of life. He felt it here, in this wild loneliness. But he did not face nature with the joy of a healthy animal--as a proper and final setting; he faced it with the joy of a healthy man--as a challenge; as tools, means and material. So he felt anger that he should find exultation only in the wilderness, that this great sense of hope had to be lost when he would return to men and men's work. He thought that this was not right; that man's work should be a higher step, an improvement on nature, not a degradation. He did not want to despise men; he wanted to love and admire them. But he dreaded the sight of the first house, poolroom and movie poster he would encounter on his way. He had always wanted to write music, and he could give no other identity to the thing he sought. If you want to know what it is, he told himself, listen to the first phrases of Tchaikovsky's First Concerto--or the last movement of Rachmaninoff's Second. Men have not found the words for it nor the deed nor the thought, but they have found the music. Let me see that in one single act of man on earth. Let me see it made real. Let me see the answer to the promise of that music. Not servants nor those served; not altars and immolations; but the final, the fulfilled, innocent of pain. Don't help me or serve me, but let me see it once, because I need it. Don't work for my happiness, my brothers--show me yours--show me that it is possible--show me your achievement--and the knowledge will give me courage for mine. He saw a blue hole ahead, where the road ended on the crest of a ridge. The blue looked cool and clean like a film of water stretched in the frame of green branches. It would be funny, he thought, if I came to the edge and found nothing but that blue beyond; nothing but the sky ahead, above and below. He closed his eyes and went on, suspending the possible for a moment, granting himself a dream, a few instants of believing.

For the man who understands this, a house he owns is a statement of his life. If he doesn't build, when he has the means, it's because his life has not been what he wanted.”.

“Most people build as they live--as a matter of routine and senseless accident. But a few understand that building is a great symbol. We live in our minds, and existence is the attempt to bring that life into physical reality, to state it in gesture and form. For the man who understands this, a house he owns is a statement of his life. If he doesn't build, when he has the means, it's because his life has not been what he wanted.”.

“I didn't either. I minded something else. Did you want to scream, when you were a child, seeing nothing but fat ineptitude around you, knowing how many things could be done and done so well, but having no power to do them? Having no power to blast the empty skulls around you? Having to take orders--and that's bad enough--but to take orders from your inferiors! Have you felt that?”.

“THE BASIC trouble with the modern world,” said Ellsworth Toohey, “is the intellectual fallacy that freedom and compulsion are opposites.

Traffic lights restrain your freedom to cross a street whenever you wish. But this restraint gives you the freedom from being run over by a truck.

Traffic lights restrain your freedom to cross a street whenever you wish. But this restraint gives you the freedom from being run over by a truck. If you were assigned to a job and prohibited from leaving it, it would restrain the freedom of your career. But it would give you freedom from the fear of unemployment.

“THE BASIC trouble with the modern world,” said Ellsworth Toohey, “is the intellectual fallacy that freedom and compulsion are opposites. To solve the gigantic problems crushing the world today, we must clarify our mental confusion. We must acquire a philosophical perspective. In essence, freedom and compulsion are one. Let me give you a simple illustration. Traffic lights restrain your freedom to cross a street whenever you wish. But this restraint gives you the freedom from being run over by a truck. If you were assigned to a job and prohibited from leaving it, it would restrain the freedom of your career. But it would give you freedom from the fear of unemployment. Whenever a new compulsion is imposed upon us, we automatically gain a new freedom. The two are inseparable. Only by accepting total compulsion can we achieve total freedom.”.

“What I mean is, what makes people unhappy is not too little choice, but too much,” said Mitchell Layton. “Having to decide, always to decide, torn every which way all of the time.

“I might. If you offer me enough.” “Howard--anything you ask. Anything. I'd sell my soul...” “That's the sort of thing I want you to understand. To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul--would you understand why that's much harder?”.

“Then here's what I'm offering you: I'll design Cortlandt. You'll put your name on it. You'll keep all the fees. But you'll guarantee.

“Then here's what I'm offering you: I'll design Cortlandt. You'll put your name on it. You'll keep all the fees. But you'll guarantee that it will be built exactly as I design it.”.

They have the nicest watercress sandwiches.”.

Don't want me to start some sort of recriminations?.

“Yes! And isn't that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he's honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he's great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. The man whose sole aim is to make money. Now I don't see anything evil in a desire to make money. But money is only a means to some end. If a man wants it for a personal purpose--to invest in his industry, to create, to study, to travel, to enjoy luxury--he's completely moral. But the men who place money first go much beyond that. Personal luxury is a limited endeavor. What they want is ostentation: to show, to stun, to entertain, to impress others. They're second-handers. Look at our so-called cultural endeavors. A lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him--and the people who listen and don't give a damn, but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name. All second-handers.”.

A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others.

What was his aim in life? Greatness--in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy--all that which comes from others.

What was his aim in life? Greatness--in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy--all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn't want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn't want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There's your actual selflessness. It's his ego he's betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.”.

A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesn't need it.”.

It's so easy to run to others. It's so hard to stand on one's own record. You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in your own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. They run from it. They spend their lives running. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement. It's simple to seek substitutes for competence--such easy substitutes: love, charm, kindness, charity. But there is no substitute for competence.”.

When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life.

“That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They're concerned only with people. They don't ask: 'Is this true?' They ask: 'Is this what others think is true?' Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You don't think through another's brain and you don't work through another's hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation--anchored to nothing. That's the emptiness I couldn't understand in people. That's what stopped me whenever I faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It's everywhere and nowhere and you can't reason with him. He's not open to reason. You can't speak to him--he can't hear. You're tried by an empty bench. A blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose. Steve Mallory couldn't define the monster, but he knew. That's the drooling beast he fears. The second-hander.”.

A man like Roark is on trial before society all his life. Whom does that indict--Roark or society?”.

If you learn how to rule one single man's soul, you can get the rest of mankind.

If you learn how to rule one single man's soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It's the soul, Peter, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That's why the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which can't be ruled. It must be broken. Drive a wedge in, get your fingers on it--and the man is yours. You won't need a whip--he'll bring it to you and ask to be whipped. Set him in reverse--and his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it's done? See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven't heard all this for years, but didn't want to hear, and the fault is yours, not mine. There are many ways. Here's one. Make man feel small. Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That's difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructive of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will. His every living instinct screams against it. But don't you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he's incapable of what he's accepted as the noblest virtue--and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp, he gives up eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he can't practice. But one can't be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one's integrity is a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its self-respect. You've got him. He'll obey. He'll be glad to obey--because he can't trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That's one way. Here's another. Kill man's sense of values. Kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can't be ruled. We don't want any great men. Don't deny the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the difficult, the exceptional. Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept--and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection. Laugh at Roark and hold Peter Keating as a great architect. You've destroyed architecture. Build up Lois Cook and you've destroyed literature. Hail Ike and you've destroyed the theater. Glorify Lancelot Clokey and you've destroyed the press. Don't set out to raze all shrines--you'll frighten men. Enshrine mediocrity--and the shrines are razed. Then there's another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It's simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. Don't let anything remain sacred in a man's soul--and his soul won't be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you've killed the hero in man. One doesn't reverence with a giggle. He'll obey and he'll set no limits to his obedience--anything goes--nothing is too serious. Here's another way. This is most important. Don't allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from them whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying I want' is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this. Unhappy men will come to you. They'll need you. They'll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man's soul--and the space is yours to fill. I don't see why you should look so shocked, Peter. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn't they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy? Under all the complications of verbiage, haven't they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven't you been able to catch their theme song--'Give up, give up, give up, give up'? Look at the moral atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy--and you've damned it. That's how far we've come. We've tied happiness to guilt. And we've got mankind by the throat. Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace--lie on a bed of nails--go into the desert to mortify the flesh--don't dance--don't go to the movies on Sunday--don't try to get rich--don't smoke--don't drink. It's all the same line. The great line. Fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there's always a purpose in nonsense. Don't bother to examine a folly--ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you must dress it up. You must tell people that they'll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don't have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words. 'Universal Harmony'--'Eternal Spirit'--'Divine Purpose'--'Nirvana'--'Paradise'--'Racial Supremacy'--'The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.' Internal corruption, Peter. That's the oldest one of all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. Yet the test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice--run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there's service, there's someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy, that it's your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself--that will be the man who's not after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you'll scream your empty heads off, howling that he's a selfish monster. So the racket is safe for many, many centuries. But here you might have noticed something. I said, 'It stands to reason.' Do you see? Men have a weapon against you. Reason. So you must be very sure to take it away from them. Cut the props from under it. But be careful. Don't deny outright. Never deny anything outright, you give your hand away. Don't say reason is evil--though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. Just say that reason is limited. That there's something above it. What? You don't have to be too clear about it either.  The field's inexhaustible.  'Instinct'--'Feeling'--'Revelation'--'Divine Intuition'--'Dialectic Materialism.' If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesn't make sense--you're ready for him. You tell him that there's something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild. Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You've got him. Can you rule a thinking man? We don't want any thinking men.”.

A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who'll have no desires--around the globe, Peter.

Divide and conquer--first. But then--unite and rule.

To think, to feel, to judge, to act are functions of the ego.

Achievement. "Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see others suffer--in order that he may be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism. The creator is not concerned with disease, but with life. Yet the work of the creators has eliminated one form of disease after another, in man's body and spirit, and brought more relief from suffering than any altruist could ever conceive. "Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. "Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense, and.

# The Last Lecture (Randy Pausch)

Throughout my academic career, I’d given some pretty good talks. But being considered the best speaker in a computer science department is like being known as the tallest of the Seven Dwarfs.

In fact, growing up, I thought there were two types of families: 1) Those who need a dictionary to get through dinner. 2) Those who don’t.

In fact, growing up, I thought there were two types of families: 1) Those who need a dictionary to get through dinner. 2) Those who don’t. We were No. 1. Most every night, we’d end up consulting the dictionary, which we kept on a shelf just six steps from the table. “If you have a question,” my folks would say, “then find the answer.”.

My dad was also an incredible storyteller, and he always said that stories should be told for a reason.

I quote my father to people almost every day. Part of that is because if you dispense your own wisdom, others often dismiss it; if you offer wisdom from a third party, it seems less arrogant and more acceptable. Of course, when you have someone like my dad in your back pocket, you can’t help yourself. You quote him every chance you get.

“This is my son. He’s a doctor, but not the kind who helps people.”.

When I was studying for my PhD, I took something called “the theory qualifier,” which I can now definitively say was the second worst thing in my life after chemotherapy. When I complained to my mother about how hard and awful the test was, she leaned over, patted me on the arm and said, “We know just how you feel, honey. And remember, when your father was your age, he was fighting the Germans.” After I got my PhD, my mother took great relish in introducing me by saying: “This is my son. He’s a doctor, but not the kind who helps people.”.

Have something to bring to the table, because that will make you more welcome.

When you see yourself doing something badly and nobody’s bothering to tell you anymore, that’s a bad place to be.

When you see yourself doing something badly and nobody’s bothering to tell you anymore, that’s a bad place to be. You may not want to hear it, but your critics are often the ones telling you they still love you and care about you, and want to make you better.

It’s not something you can give; it’s something they have to build.

But I was hugely impressed. Kirk, I mean, Shatner, was the ultimate example of a man who knew what he didn’t know, was perfectly willing to admit it, and didn’t want to leave until he understood. That’s heroic to me. I wish every grad student had that attitude.

The film explains that when Kirk was a cadet, he reprogrammed the simulation because “he didn’t believe in the no-win scenario.”.

The brick walls are there for a reason. They’re not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.


# Indian Mutual Funds Handbook (5th Edition): A Guide for Industry Professionals and Intelligent Investors (Sankaran, Sundar)

As a thumb-rule, in the Indian context it is difficult for an AMC to break-even if its AUM is below 10,000 crore.

In one of the securities market scams, a large provident fund investor parted with some of its funds without gaining custody of the securities where they were supposed to have invested. When the scam broke out, they realized that the money was gone, but they did not have the securities. The custodian in the mutual fund structure is in a position to prevent such risks.

What shares are for a company, units are for a mutual fund scheme. Thus, investors invest in a scheme by buying its units; they disinvest by selling its units. The total outstanding units of a scheme multiplied by the face value of its units, constitutes the unit capital of the scheme.

There are as many risk-level options among mutual fund schemes as the waterlevel options in the milk sold by the unorganised milk sector in India!.

Sale price is the price at which an open-end scheme will sell new units to an investor; Re-purchase price is the price at which an investor can return her units to an open-end scheme. As per current SEBI guidelines, the Sale Price is equal to the NAV.

Every sale or re-purchase transaction results in a change in the unit capital of the scheme. The unit capital increases, when additional units are sold; and decreases if existing units are re-purchased.

Withdrawals from the NPS are tax-exempt upto 40% of the corpus, provided the pensioner has attained the age of 60.

A staggering 53% of the assets continue to be in debt schemes.

“A great patients’ drug is one that cures an affliction once and for all, but a great investor’s drug is one that the patient has to keep buying.”.

“According to Mark Twain, October is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August,.

When the probability of a future event can be assessed, it is risk.

When the probability of a future event can be assessed, it is risk. When the probability is indefinite or indeterminate, it is uncertainty.

“The risk of paying too high a price for good-quality stocks — while a real one — is not the chief hazard confronting the average buyer of securities. Observation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low quality securities at times of favourable business conditions.”.

Before you invest, you must ensure that you have realistically assessed your probability of being right, and how you will react to the consequences of being wrong.

“in making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities. We never know the future.”.

For most people, investing on the basis of protection — from overpaying for a stock, and from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment — is the best solution. ..

The second, or protective, approach may be called the quantitative or statistical approach, since it emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and earnings, assets, dividends, and so forth. . . .”.

Some analysts view PEG of 1 or less as a desirable metric for investing in a company’s equity shares.

“Earnings are only a means to an end. Therefore we must say that a stock derives its value from its dividends, not its earnings. In short, a stock is worth only what you can get out of it.”.

“The one principle that applies to nearly all these so-called ‘technical approaches’ is that one should buy because a stock or the market has gone up, and one should sell because it has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business sense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to lasting success on Wall Street. . . .” 29.

A lot of these quantitative models look sexy on paper.

Under this scheme, account can be opened in the name of a girl child up to 10 years of age, in a bank or post office. A guardian can open only one account in the name of one girl child and maximum two accounts in the name of two different girl children. Deposits are entitled to deduction under Section 80C. Deposits can be made until she completes 14 years of age. On attaining the age of 10 years, she herself can operate the account. The account can be closed when she completes 21 years of age. However, after she attains the age of 18 years, 50% of the fund can be withdrawn for her higher education and marriage. Interest rate is currently 8.1% p.a., tax-free. Annual limits for investment are minimum 1,000, and maximum 150,000.

“Americans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two people to carry ten dollars’ worth of groceries. Today, a five-year old can do it: Henry Youngman.”.

“Two of the most lucrative businesses in the world are buying whiskey by the bottle and selling it by the shot, and buying land by the acre and selling it by the plot.”.

This accounting treatment is called “amortisation”.

Why not, therefore, spread the initial issue expenses over the period of the scheme? This accounting treatment is called “amortisation”.

A third possibility is to charge the initial expense to the scheme, but spread the impact over a period. This can be justified on the ground that the initial issue expenses were incurred to get subscriptions into the scheme, which could continue for a period of time. Why not, therefore, spread the initial issue expenses over the period of the scheme? This accounting treatment is called “amortisation”.

Mutual funds need to disclose in their website, in downloadable spreadsheet format, the TER of all their schemes on a daily basis.

While charging the load, the scheme cannot differentiate between unit holders on the basis of amount of subscription. Load cannot be charged on bonus units, and units allotted on re-investment of dividend.

Hurt badly by the crash of 2000-2002, many investors now view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of crashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot milk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.”.

# Six Easy Pieces (Richard P. Feynman)

In earlier centuries Isaac Newton was an icon. Newton personified the gentleman scientist—well connected, devoutly religious, unhurried, and methodical in his work. His style of doing science set the standard for two hundred years. In the first half of the twentieth century Albert Einstein replaced Newton as the popular scientist icon. Eccentric, dishevelled, Germanic, absent-minded, utterly absorbed in his work, and an archetypal abstract thinker, Einstein changed the way that physics is done by questioning the very concepts that define the subject.


# The Pleasure of Finding Things Out (Richard P. Feynman)

I had not expected to meet Shakespeare on American soil, but I had no difficulty in recognizing him when I saw him.

“You see? That’s why scientists persist in their investigations, why we struggle so desperately for every bit of knowledge, stay up nights seeking the answer to a problem, climb the steepest obstacles to the next fragment of understanding, to finally reach that joyous moment of the kick in the discovery, which is part of the pleasure of finding things out.”* Feynman always said that he did physics not for the glory or for awards and prizes but for the fun of it, for the sheer pleasure of finding out how the world works, what makes it tick.

Rue Saint-Jacques is likely the oldest road in Paris, and it has a rich literary history. Victor Hugo lived a few blocks from where I’m sitting. Gertrude Stein drank coffee and F. Scott Fitzgerald socialized within a stone’s throw. Hemingway wandered up and down the sidewalks, his books percolating in his mind, wine no doubt percolating in his blood.

The guests included chess prodigies, movie stars, four-star generals, pro athletes, and hedge fund managers. It was a motley crew.

“If you want to be successful, surround yourself with people who are more successful than you are, but if you want to be happy, surround yourself with people who are less successful than you are.”.

“The first rule of handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict. . . . All of the value in life, including in relationships, comes from compound interest. People who regularly fight with others will eventually fight with you. I’m not interested in anything that’s unsustainable or even hard to sustain, including difficult relationships.”.

# Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life (Héctor García;Francesc Miralles)

Our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.

According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations. Members of these communities manage their.

According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations.

Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and interacting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the mind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater mental benefits.

“treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.”.

Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular, moderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of the joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and cherishing each new day is their ikigai.

For example, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120 years.

Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and neural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to our surroundings.

Presented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is revitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if stepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety.

Are online or waiting for notifications from their cell phones twenty-four hours a day..

“We have to learn to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop. We all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news. You ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,”.

One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.

Walk to work, or just go on a walk for at least twenty minutes each day.

Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator. This is good for your posture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things.

Participate in social or leisure activities so that you don’t spend too much time in front of the television.

Replace your junk food with fruit and you’ll have less of an urge to snack, and more nutrients in your system.

Get the right amount of sleep. Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than that makes us lethargic.

Play with children or pets, or join a sports team. This not only strengthens the body but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem.

Be conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and replace them with more positive ones.

A positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness.

A positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way toward longevity.

A stoic attitude—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior.

The answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live.

Study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both patients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings needed a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone or something in their lives worth dying for.2.

“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”.

“He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.”.

Excessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire from being fulfilled.

Humor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety.

We all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the equation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in which we find ourselves.

Frankl asked him what would have happened if he had been the one who died first.

“You see, doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for this is to survive, and mourn her.”.

Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them, since their feelings will change as a result of their actions.

“In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.”.

Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following fable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort.

“If we try to get rid of one wave with another, we end up with an infinite sea.”.

“Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you.”.

“Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That is relativity.”.

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the employees don’t know what their objectives are.

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the employees don’t know what their objectives are. What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they don’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no destination.

“In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go.

One common example of this is writer’s block. Imagine that a writer has to finish a novel in three months. The objective is clear; the problem is that the writer can’t stop obsessing over it. Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to write that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and cleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to work the next day.

Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to write that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and cleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to work the next day. Days, weeks, and months pass, and the writer still hasn’t gotten anything down on the page, when all it would have taken was to sit down and get that first word out, then the second . . . to flow with the project, expressing her ikigai. As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert Einstein, “a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”.

Don’t look at any kind of screen for the first hour you’re awake and the last hour before you go to sleep.

Start your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward.

Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its own place and time. For example, if you’re writing a magazine article, you could do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library in the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night.

What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in common? Simplicity and attention to detail.

Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does?.

They do what they love until their dying day.

The last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he died, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he would have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics or mathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while working on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless pleasure.

Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the expense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles of flow to their lives to an extreme.

Another example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every few years.

Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.

“You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering circuits.”.

One of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is worrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching “nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey.

In fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry about anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss might flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a cloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty thousand we have every day, according to some experts.

We all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how to get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice.

Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind.

“I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”3.

“Please, just let me work!”.

“You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.” —T. H. White, The Once and Future King.

“It’s one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see new things. That’s why there are new paintings.”.

“The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.”.

It is also the only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.

STUDIES FROM THE Blue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise but rather the ones who move the most.

The more resilient we are, the easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our lives.

God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, Courage to change the things which should be changed, and the Wisdom to distinguish the one from the other.

Which centers on the idea that there is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them.

This is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or cracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.

“In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”.

“Happiness is always determined by your heart.”.

“Keep going; don’t change your path.”.

Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.

In the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their energy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose everything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated strong friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to move on at the end of a relationship.

# One Up on Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money In (Peter Lynch)

Own stocks where results depend on ancient fundamentals: a successful company enters new markets, its earnings rise, and the share price follows along.

To my mind, the stock price is the least useful information you can track, and it’s the most widely tracked.

If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings—assuming the company in question has earnings.

If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings—assuming the company in question has earnings. As you’ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.

Happen with the Internet. A big.

A big name or two will capture the territory, the way McDonald’s did with burgers or Schlumberger did with oil services. Shareholders in those triumphant companies will prosper, while shareholders in the laggards, the has-beens, and the should-have-beens will lose money. Perhaps you’ll be clever enough to pick the big winners that join the exclusive club of companies that earn $1 billion a year.

Whenever you invest in any company, you’re looking for its market cap to rise. This can’t happen unless buyers are paying higher prices for the shares, making your investment more valuable. With that in mind, before DotCom.com can turn into a tenbagger, its market cap must increase tenfold, from $10 billion to $100 billion. Once you’ve established this target market cap, you have to ask yourself: What will DotCom.com need to earn to support a $100 billion valuation? To get a ballpark answer, you can apply a generic price/earnings ratio for a fast-growing operation—in today’s heady market, let’s say 40 times earnings.

The first is an offshoot of the old “picks and shovels” strategy: During the Gold Rush, most would-be miners lost money, but people who sold them picks, shovels, tents, and blue jeans (Levi Strauss) made a nice profit.

The first is an offshoot of the old “picks and shovels” strategy: During the Gold Rush, most would-be miners lost money, but people who sold them picks, shovels, tents, and blue jeans (Levi Strauss) made a nice profit. Today, you can look for non-Internet companies that indirectly benefit from Internet traffic (package delivery is an obvious example); or you can invest in manufacturers of switches and related gizmos that keep the traffic moving.

I mention Microsoft and Cisco to add contemporary examples to illustrate a major theme of this book. An amateur investor can pick tomorrow’s big winners by paying attention to new developments at the workplace, the mall, the auto showrooms, the restaurants, or anywhere a promising new enterprise makes its debut. While I’m on the subject, a clarification is in order.

Never invest in any company before you’ve done the homework on the company’s earnings prospects, financial condition, competitive position, plans for expansion, and so forth.

Lately, healthy companies are skimping on their dividends and using the money to buy back their own shares, à la General Electric.

Long-term investing has gotten so popular, it’s easier to admit you’re a crack addict than to admit you’re a short-term investor.

Amgen has become a genuine biotech blue chip, with earnings of $1 billion plus.

It’s foolish to bet we’ve seen the last of the bears, which is why it’s important not to buy stocks or stock mutual funds with money you’ll need to spend in the next twelve months to pay college bills, wedding bills, or whatever. You don’t want to be forced to sell in a losing market to raise cash. When you’re a long-term investor, time is on your side.

If you own good companies that continue to increase their earnings, you’ll do well.

You didn’t have to be a genetic engineer to realize that Amgen had transformed itself from a research lab into a pharmaceutical manufacturer with two best-selling drugs.

Stop listening to professionals! Twenty years in this business convinces me that any normal person using the customary three percent of the brain can pick stocks just as well, if not better, than the average Wall Street expert.

It means ignoring the stocks that you hear Peter Lynch, or some similar authority, is buying.

The first stock I ever bought, Flying Tiger Airlines, turned out to be a multibagger that put me through graduate school.

Whenever Lynch advances, the market declines.

Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who’ve been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage.

Logic is the subject that’s helped me the most in picking stocks, if only because it taught me to identify the peculiar illogic of Wall Street. Actually Wall Street thinks just as the Greeks did. The early Greeks used to sit around for days and debate how many teeth a horse has. They thought they could figure it out by just sitting there, instead of checking the horse. A lot of investors sit around and debate whether a stock is going up, as if the financial muse will give them the answer, instead of checking the company.

Soon enough I became known as the Will Rogers of equities, the man who never saw a stock he didn’t like.

“Don’t gamble; take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”.

To the list of famous oxymorons—military intelligence, learned professor, deafening silence, and jumbo shrimp—I’d add professional investing.

In fact, between the chance of making an unusually large profit on an unknown company and the assurance of losing only a small amount on an established company, the normal mutual-fund manager, pension-fund manager, or corporate-portfolio manager would jump at the latter. Success is one thing, but it’s more important not to look bad if you fail. There’s an unwritten rule on Wall Street: “You’ll never lose your job losing your client’s money in IBM.”.

Almost by definition the result will be mediocre, but acceptable mediocrity is far more comfortable than diverse performance.

I am reminded here of the Vonnegut short story in which various highly talented practitioners are deliberately held back (the good dancers wear weights, the good artists have their fingers tied together, etc.) so as not to upset the less skillful.

There’s an unwritten rule that the bigger the client, the more talking the portfolio manager has to do to please him.

For instance, the SEC says a mutual fund such as mine cannot own more than ten percent of the shares in any given company, nor can we invest more than five percent of the fund’s assets in any given stock.

When you ask a bank to handle your investments, mediocrity is all you’re going to get in a majority of the cases.

In other words, I continue to think like an amateur as frequently as possible.

Historically, investing in stocks is undeniably more profitable than investing in debt. In fact, since 1927, common stocks have recorded gains of 9.8 percent a year on average, as compared to 5 percent for corporate bonds, 4.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.4 percent for Treasury bills.

There’s a logical explanation for this. In stocks you’ve got the company’s growth on your side. You’re a partner in a prosperous and expanding business. In bonds, you’re nothing more than the nearest source of spare change.

There’s a logical explanation for this. In stocks you’ve got the company’s growth on your side. You’re a partner in a prosperous and expanding business. In bonds, you’re nothing more than the nearest source of spare change. When you lend money to somebody, the best you can hope for is to get it back, plus interest.

The relationship between them and McDonald’s begins and ends with the payoff of the debt, and that’s not the exciting part of McDonald’s. Sure, the original bondholders have gotten their money back, the same as they would have with a bank CD, but the original stockholders have gotten rich.

Think of the people who’ve owned McDonald’s bonds over the years. The relationship between them and McDonald’s begins and ends with the payoff of the debt, and that’s not the exciting part of McDonald’s. Sure, the original bondholders have gotten their money back, the same as they would have with a bank CD, but the original stockholders have gotten rich.

You’ll never get a tenbagger in a bond—unless you’re a debt sleuth who specializes in bonds in default.

Six out of ten is all it takes to produce an enviable record on Wall Street.

Before you buy a share of anything, there are three personal issues that ought to be addressed: (1) Do I own a house? (2) Do I need the money? and (3) Do I have the personal qualities that will bring me success in stocks?.

“Never invest in anything that eats or needs repairs”.

It takes a moving van to get out of a house, and only a phone call to get out of a stock.

Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the foreseeable future.

When E.F. Hutton talks, everybody is supposed to be listening, but that’s just the problem. Everybody ought to be trying to fall asleep. When it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here is not listening, it’s snoring. The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed. If not, your only hope for increasing your net worth may be to adopt J. Paul Getty’s surefire formula for financial success: “Rise early, work hard, strike oil.”.

Well, maybe not all economists. Certainly not the ones who are reading this book, and especially not the ones like Ed Hyman at C. J. Lawrence who looks at scrap prices, inventories, and railroad car deliveries, totally ignoring Laffer curves and phases of the moon. Practical economists are economists after my own heart.

Remember, things are never clear until it’s too late.

You don’t have to be a vice president at Exxon to sense the growing prosperity in that company, or a turnaround in oil prices. You can be a roustabout, a geologist, a driller, a supplier, a gas-station owner, a grease monkey, or even a client at the gas pumps.

So often we struggle to pick a winning stock, when all the while a winning.

So often we struggle to pick a winning stock, when all the while a winning stock has been struggling to pick us.

The professional’s edge is especially helpful in knowing when and when not to buy shares in companies that have been around awhile, especially those in the so-called cyclical industries. If you work in the chemical industry, then you’ll be among the first to realize that demand for polyvinyl chloride is going up, prices are going up, and excess inventories are going down. You’ll be in a position to know that no new competitors have entered the market and no new plants are under construction, and that it takes two to three years to build one. All this means higher profits for existing companies that make the product.

Every time I look at the Dreyfus chart, it reminds me of the advice I’ve been trying to give you all along: Invest in things you know about.

Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards.

You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years.

You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years. If you buy Coca-Cola at the right price, you might triple your money in six years, but you’re not going to hit the jackpot in two.

Once I’ve established the size of the company relative to others in a particular industry, next I place it into one of six general categories: slow growers, stalwarts, fast growers, cyclicals, asset plays, and turnarounds.

There are almost as many ways to classify stocks as there are stockbrokers—but I’ve found that these six categories cover all of the useful distinctions that any investor has to make.

“things are more like they are now than they ever were before.”.

Alcoa once had the same kind of go-go reputation that Apple Computer has today, because aluminum was a fast-growth industry.

Another sure sign of a slow grower is that it pays a generous and regular dividend. As I’ll discuss more fully in Chapter 13, companies pay generous dividends when they can’t dream up new ways to use the money to expand the business. Corporate managers would much prefer to expand the business, an effort that always enhances their prestige, than to pay a dividend, an effort that is mechanical and requires no imagination.

I look for the ones that have good balance sheets and are making substantial profits. The trick is figuring out when they’ll stop growing, and how much to pay for the growth.

McDonald’s is a classic fast grower, but because of the thousands of outlets it either owns or is repurchasing from the franchisees, it could be a great future asset play in real estate.

Are you looking for slow growth, fast growth, recession protection, a turnaround, a cyclical bounce, or assets?.

Unless it’s a turnaround, there’s no point in owning a utility and expecting it to do as well as Philip Morris.

Unless it’s a turnaround, there’s no point in owning a utility and expecting it to do as well as Philip Morris. There’s no point in treating a young company with the potential of a Wal-Mart like a stalwart, and selling for a 50 percent gain, when there’s a good chance that your fast grower will give you a 1,000-percent gain.

Unless it’s a turnaround, there’s no point in owning a utility and expecting it to do as well as Philip Morris. There’s no point in treating a young company with the potential of a Wal-Mart like a stalwart, and selling for a 50 percent gain, when there’s a good chance that your fast grower will give you a 1,000-percent gain. On the other hand, if Ralston Purina already has doubled and the fundamentals look unexciting, you’re crazy to hold on to it with the same hope.

Getting the story on a company is a lot easier if you understand the basic business. That’s why I’d rather invest in panty hose than in communications satellites, or in motel chains than in fiber optics. The simpler it is, the better I like it. When somebody says, “Any idiot could run this joint,” that’s a plus as far as I’m concerned, because sooner or later any idiot probably is going to be running it.

If a company with terrific earnings and a strong balance sheet also does dull things, it gives you a lot of time to purchase the stock at a discount. Then when it becomes trendy and overpriced, you can sell your shares to the trend-followers.

That’s a name with promise to begin with—any company that uses a k where there ought to be a c is worth investigating.


# The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway, Ernest)

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

He thus made it possible for the reader to participate imaginatively in the story. That effect was always Hemingway’s primary aim as a writer.

As he had originally planned to do, Hemingway took the external details of the story and presented them from the point of view of the fisherman. He thus made it possible for the reader to participate imaginatively in the story. That effect was always Hemingway’s primary aim as a writer.

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.

Man was now definitely and finally salao,.

“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.” “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?” “I remember everything from when we first went together.”.

“If you were my boy I’d take you out and gamble,” he said. “But you are your father’s and your mother’s and you are in a lucky boat.”.

He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride.

Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.

“What do you have to eat?” the boy asked. “A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?” “No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?” “No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold.” “May I take the cast net?” “Of course.” There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.

“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without eating while I’m alive.” “Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said.

“There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you.”.

He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her.

He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.

All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.

They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.


# Roads to Mussoorie (Bond, Ruskin)

In fact, I urge my readers to start this book with the last chapter and then, if they haven't thrown their hands up in despair, to work their way forwards to the beginning.

For over forty years I've been living in this rather raffish hill-station, and when people ask me why, I usually say 'I forgot to go away.'.

There's something to be said for a place if you've been happy there, and it's nice to be able to record some of the events and people that made for fun and happy living.

Over the years, Mussoorie has changed a little, but not too much. I have changed too, but not too much.

Like Mussoorie, I'm quite accessible. You can find me up at Sisters Bazaar (walking backwards), or at the Cambridge Book Depot (reading backwards), or climbing backwards over Ganesh Saili's gate to avoid the attentions of his high-spirited Labrador.

Like Mussoorie, I'm quite accessible. You can find me up at Sisters Bazaar (walking backwards), or at the Cambridge Book Depot (reading backwards), or climbing backwards over Ganesh Saili's gate to avoid the attentions of his high-spirited Labrador. You are unlikely to find me at my residence. I am seldom there. I have a secret working-place, at a haunted house on the Tehri road, and you can only find it if you keep driving in reverse. But you must look backwards too, or you might just go off the edge of the road.

I don't think I have ever written a good story without a good breakfast.

I don't think I have ever written a good story without a good breakfast. There are of course, writers who do not eat before noon. Both they and their prose have a lean and hungry look.

English breakfasts, unlike continental breakfasts, are best enjoyed in India where you don't have to rush off to catch a bus or a train or get to your office in time.

The ghur was, of course, much healthier than sugar.

Road travel can involve delays and mishaps, but it also provides you with the freedom to stop where you like and do as you like. I have never found it boring. The seven-hour drive from Mussoorie to Delhi can become a little tiring towards the end, but as I do not drive myself, I can sit back and enjoy everything that the journey has to offer.

Those thick windows of frosted glass effectively cut me off from the world outside.

These journeys are seldom without incident. I was sipping a coffee at a wayside restaurant, when a foreign woman walked in, and asked the waiter if they had 'à la carte' . Roadside stops seldom provide menus, nor do they go in for French, but our waiter wanted to be helpful, so he led the tourist outside and showed her the way to the public toilet. As she did not return to the restaurant, I have no idea if she eventually found à la carte.

My author's ego received a salutary beating when on one of my earlier trips, I stopped at a small book-stall and looked around, hoping (like any other author) to spot one of my books. Finally, I found one, under a pile of books by Deepak Chopra, Khushwant Singh, William Dalrymple and other luminaries. I slipped it out from the bottom of the pile and surreptitiously placed it on top. Unfortunately the bookseller had seen me do this. He picked up the offending volume and returned it to the bottom of the pile, saying 'No demand for this book, sir'. I wasn't going to tell him I was the author. But just to prove him wrong, I bought the poor neglected thing.

Other good drivers who have taken me here and there include Ganesh Saili, who is even better after a few drinks; Victor Banerjee who is better before drinks; and young Harpreet who is a fan of Kenny G's saxophone playing.

'Well, I can't hear their horns, but I'll make sure they hear mine!'.

Things are seldom what they seem to be.

He won over the priests when he inaugurated his project with aarti, and the worship of Ganesh, God of Good Beginnings.

Initially, opposition came from the priests in Hardwar, who felt that the waters of the holy Ganga would be imprisoned. Cautley pacified them by agreeing to leave a narrow gap in the dam through which the river water could flow unchecked. He won over the priests when he inaugurated his project with aarti, and the worship of Ganesh, God of Good Beginnings.

And then, his work done, walking away from it all without thought of fame or fortune.

Well, no one uses the old road any more. Walking is out of fashion now. And if you have a car to take you Swiftly up the motor-road Why bother to toil up a disused path? You'd have to be an old romantic like me To want to take that route again. But I did it last year,.

Choose your companions carefully when you are walking in the hills. If you are accompanied by the wrong person—by which I mean someone who is temperamentally very different to you—that long hike you've been dreaming of could well turn into a nightmare.

'Give me a companion of my way, be it only to mention how the shadows lengthen as the sun declines,' wrote Hazlitt.

In the West they say, 'Never talk to strangers.' In the East they say, 'Always talk to strangers.'.

On the open road there are no strangers. You share the same sky, the same mountain, the same sunshine and shade. On the open road we are all brothers.

On another trek, from Mussoorie to Chamba (before the motor-road came into existence) I put two tins of sardines into my knapsack but forgot to take along a can-opener.

They say bears find it easier to run uphill than down.

Sleeping out, under the stars, is a very romantic conception. 'Stones thy pillow, earth thy bed,' goes an old hymn, but a rolled up towel or shirt will make a more comfortable pillow.

The best kind of walk, and this applies to the plains as well as to the hills, is the one in which you have no particular destination when you set out.

The adventure is not in getting somewhere, it's the on-the-way experience. It is not the expected; it's the surprise. Not the fulfilment of prophecy, but the providence of something better than that prophesied.

'All men are my friends. I have only to meet them.' In these hills, where life still moves at a leisurely and civilized pace, one is constantly meeting them.

Usually I did enjoy films based on famous or familiar books. Dickens was a natural for the screen. David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, Nicholas Nickleby, A Tale of Two Cities, Pickwick Papers, A Christmas Carol (Scrooge) all made successful films, true to the originals. Daphne du Maurier's novels also transferred well to the screen. As did Somerset Maugham's works: Of Human Bondage, The Razor's Edge, The Letter, Rain and several others.

What is nostalgia, after all, but an attempt to preserve that which was good in the past?.

No one lives in it at night except for a Gurkha chowkidar, a man of strong nerves who sleeps in the back verandah.

Always a creature of impulse, my life has been shaped more by a benign providence than by any system of foresight or planning.

The right to privacy is a fine concept and might actually work in the West, but in Eastern lands it is purely notional.

The right to privacy is a fine concept and might actually work in the West, but in Eastern lands it is purely notional. If I want to be left alone, I have to be a shameless liar—pretend that I am out of town or, if that doesn't work, announce that I have measles, mumps or some new variety of Asian 'flu.

Afternoon siesta,.

Stimulating conversation in mid-afternoon? Even Socrates would have balked at it.

It's unwise to tell a would-be writer that his memoirs or novel or collected verse would be better off unpublished.

'Dreaded man-eater, shot after it had killed its 26th victim.'.

I have always believed that if a writer is any good he will find a publisher who will print, bind, and sell his books, and even give him a royalty for his efforts.

Have never smoked pot, and have never felt any inclination to do so. One can get a great 'high' from so many other things—falling in love, or reading a beautiful poem, or taking in the perfume of a rose, or getting up at dawn to watch the morning sky and then the sunrise, or listening to great music, or just listening to bird song—it does seen rather pointless having to depend on artificial stimulants for relaxation; but human beings are a funny lot and will often go to great lengths to obtain the sort of things that some would consider rubbish.

I have lived life at my own gentle pace, and if as a result I have failed to get to the top of the mountain (or of anything else), it doesn't matter, the long walk has brought its own sweet rewards; buttercups and butterflies along the way.


# The Young Man and the Sea (Girish Joshi)

My eyes were glowing of the moonlight that divided the sea into two equal halves. Just like my mind that was always divided into two halves. One that believed in destiny and others that believed that sea is for fishes, the sky is for birds, and the sand is for the men. Men like me who have always feared of great depths and great heights. I could swim, but only if it was a four feet deep pool. I was six feet tall with a beer belly, however, I had been a teetotaller all my life.

Good company, learning and experiencing.

I’ll tell you a secret when it comes to machines, these guys are magicians.

# And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer (Fredrik Backman)

“The worst part about growing old is that I don’t get any ideas anymore.”.

Humans are a strange breed in the way our fear of getting old seems to be even greater than our fear of dying.

When a boy is just big enough to know how the world works but still young enough to refuse to accept it.

Noah’s feet don’t touch the ground when his legs dangle over the edge of the bench, but his head reaches all the way to space, because he hasn’t been alive long enough to allow anyone to keep his thoughts on Earth.

Grandpa knows he’ll always manage, because there are two things in life in which Grandpa’s faith is unwavering: mathematics and his grandson.

I never meant for you to read it, to be quite honest. I wrote it just because I was trying to sort out my own thoughts, and I’m the kind of person who needs to see what I’m thinking on paper to make sense of it.

It’s about fear and love, and how they seem to go hand in hand most of the time. Most of all, it’s about time. While we still have.

It’s about fear and love, and how they seem to go hand in hand most of the time. Most of all, it’s about time. While we still have it.

Isn’t that the best of all life’s ages, an old man thinks as he looks at his grandchild. When a boy is just big enough to know how the world works but still young enough to refuse to accept it.

His grandpa is next to him and is incredibly old, of course, so old now that people have given up and no longer nag him to start acting like an adult.

His grandpa is next to him and is incredibly old, of course, so old now that people have given up and no longer nag him to start acting like an adult. So old that it’s too late to grow up. It’s not so bad either, that age.

A group of people calculated how to fly three men to the moon when Grandpa was young, and mathematics took them all the way there and back again. Numbers always lead people back.

The place is strange but everything here is familiar, like someone stole all the things you grew up with and put them into the wrong house.

Grandpa always calls him “Noahnoah” because he likes his grandson’s name twice as much as everyone else’s.

The boy recognizes the flowers, they’re Grandma’s, they smell like Christmas.

For other children maybe that scent would be ginger biscuits and mulled wine, but if you’ve ever had a Grandma who loved things that grew then Christmas will always smell like hyacinths.

The bench is surrounded by trees, because Grandpa loves trees, because trees don’t give a damn what people think.

The girl is standing in front of him and smells like hyacinths, like she’s never been anywhere else. Her hair is old but the wind in it is new, and he still remembers what it felt like to fall in love; that’s the last memory to abandon him. Falling in love with her meant having no room in his own body. That was why he danced.

“I don’t mean it would be hard for you to understand, Noahnoah. I mean it’s hard for me to understand,”.

Noah can see that Grandpa is ashamed the minute.

There’s nothing wrong with being a bit scared, you said, because if you wet yourself it’ll keep the bears away!”.

That’s another of Grandpa’s favorite games, reciting the decimals of pi, the mathematical constant which is the key to calculating the size of a circle. Grandpa loves the magic of it, those key numbers which unlock secrets, open up the entire universe to us. He knows more than two hundred decimals of it by heart; the boy’s record is half that. Grandpa always says that the years will allow them to meet in the middle, when the boy’s thoughts expand and Grandpa’s contract.

Whenever Noah was scared of sleeping, Grandpa would take out a string and tie one end around his arm and the other around the boy’s and promise that if Noah had nightmares he only had to pull on the string and Grandpa would wake up and bring him straight back to safety.

“And you’re still in such a hurry to look at it that you never have time to do the dishes.” “Those who hasten to live are in a hurry to miss,”.

“And you’re still in such a hurry to look at it that you never have time to do the dishes.” “Those who hasten to live are in a hurry to miss,” she sometimes used to whisper to Noah, though he didn’t know what she meant before she was buried.

“The only time you’ve failed is if you don’t try once more.” “Exactly, Noahnoah, exactly. A great thought can never be kept on Earth.”.

“My memories are running away from me, my love, like when you try to separate oil and water. I’m constantly reading a book with a missing page, and it’s always the most important one.”.

“You never became ordinary to me, my love. You were electric shocks and fire.”.

“I’m angry because you think everything happened by chance but there are billions of people on this planet and I found you so if you’re saying I could just as well have found someone else then I can’t bear your bloody mathematics!”.

“I’m angry because you think everything happened by chance but there are billions of people on this planet and I found you so if you’re saying I could just as well have found someone else then I can’t bear your bloody mathematics!” Her fists had been clenched. He stood there looking at her for several minutes. Then he said that he loved her. It was the first time. They never stopped arguing and they never slept apart; he spent an entire working life calculating probabilities and she was the most improbable person he ever met. She turned him upside-down.

“You were never easy, darling difficult sulky you, never diplomatic. You might even have been easy to dislike at times. But no one, absolutely no one, would dare tell me you were hard to love.”.

“Noah has gotten so smart, my love.” “He always has been, it just took you awhile to catch up,” she snorts.

“Do you remember what you said, when we first fell in love, that sleeping was a torment?” “Yes. Because we couldn’t share our sleep. Every morning when I blinked awake, the seconds before I knew where I was were unbearable. Until I knew where you were.”.

“Do you remember what you said, when we first fell in love, that sleeping was a torment?” “Yes. Because we couldn’t share our sleep. Every morning when I blinked awake, the seconds before I knew where I was were unbearable. Until I knew where you were.” She kisses him. “I know that the way home is getting longer and longer every morning. But I loved you because your brain, your world, was always bigger than everyone else’s. There’s still a lot of it left.”.

Not everyone knows that water and sunshine have scents, but they do, you just have to get far enough away from all other smells to realize it.

“We lived an extraordinarily ordinary life.” “An ordinarily extraordinary life.”.

“She got lost in my heart, I think. Couldn’t find her way out. Your grandma always had a terrible sense of direction. She could get lost on an escalator.”.

“Noahnoah, promise me something, one very last thing: once your good-bye is perfect, you have to leave me and not look back. Live your life. It’s an awful thing to miss someone who’s still here.”.

The corners of the boy’s mouth reach his earlobes.

“And I don’t think you need to be scared of forgetting me,” the boy says after a moment’s consideration. “No?” The corners of the boy’s mouth reach his earlobes. “No. Because if you forget me then you’ll just get the chance to get to know me again. And you’ll like that, because I’m actually a pretty cool person to get to know.”.

‘Ted, we’re not going into space because we’re afraid of aliens. We’re going because we’re scared we’re alone.

‘Ted, we’re not going into space because we’re afraid of aliens. We’re going because we’re scared we’re alone. It’s an awfully big universe to be alone in.’ ”.

That’s why we get the chance to spoil our grandchildren, because by doing that we’re apologizing to our children.”.

“You were the first boy I met who knew how to dance. I thought it was probably best to seize the opportunity; who knows how often boys like that turn up?”.

And ask Ted about the guitar.” “It’s too late now.” She laughs inside his brain then. “Darling obstinate you. It’s never too late to ask your son about something he loves.”.

Feel new sympathy for the curmudgeons.

# The Rosie Result (Graeme Simsion)

In the adult world, an uneven distribution of abilities is more valuable than mediocrity at everything.

‘Are you sure you don’t need me to come up?’ she said. In conversation, it is impolite to say, ‘Refer previous answer,’ so I repeated, ‘I need to assess the situation first.’.

Resilience appeared to be the equivalent of toughening up, which, when I was a child, was a general excuse for bullying.

‘Your dad would say not conventionally attractive, which is a good way of putting it, because what people think is attractive is not the same everywhere. In some cultures, being overweight is considered attractive.’.

They had invited Rosie and me to drinks, which Rosie refused, on the basis that she needed to wash her hair. Hair-washing was a standard excuse for avoiding Gene, whom she considered a misogynist pig.

Black T-shirt with the slogan Autistic Lives Matter.

‘And punishments. Remembering that withholding a reward is punishment too. You’re using ABA, right?’.

‘I’m not a person with autism any more than I’m a person with lesbianism. I’m lesbian. I’m autistic. When I get a cold, I have a cold; I’m a person with a cold and I want to get rid of it. Medical help appreciated. But being autistic and lesbian—that’s who I am, and I’m not interested in anyone trying to cure me of who I am.

‘I’m not a person with autism any more than I’m a person with lesbianism. I’m lesbian. I’m autistic. When I get a cold, I have a cold; I’m a person with a cold and I want to get rid of it. Medical help appreciated. But being autistic and lesbian—that’s who I am, and I’m not interested in anyone trying to cure me of who I am. If they force me into conversion therapy—because that’s what ABA is—for being lesbian or for being autistic, they’re abusing me. If they do it to a child, they’re abusing that child.’.

Imagine everyone used wheelchairs except you and society was designed to accommodate them. You’d knock your head on door frames and have to ask for a chair at restaurants. I thought of Hudson and the ski boots.

‘Correct, but what you said was so spectacular that I may have forgotten it.’.

Facilitators generally think that finishing with applause is more important than completing the agenda.

You’re either autistic or neurotypical.

Diagnosis is for diseases.’.

‘Neither. I consider tribalism one of the worst aspects of human behaviour. A major contributor to confirmation bias, lack of innovation in public policy, war…’.

‘People don’t always mention their motivations. They don’t always know them. That’s why I have a job.’.

Cause célèbre.

Take my mind off my own life.’.

It was the equivalent of me accepting unhappiness now because life would improve after the age of eighty-one.

If I knew then what I know now.

Religious and political positions presented as fact;.

We admit it—Donald Tillman is right. We will abolish the hair-length specification, remove God from the school prayer and make Donald head boy.

Negotiating with a justifiably angry and emotionally unstable eleven-year-old to separate him from time with his mother while not revealing that his preferred outcome would cost her the job she had travelled across the world to take.

I retrieved the ratchet from its case and demonstrated its use, along with the relative advantages of socket, open, ring and adjustable spanners.

One of my teachers had presented Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ as a specification for manhood, with its claim that a fully configured male should be willing not only to gamble but to wager his entire pile of winnings on a single event with a fifty per cent probability of success. Then and now, Kipling seemed to be describing a personality fault that would warrant professional intervention. Rosie would not have responded to such recklessness on my part by complimenting me on my manliness.

Rational people, if they have all the information and the brainpower to process it, should reach similar conclusions.

Rational people, if they have all the information and the brainpower to process it, should reach similar conclusions. But science is so complex that most of us are forced to rely on authorities. The theory that pharmaceutical companies would cover up side effects to promote vaccines is plausible.’.

If someone tells you that their dog has died, the appropriate response is to say you’re sorry to hear that and ask about their feelings rather than to demand details of the circumstances.

People with autism often have poor physical co-ordination.

As a teenager, I had been given the relevant facts, primarily by other children and often in the context of jokes, but had somehow failed to absorb them, and was left confused and disgusted.

‘Pa wants me to remember him every time I see affect or effect used incorrectly.’.

‘Remember when you let that little disabled boy win the karate tournament? Your father was so proud of you.’.

My father would probably have assessed that I appreciated his help, but my co-operation was motivated by my desire for his approval.

Was pleased with my analysis but unhappy with the conclusion.

I had continued to reflect on my feelings about my father trying to mould me into something that he considered desirable. He was, in retrospect, largely right, but emotionally—meaning irrationally—I had resented it. If Hudson was in the same position, I would be wasting my time trying to convince him of the value of the skills I was teaching him. I had learned, reluctantly and over many years, that rational argument seldom overcame irrational resistance.

‘Correct. Gay men are famous for their expertise in style and etiquette, even for straight people.’.

I had not planned to do so, but the idea seemed good, except that Rosie had just rejected it.

Resilience, in my experience, was seldom the reason to do anything. It was only ever stated as a goal after some action that required it had occurred or been committed to.

But…well…change is a fact of life, isn’t it, so maybe the move will help to build his resilience. But that’s not the reason.’ Resilience, in my experience, was seldom the reason to do anything. It was only ever stated as a goal after some action that required it had occurred or been committed to.

‘I can’t understand how someone with all your brains didn’t have enough common sense’.

The process for problem-solving is first to explain and explore the situation and objectives. We can ask questions and share information, but we can’t propose solutions. Then we require an incubation period for subconscious problem-solving, during which we undertake some mundane activity. As we have only one day total, I recommend we allow three to four hours. Then we co-operate on finding solutions.’.

As I had on every anniversary, I gave Rosie a gift according to the published schedule: year thirteen was lace. Hence high-quality running shoes with laces.

‘He’s in danger of becoming an entrepreneur. A capitalist.’.

I might not have seen beyond the rule that promises were not to be broken.

‘Lack of empathy for people different from him. Few people are mean on purpose.’.

Because that’s what we do when someone talks about the things we’re afraid of ourselves. Get them first before they get us.

The gentleman shared a bit of personal information that might have been embarrassing to him, and everybody laughed. Because that’s what we do when someone talks about the things we’re afraid of ourselves. Get them first before they get us.

We’re thinking, now if I share what I’m worried or embarrassed about—not with a whole room of people, because we’re not all as brave as this gentleman, but with a good friend—it won’t be such a big deal.

Give him another round of applause, please.’.

The eye. I should have recognised the.

I should have recognised the situation from my own experiences at school, when victims of bullying did not report it, because the intervention by the authorities would be short-term, but they would continue to encounter the bully daily.

You should run the second half faster than the first. It’s easier to catch up than to try to keep a lead.’.

‘Steady pace is best, with a sprint at the end. But going slow at the start is better than going fast. You should run the second half faster than the first. It’s easier to catch up than to try to keep a lead.’.

None of us is expert in all situations. It is a sign of intelligence to recognise our limitations and of maturity to seek help when required.

‘Altruism. Performing an act because of its intrinsic merit rather than any benefit to yourself. Such as making a donation to charity. An anonymous one.’.

‘Two was that your parents and teachers know heaps more than you do, but they don’t know everything. That’s a problem when you’re a kid and you’re not sure about something important. You have to do research and then decide.

Hudson was right about me not caring about being called ‘weird’. But, despite the term having been used by others in the past year to describe Hudson, I had never thought of him as actually weird—possibly because we might both be weird along the same dimensions.

If Hudson had studied martial arts, he would have known what to do, which was to run away.

‘I’ve already told him it was great,’ said Rosie. ‘So have Dave and Sonia and George and your mother, and I’ve told him that Phil thought it was worth going to hospital for. Your son got virtually a standing ovation, but he’d like to hear from his father as well.’.

For some people, it mattered not only that an initiative was effective, but that the feelings behind it met with their approval.

For some people, it mattered not only that an initiative was effective, but that the feelings behind it met with their approval. These were the people who considered Mother Teresa’s contribution to addressing poverty more important than that of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Your record won’t go on the books, but that’s ok—you’ll know in your heart how high you jumped.


# Boy (Roald Dahl)

He was educated in England before starting work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa.

He began writing after a ‘monumental bash on the head’ sustained as an RAF fighter pilot during the Second World War.

He found it impossible to cut the top off a boiled egg.

The loss of an arm, he used to say, caused him only one serious inconvenience. He found it impossible to cut the top off a boiled egg.

A shipbroker is a person who supplies a ship with everything it needs when it comes into port – fuel and food, ropes and paint, soap and towels, hammers and nails, and thousands of other tiddly little items.

He harboured a curious theory about how to develop a sense of beauty in the minds of his children.

It is astonishing how little one remembers about one’s life before the age of seven or eight. I can tell you all sorts of things that happened to me from eight onwards, but only very few before that.

I promise you that if somebody had caught me by the shoulder at that moment and said to me, ‘What is your greatest wish in life, little boy? What is your absolute ambition? To be a doctor? A fine musician? A painter? A writer? Or the Lord Chancellor?’ I would have answered without hesitation that my only ambition, my hope, my longing was to have a bike like that and to go whizzing down the hill with no hands on the handlebars. It would be fabulous. It made me tremble just to think about it.

When writing about oneself, one must strive to be truthful. Truth is more important than modesty. I must tell you, therefore, that it was I and I alone who had the idea for the great and daring Mouse Plot. We all have our moments of brilliance and glory, and this was mine.

Am only eight years old, I told myself. No little boy of eight has ever murdered anyone. It’s not possible.

My mother, for her part, kept every one of these letters, binding them carefully in neat bundles with green tape, but this was her own secret. She never told me she was doing it. In 1967, when she knew she was dying, I was in hospital in Oxford having a serious operation on my spine and I was unable to write to her. So she had a telephone specially installed beside her bed in order that she might have one last conversation with me. She didn’t tell me she was dying nor did anyone else for that matter because I was in a fairly.

She never told me she was doing it. In 1967, when she knew she was dying, I was in hospital in Oxford having a serious operation on my spine and I was unable to write to her. So she had a telephone specially installed beside her bed in order that she might have one last conversation with me. She didn’t tell me she was dying nor did anyone else for that matter because I was in a fairly serious condition myself at the time. She simply asked me how I was and hoped I would get better soon and sent me her love. I had no idea that she would die the next day, but she knew all right and she wanted to reach out and speak to me for the last time.

When I recovered and went home, I was given this vast collection of my letters, all so neatly bound with green tape, more than six hundred of them altogether, dating from 1925 to 1945, each one in its original envelope with the old stamps still on them. I am awfully lucky to have something like this to refer to in my old age.

The first miserable homesick night at St Peter’s, when I curled up in bed and the lights were put out, I could think of nothing but our house at home and my mother and my sisters. Where were they? I asked myself. In which direction from where I was lying was Llandaff? I began to work it out and it wasn’t difficult to do this because I had the Bristol Channel to help me. If I looked out of the dormitory window I could see the Channel itself, and the big city of Cardiff with Llandaff alongside it lay almost directly across the water but slightly to the north. Therefore, if I turned towards the window I would be facing home. I wriggled round in my bed and faced my home and my family. From then on, during all the time I was at St Peter’s, I never went to sleep with my back to my family. Different beds in different dormitories required the working out of new directions, but the Bristol Channel was always my guide and I was always able to draw an imaginary line from my bed to our house over in Wales. Never once did I go to sleep looking away from my family. It was a great comfort to do this.

‘God works in his mysterious ways,’ she said, which was her stock reply whenever she didn’t know the answer.

Life is tough, and the sooner you learn how to cope with it the better for you.’.

‘You don’t have a father. I do. I am going to write to my father and tell him what has happened and he’ll do something about it.’.

‘You don’t have a father. I do. I am going to write to my father and tell him what has happened and he’ll do something about it.’ ‘He couldn’t do anything,’ I said. ‘Oh yes he could,’ Highton said. ‘And what’s more he will. My father won’t let them get away with this.’ ‘Where is he now?’ ‘He’s in Greece,’ Highton said. ‘In Athens. But that won’t make any difference.’ Then and there, little Highton sat down and wrote to the father he admired so much, but of course nothing came of it. It was nevertheless a touching and generous gesture from one small boy to another.

Pain was something we were expected to endure.

You can consider yourself lucky you don’t have to wear a wig on your head and ruffles on your sleeves.’.

By now I am sure you will be wondering why I lay so much emphasis upon school beatings in these pages. The answer is that I cannot help it. All through my school life I was appalled by the fact that masters and senior boys were allowed literally to wound other boys, and sometimes quite severely. I couldn’t get over it. I never have got over it. It would, of course, be unfair to suggest that all masters were constantly beating the daylights out of all the boys in those days. They weren’t. Only a few did so, but that was quite enough to leave a lasting impression of horror upon me. It left another more physical impression upon me as well. Even today, whenever I have to sit for any length of time on a hard bench or chair, I begin to feel my heart beating along the old lines that the cane made on my bottom some fifty-five years ago.

A boy who is good at games is usually treated with great civility by the masters at an English Public School.

‘All I can say is I’m damned glad I don’t own any shares in Shell.’.

We spent weeks at the huge Shell Haven Refinery with a special instructor who taught us all about fuel oil and diesel oil and gas oil and lubricating oil and kerosene and gasoline.

Enjoyed it, I really did. I began to realize how simple life could be if one had a regular routine to follow with fixed hours and a fixed salary and very little original thinking to do.

I enjoyed it, I really did. I began to realize how simple life could be if one had a regular routine to follow with fixed hours and a fixed salary and very little original thinking to do. The life of a writer is absolute hell compared with the life of a businessman. The writer has to force himself to work. He has to make his own hours and if he doesn’t go to his desk at all there is nobody to scold him. If he is a writer of fiction he lives in a world of fear. Each new day demands new ideas and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not. Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer absolutely drained. For those two hours he has been miles away, he has been somewhere else, in a different place with totally different people, and the effort of swimming back into normal surroundings is very great.

It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him.

It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him. He does it to give himself faith, hope and courage. A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul, and that, I am sure, is why he does it.

None of these things is important, but each of them made such a tremendous impression on me that I have never been able to get them out of my mind.


# Love Among the Bookshelves (Ruskin Bond)

I hereby confess that I am in love with books, and bookshelves are good places to keep them, if not hide them.

This little book is about the books I read and loved when I was a boy and a young man. Books that gave me enjoyment; books that banished loneliness or depression; books that inspired me to become a writer.

During this time, I devoured my first Agatha Christie (Peril at End House), Jack London’s White Fang, Conrad’s Typhoon (which held me enthralled), and a book on gardening—Down the Garden Path by Beverley Nichols.

In time I was to learn that it’s the onlooker who sees more of the party than the partygoer; that it’s the man on traffic duty who sees more of the passing show than the man behind the wheel; that the man on the hilltop sees the curvature of the earth better than the man on the plain; that the hovering vultures know who’s winning the battle long before the opposing armies; and that, when all the wars are done, a butterfly will still be beautiful.

Joie de vivre.

When I wanted romance, I turned to R.L. Stevenson and Daphne du Maurier.

But when I wanted escape—from the routine of boarding-school life, or the conflicts at home—I turned to Wodehouse.


# Forrest Gump (Winston Groom)

Let me say this: bein a idiot is no box of chocolates. People laugh, lose patience, treat you shabby. Now they says folks sposed to be kind to the afflicted, but let me tell you—it ain’t always that way. Even so, I got no complaints, cause I reckon I done live a pretty interestin life, so to speak. I been a idiot since I was born. My IQ is near 70, which qualifies me, so they say. Probly, tho, I’m closer to bein a imbecile or maybe even a moron, but personally, I’d rather think of mysef as like a halfwit, or somethin—an not no idiot—cause when people think of a idiot, more’n likely they be thinkin of one of them Mongolian idiots—the ones with they eyes too close together what look like Chinamen an drool a lot an play with theyselfs.

Writin them, it kinda come out like jello.

Em—all the way from that Doy-chee-eveskie.

Mos of them writer fellers got it straight—cause their idiots always smarter than people give em credit for. Hell, I’d agree with that. Any idiot would. Hee Hee.

An the other kids, they’d never play with me or nothin, cept’n to chase me or get me to start hollerin so’s they could laugh at me—all cept Jenny Curran, who at least didn’t run away from me an sometimes she’d let me walk nex to her goin home after class.

It was like they’d gone aroun collectin all the funny fellers they coud find an put em all together, rangin from my age an younger to big ole boys bout sixteen or seventeen. They was retards of all kinds an spasmos an kids that couldn’t even eat or go to the toilet by theyselfs. I was probly the best of the lot.

Well, they tried splainin it to me, an then one of the goons says to the other that I’m a “dummy” or somethin like that, an I guess he thought I wouldn’t understand him, but I did, on account of I pay special attention to that kind of shit. Not that it hurt my feelins. Hell, I been called a sight worse than that. But I took notice of it, nonetheless.

About the only class I liked was lunch, but I guess you couldn’t call that a class.

“You supposed to be a idiot, how you figure that out?” An I say, “Maybe I am a idiot, but at least I ain’t stupid,” an.

“You supposed to be a idiot, how you figure that out?” An I say, “Maybe I am a idiot, but at least I ain’t stupid,”.

Mostly the trick is in the tongue, lips, fingers and how you move your neck.

They was playin Joan Baez music, an Bob Dylan an Peter, Paul an Mary.

Sometimes, however, a man got to look at the facts.

Well, I reckon I might have figgered that out mysef, but to be honest, it was not somethin I wanted to know. Sometimes, however, a man got to look at the facts.

“Forrest, you may be a shit-for-brains, but you has got to pull this thing out for us. I will personally see that you are made President of the United States or whatever else you want, if you can jus haul that football over the goal line one more time.”.

An it blowed stew all over us, so’s we looked like—well, I don’t know what we looked like—but man, it was strange.

I’m real happy bout the game, but I’m wonderin if Jenny Curran is watchin, an if she is thinkin of me.

However, Sergeant Kranz have said to us time an again that we was not brought over here to understand what is goin on, only to do what we is tole.

It sound real eerie, there in the jungle, playin “Oh Suzanna” an “Home on the Range.”.

The weeks go by so slow I almost think time passin backwards.

I get a letter once a week from my mama. She say everthing fine at home, but that the highschool ain’t won no more championships since I done lef. I write her back too, when I can, but what I’m gonna tell her that won’t start her to bawlin again? So I jus say we is havin a nice time an everbody treatin us fine.

Were Dan’s philosophy that everythin that happen to us, or for that matter, to anythin anywhere, is controlled by natural laws that govern the universe. His views on the subject was extremely complicated, but the gist of what he say begun to change my whole outlook on things.

All my own life, I ain’t understood shit about what was goin on. A thing jus happen, then somethin else happen, then somethin else, an so on, an haf the time nothin makin any sense. But Dan say it is all part of a scheme of some sort, an the best way we can get along is figger out how we fits into the scheme, an then try to stick to our place.

“Yeah, if you can call two punctured lungs, a severed intestin, spinal separation, a missing foot, a truncated leg, an third degree burns over haf the body okay, then he is jus fine.”.

But I read it very carefully anyway, for jus to see her hanwritin is enough to make my stomach turn flip-flops.

When I think back on it now, there is something in your eyes, some tiny flash of fire that comes now and then, mostly when you smile, and, on those infrequent occasions, I believe what I saw was almost a Genesis of our ability as humans to think, to create, to be.

Perhaps by the measure of tests or the judgment of fools, you might fall into some category or other, but deep down, Forrest, I have seen that glowing sparkle of curiosity burning deep in your mind. Take the tide, my friend, and as you are carried along, make it work for you, fight the shallows and the snags and never give in, never give up.

Finally I tap him on the shoulder an when he turn aroun, I say, “Peking Duck,” an start to flap my arms like they is ducks’ wings.

Finally I tap him on the shoulder an when he turn aroun, I say, “Peking Duck,” an start to flap my arms like they is ducks’ wings. All of a sudden, the driver get a big ole smile, an he start noddin an drive off. Ever once in a wile he look back at me, an I start flappin my wings again.

There are jus times when you can’t let the right thing stand in yo way.

It didn’t soun half bad when you was playin it—so long as you didn’t have to listen to it.

It didn’t soun half bad when you was playin it—so long as you didn’t have to listen to it too.

It is called the “Role of the Idiot in World Literature.”.

“Goddamn, Forrest, where is you been all my life?” “I been aroun,” I says.

All of a sudden things start to change for me—like my whole life jus begun, an I am the happiest feller in the world.

“Do It to Me Hard an Fast,”.

Jenny has written a nice tender song called “Do It to Me Hard an Fast,” in which I get to take bout a five-minute ride on my harmonica.

Perhaps I is not cut out to be a rock an roll star. Perhaps, I think, I ain’t nothin but a bumblin idiot anyhow.

Bout nine or ten o’clock they still ain’t fed us no food, an Major Fritch say maybe I ought to go axe Big Sam for our supper. I start to go out the door of the hovel but them two natives cross they spears in front of me, an I get the message an go back inside. Suddenly it dawn on me how come we ain’t been invited to supper—we is the supper. It is a bleak outlook.

They is anythin sure in my life, it is that if we ever get our asses outta here, I don’t never want to be no cotton farmer.

At that, Big Sam be lickin his chops, an it didn’t take no idiot to figger out that if I let him win jus one game, he was gonna be satisfied, an have me for his supper, then an there. Kinda kep me on my toes, if you know what I mean.

She say life has not exactly been a bowl of cherries for her either durin the past few years.

“Oh, Forrest, now I done lost my job!” “Don’t worry none, Mama,” I tole her, “everthin gonna be okay, cause I have got a plan.” “How you gonna have a plan, Forrest?” she say. “You is a idiot. How is a po idiot gonna have a plan?”.

“Oh, Forrest, now I done lost my job!” “Don’t worry none, Mama,” I tole her, “everthin gonna be okay, cause I have got a plan.” “How you gonna have a plan, Forrest?” she say. “You is a idiot. How is a po idiot gonna have a plan?” “Jus wait an see,” I says.

After all, I am a idiot, an wile a lot of people say they is married to idiots, they couldn’t never imagine what would be in store if they ever married a real one.

Sometime durin the night I cried, but it did not hep much.

It’s a stroke of genius, that’s what it is. We Got to Pee is a symbol of riddance of the yoke of government oppression—of evacuation of all that is wrong with this country … It signifies frustration and impending relief!”.

But let me tell you this: sometimes at night, when I look up at the stars, an see the whole sky jus laid out there, don’t you think I ain’t rememberin it all. I still got dreams like anybody else, an ever so often, I am thinkin about how things might of been. An then, all of a sudden, I’m forty, fifty, sixty years ole, you know? Well, so what? I may be a idiot, but most of the time, anyway, I tried to do the right thing—an dreams is jus dreams, ain’t they? So whatever else has happened, I am figgerin this: I can always look back an say, at least I ain’t led no hum-drum life. You know what I mean?.


# I Know Why the Caged Bird Sing (Maya Angelou)

Promise if you’ll just let me speak with you, I won’t take more than five minutes of your time.".

"I am a human being," she would always say, "therefore nothing human is alien to me.".

Why we can all be stirred when the caged bird sings.

The truth of the statement was like a wadded up handkerchief, sopping wet in my fists, and the sooner they accepted it the quicker I could let my hands open and the air would cool my palms.

But I had seen the fingers cut by the mean little cotton bolls, and I had witnessed the backs and shoulders and arms and legs resisting any further demands.

Winced to picture them sewing the coarse material under a coal-oil lamp with fingers stiffening from the day's work.

Then they would face another day of trying to earn enough for the whole year with the heavy knowledge that they were going to end the season as they started it.

Like most children, I thought if I could face the worst danger voluntarily, and triumph, I would forever have power over it.

During these years in Stamps, I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare. He was my first white love.

Pacified myself about his whiteness by saying that after all he had been dead so long it couldn't matter to anyone any more.

I pacified myself about his whiteness by saying that after all he had been dead so long it couldn't matter to anyone any more.

For every bad judgment, the fine was no silver-wrapped Kisses, the sweet chocolate drops that I loved more than anything in the world, except Bailey.

Momma used the juice to make almost-black fruit cakes. Then she lined heavy soot-encrusted iron skillets with the pineapple rings for rich upside-down cakes. Bailey and I received one slice each, and I carried mine around for hours, shredding off the fruit until nothing was left except the perfume on my fingers.

It seemed that the peace of a day's ending was an assurance that the covenant God made with children, Negroes and the crippled was still in effect.

How great it would be to grow up like that, to be able to stare religion down, especially living next door to a woman like Momma.

When I was described by our playmates as being shit color, he was lauded for his velvet-black skin.

When I was described by our playmates as being shit color, he was lauded for his velvet-black skin. His hair fell down in black curls, and my head was covered with black steel wool. And yet he loved me.

Bailey was the greatest person in my world. And the fact that he was my brother, my only brother, and I had no sisters to share him with, was such good fortune that it made me want to live a Christian life just to show God that I was grateful. Where I was big, elbowy and grating, he was small, graceful and smooth. When I was described by our playmates as being shit color, he was lauded for his velvet-black skin. His hair fell down in black curls, and my head was covered with black steel wool. And yet he loved me.

His hair fell down in black curls, and my head was covered with black steel wool. And yet he loved me. When our elders said unkind things about my features (my family was handsome to a point of pain for me), Bailey would wink at me from across the room, and I knew that it was a matter of time before he would take revenge. He would allow the old ladies to finish wondering how on earth I came about, then he would ask, in a voice like cooling bacon grease, “Oh Mizeriz Coleman, how is your son? I saw him the other day, and he looked sick enough to die.” Aghast, the ladies would ask, “Die? From what? He ain't sick.” And in a voice oilier than the one before, he'd answer with a straight face, “From the Uglies.”.

Top, spinning, falling, laughing, finally stopping just before my heart beat its last, and then he was back in the game, still laughing. Of.

Of all the needs (there are none imaginary) a lonely child has, the one that must be satisfied, if there is going to be hope and a hope of wholeness, is the unshaking need for an unshakable God. My pretty Black brother was my Kingdom Come.

People in Stamps used to say that the whites in our town were so prejudiced that a Negro couldn't buy vanilla ice cream. Except on July Fourth. Other days he had to be satisfied with chocolate.

Whatever was given by Black people to other Blacks was most probably needed as desperately by the donor as by the receiver. A fact which made the giving or receiving a rich exchange.

Of course, I knew God was white too, but no one could have made me believe he was prejudiced.

Her smile widened her mouth beyond her cheeks beyond her ears and seemingly through the walls to the street outside.

It would have been near impossible to maintain formality under a small town's invasions of privacy.

“Ritie, don't worry 'cause you ain't pretty. Plenty pretty women I seen digging ditches or worse. You smart. I swear to God, I rather you have a good mind than a cute behind.”.

When she chose to smile on me, I always wanted to thank her. The action was so graceful and inclusively benign.

She was one of the few gentlewomen I have ever known, and has remained throughout my life the measure of what a human being can be.

Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them.

Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with the shades of deeper meaning.”.

It went without saying that all girls could iron and wash, but the finer touches around the home, like setting a table with real silver, baking roasts and cooking vegetables without meat, had to be learned elsewhere.

Weekdays revolved on a sameness wheel. They turned into themselves so steadily and inevitably that each seemed to be the original of yesterday's rough draft.

Weekdays revolved on a sameness wheel. They turned into themselves so steadily and inevitably that each seemed to be the original of yesterday's rough draft. Saturdays, however, always broke the mold and dared to be different.

For he was all I claimed, if not all I had.

And—“How can you claim to be my brother, and hate me? Is that Charity? How can you claim to be my sister and despise me? Is that supposed to be Charity? How can you claim to be my friend and misuse and wrongfully abuse me? Is that Charity?.

“If you ask a Negro where he's been, he'll tell you where he's going.”.

“Anything that works against you can also work for you once you.

“Anything that works against you can also work for you once you understand the Principle of Reverse.

“Life is going to give you just what you put in it. Put your whole heart in everything you do, and pray, then you can wait.”.

“hoped for the best, was prepared for the worst, so anything in between didn't come as a surprise.”.


# Design of Everyday Things (Norman, Don)

Calling something a “Norman door” is recognition of the lack of attention paid by the maker to the user, which is precisely my message.

Most accidents are attributed to human error, but in almost all cases the human error was the direct result of poor design.

What could it possibly mean for knowledge to be in the world? Knowledge is interpreted, the stuff that can be only in minds. Information, yes, that could be in the world, but knowledge, never. Well, yeah, the distinction between knowledge and information is not clear. If we are sloppy with terms, then perhaps you can see the issues better.

Yes. I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that should be slid.


# Things My Son Needs to Know About the World (Fredrik Backman)

For all the times I forget to lock the bathroom door—what is seen can’t be unseen.

The REAL MEN WEIGH OVER 200 POUNDS T-shirt.

When those Swiss physicists appeared in the media a couple of years ago talking about their groundbreaking research and the discovery of a “previously unknown particle” that could travel faster than the speed of light, and the entire world was wondering what this new particle might consist of, all parents with small children looked at one another in unison and just said: “Poop. I bet anything it’s poop.”.

There are ten thousand eternities and a life-affirming French drama between each of them.

Because if our kids don’t grow up to be better than us, then what’s the point of all this? We want you to be kinder, smarter, more humble, more generous, and more selfless than we are. We want to give you the very best circumstances we can possibly provide.

The realization that you will, from that moment on, draw all your breaths through someone else’s lungs hits you harder when you aren’t prepared.


# Born a Crime (Trevor Noah)

For a long time I didn’t understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you’re Native American and you pray to the wolves, you’re a savage. If you’re African and you pray to your ancestors, you’re a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that’s just common sense.

Friday and Saturday we had off. (Time to sin!).

Noah and the flood was obviously a favorite; I had a personal stake there.

Almost everything that’s ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand.

Almost everything that’s ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car.

Almost everything that’s ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car. Secondhand cars made me get detention for being late for school. Secondhand cars left us hitchhiking on the side of the freeway. A secondhand car was also the reason my mom got married. If it hadn’t been for the Volkswagen that didn’t work, we never would have looked for the mechanic who became the husband who became the stepfather who became the man who tortured us for years and put a bullet in the back of my mother’s head—I’ll take the new car with the warranty every time. As.

In any society built on institutionalized racism, race-mixing doesn’t merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. Race-mixing proves that races can mix—and in a lot of cases, want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason.

That’s how a police state works—everyone thinks everyone else is the police.

Where most children are proof of their parents’ love, I was the proof of their criminality.

He told me his story, and I was like, “Wait, what? You mean we could have left? That was an option?” Imagine being thrown out of an airplane. You hit the ground and break all your bones, you go to the hospital and you heal and you move on and finally put the whole thing behind you—and then one day somebody tells you about parachutes.

In Soweto you were always hearing about men getting doused with pots of boiling water—often a woman’s only recourse. And men were lucky if it was water. Some women used hot cooking oil. Water was if the woman wanted to teach her man a lesson. Oil meant she wanted to end it.

The fact that I grew up in a world run by women was no accident. Apartheid kept me away from my father because he was white, but for almost all the kids I knew on my grandmother’s block in Soweto, apartheid had taken away their fathers as well, just for different reasons. Their fathers were off working in a mine somewhere, able to come home only during the holidays. Their fathers had been sent to prison. Their fathers were in exile, fighting for the cause. Women held the community together. “Wathint’Abafazi Wathint’imbokodo!” was the chant they would rally to during the freedom struggle. “When you strike a woman, you strike a rock.” As a nation, we recognized the power of women, but in the home they were expected to submit and obey.

Tuesday nights, the prayer meeting came to my grandmother’s house, and I was always excited, for two reasons. One, I got to clap along on the beat for the singing. And two, I loved to pray. My grandmother always told me that she loved my prayers. She believed my prayers were more powerful, because I prayed in English. Everyone knows that Jesus, who’s white, speaks English. The Bible is in English. Yes, the Bible was not written in English, but the Bible came to South Africa in English so to us it’s in English. Which made my prayers the best prayers because English prayers get answered first. How do we know this? Look at white people. Clearly they’re getting through to the right person.

Women in the township always had something to pray for—money problems, a son who’d been arrested, a daughter who was sick, a husband who drank. Whenever the prayer meetings were at our house, because my prayers were so good, my grandmother would want me to pray for everyone. She would turn to me and say, “Trevor, pray.” And I’d pray. I loved doing it. My grandmother had convinced me that my prayers got answered. I felt like I was helping people.

Add to that Matthew 19:14. “Suffer little children to come unto me,” Jesus said, “for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” So if a child is praying in English? To White Jesus? That’s a powerful combination right there. Whenever I prayed, my grandmother would say, “That prayer is going to get answered. I can feel it.” Women in the township always had something to pray for—money problems, a son who’d been arrested, a daughter who was sick, a husband who drank. Whenever the prayer meetings were at our house, because my prayers were so good, my grandmother would want me to pray for everyone. She would turn to me and say, “Trevor, pray.” And I’d pray.

People built homes the way they bought eggs: a little at a time. Every family in the township was allocated a piece of land by the government. You’d first build a shanty on your plot, a makeshift structure of plywood and corrugated iron. Over time, you’d save up money and build a brick wall. One wall. Then you’d save up and build another wall. Then, years later, a third wall and eventually a fourth. Now you had a room, one room for everyone in your family to sleep, eat, do everything. Then you’d save up for a roof. Then windows. Then you’d plaster the thing. Then your daughter would start a family. There was nowhere for them to go, so they’d move in with you. You’d add another corrugated-iron structure onto your brick room and slowly, over years, turn that into a proper room for them as well. Now your house had two rooms. Then three. Maybe four. Slowly, over generations, you’d keep trying to get to the point where you had a home.

I never understood why my grandmother had a driveway. She didn’t have a car. She didn’t know how to drive. Yet she had a driveway. All of our neighbors had driveways, some with fancy, cast-iron gates. None of them had cars, either. There was no future in which most of these families would ever have cars. There was maybe one car for every thousand people, yet almost everyone had a driveway. It was almost like building the driveway was a way of willing the car to happen. The story of Soweto is the story of the driveways. It’s a hopeful place.

We couldn’t afford toilet paper, so on the wall next to the seat was a wire hanger with old newspaper on it for you to wipe. The newspaper was uncomfortable, but at least I stayed informed while I handled my business.

One afternoon, when I was around five years old, my gran left me at home for a few hours to go run errands. I was lying on the floor in the bedroom, reading. I needed to go, but it was pouring down rain. I was dreading going outside to use the toilet, getting drenched running out there, water dripping on me from the leaky ceiling, wet newspaper, the flies attacking me from below. Then I had an idea. Why bother with the outhouse at all? Why not put some newspaper on the floor and do my business like a puppy? That seemed like a fantastic idea. So that’s what I did. I took the newspaper, laid it out on the kitchen floor, pulled down my pants, and squatted and got to it. When you shit, as you first sit down, you’re not fully in the experience yet. You are not yet a shitting person. You’re transitioning from a person about to shit to a person who is shitting. You don’t whip out your smartphone or a newspaper right away. It takes a minute to get the first shit out of the way and get in the zone and get comfortable. Once you reach that moment, that’s when it gets really nice. It’s a powerful experience, shitting. There’s something magical about it, profound even. I think God made humans shit in the way we do because it brings us back down to earth and gives us humility. I don’t care who you are, we all shit the same. Beyoncé shits. The pope shits. The Queen of England shits. When we shit we forget our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or how rich we are. All of that goes away. You are never more yourself than when you’re taking a shit. You have that moment where you realize, This is me. This is who I am. You can pee without giving it a second thought, but not so with shitting. Have you ever looked in a baby’s eyes when it’s shitting? It’s having a moment of pure self-awareness. The outhouse ruins that for you. The rain, the flies, you are robbed of your moment, and nobody should be robbed of that. Squatting and shitting on the kitchen floor that day, I was like, Wow. There are no flies. There’s no stress. This is really great. I’m really enjoying this. I knew I’d made an excellent choice, and I was very proud of myself for making it. I’d reached that moment where I could relax and be with myself. Then I casually looked around the room and I glanced to my left and there, just a few feet away, right next to the coal stove, was Koko.

People are getting hurt, and just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

But the real world doesn’t go away. Racism exists. People are getting hurt, and just because it’s not happening to you doesn’t mean it’s not happening. And at some point, you have to choose. Black or white. Pick a side. You can try to hide from it. You can say, “Oh, I don’t pick sides,” but at some point life will force you to pick a side.

Lady, clearly you do not know what kind of stories to be telling a ten-year-old.

“Learn from your past and be better because of your past,” she would say, “but don’t cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don’t hold on to it. Don’t be bitter.”.

Give me Roald Dahl. James and the Giant Peach, The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. That was my fix.

My mom did what school didn’t. She taught me how to think.

“My job is to feed your body, feed your spirit, and feed your mind.”.

We tell people to follow their dreams, but you can only dream of what you can imagine, and, depending on where you come from, your imagination can be quite limited.

One day I was getting a hiding and I thought, Man, if only my mom hit me like this, and I started laughing.

She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned.

She taught me to challenge authority and question the system. The only way it backfired on her was that I constantly challenged and questioned her.

Things catch fire sometimes. That’s why there’s a fire brigade.

But I was blessed with another trait I inherited from my mother: her ability to forget the pain in life. I remember the thing that caused the trauma, but I don’t hold on to the trauma. I never let the memory of something painful prevent me from trying something new. If you think too much about the ass-kicking your mom gave you, or the ass-kicking that life gave you, you’ll stop pushing the boundaries and breaking the rules. It’s better to take it, spend some time crying, then wake up the next day and move on. You’ll have a few bruises and they’ll remind you of what happened and that’s okay. But after a while the bruises fade, and they fade for a reason—because now it’s time to get up to some shit again.

I knew his absence was because of circumstance and not a lack of love.

I walked out of his house that day an inch taller. Seeing him had reaffirmed his choosing of me. He chose to have me in his life. He chose to answer my letter. I was wanted. Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being.

That’s where the government came up with things like the pencil test. If you were applying to be white, the pencil went into your hair. If it fell out, you were white. If it stayed in, you were colored.

Don’t regret anything I’ve ever done in life, any choice that I’ve made. But I’m consumed with regret for the things I didn’t do, the choices I didn’t make, the things I didn’t say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. “What if…” “If only…” “I wonder what would have…” You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days.

The only girls in my life were the naked ones on my computer.

Cool guys get girls, and funny guys get to hang out with the cool guys with their girls.

I knew it was against the dealer’s code: Never get high on your own supply.

People don’t want to be rich. They want to be able to choose. The richer you are, the more choices you have. That is the freedom of money.

Bongani was one of those people who brought out the best in everybody. He was that friend who believed in you and saw the potential in you that nobody else did, which was why so many of the township kids gravitated toward him, and why I gravitated toward him as well. Bongani was always popular, but his reputation really took off when he beat up one of the more infamous bullies in the school.

The hood made me realize that crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime cares. Crime is grassroots. Crime looks for the young kids who need support and a lifting hand. Crime offers internship programs and summer jobs and opportunities for advancement. Crime gets involved in the community. Crime doesn’t discriminate.

Hustling is to work what surfing the Internet is to reading.

Hustling is to work what surfing the Internet is to reading. If you add up how much you read in a year on the Internet—tweets, Facebook posts, lists—you’ve read the equivalent of a shit ton of books, but in fact you’ve read no books in a year. When I look back on it, that’s what hustling was. It’s maximal effort put into minimal gain. It’s a hamster wheel. If I’d put all that energy into studying I’d have earned an MBA. Instead I was majoring in hustling, something no university would give me a degree for.

The hood was strangely comforting, but comfort can be dangerous. Comfort provides a floor but also a ceiling.

And I’ll never forget thinking to myself that it felt like he did it on purpose. He sabotaged himself so that he’d get accepted back into the group again.

In society, we do horrible things to one another because we don’t see the person it affects. We don’t see their face. We don’t see them as people. Which was the whole reason the hood was built in the first place, to keep the victims of apartheid out of sight and out of mind. Because if white people ever saw black people as human, they would see that slavery is unconscionable. We live in a world where we don’t see the ramifications of what we do to others, because we don’t live with them. It would be a whole lot harder for an investment banker to rip off people with subprime mortgages if he actually had to live with the people he was ripping off. If we could see one another’s pain and empathize with one another, it would never be worth it to us to commit the crimes in the first place.

There was one point when I remember eating a meal and saying to myself, This isn’t so bad. I hang around with a bunch of dudes. There’s no chores. No bills to pay. No one constantly nagging me and telling me what to do. Peanut butter sandwiches? Shit, I eat peanut butter sandwiches all the time. This is pretty sweet. I could do this.

No one constantly nagging me and telling me what to do. Peanut butter sandwiches? Shit, I eat peanut butter sandwiches all the time. This is pretty sweet. I could do this. I was so afraid of the ass-whooping waiting for me at home that I genuinely considered going to prison. For a brief moment I thought I had a plan. “I’ll go away for a couple of years, come back, and say I was kidnapped, and mom will never know and she’ll just be happy to see me.” —.

“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”.

“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else’s language, even if it’s just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, “I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being.”.

But I still had to pick. Because racism exists, and you have to pick a side. You can say that you don’t pick sides, but eventually life will force you to pick a side.

“I know you see me as some crazy old bitch nagging at you,” she said, “but you forget the reason I ride you so hard and give you so much shit is because I love you. Everything I have ever done I’ve done from a place of love. If I don’t punish you, the world will punish you even worse. The world doesn’t love you. If the police get you, the police don’t love you. When I beat you, I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.”.

“Why don’t I take medicine,” I said, “and then pray to Jesus to thank him for giving us the doctors who invented medicine, because medicine is what makes you feel better, not Jesus.”.

“Now who’s the best-looking person in the family, eh? I hope you enjoyed your week of being the pretty one, ’cause the queen is back, baby. You spent four hours at the salon to look like that. I just took a shower.”.

Because if you think someone is a monster and the whole world says he’s a saint, you begin to think that you’re the bad person.

“He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”.

I didn’t understand what she was going through. I didn’t understand domestic violence. I didn’t understand how adult relationships worked; I’d never even had a girlfriend. I didn’t understand how she could have sex with a man she hated and feared. I didn’t know how easily sex and hatred and fear can intertwine.

“You cannot blame anyone else for what you do. You cannot blame your past for who you are. You are responsible for you. You make your own choices.”.

If there’s a fan club for Jesus, my mom is definitely in the top 100, and this is what she gets?.

“What? What are you talking about, ‘the bright side’? Mom, you were shot in the face. There is no bright side.” “Of course there is. Now you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.”.

After an hour or so of waiting, she opened her unbandaged eye. The second she did, I lost it. I started bawling. She asked for some water and I gave her a cup, and she leaned forward a bit to sip through the straw. I kept bawling and bawling and bawling. I couldn’t control myself. “Shh,” she said. “Don’t cry, baby. Shhhhh. Don’t cry.” “How can I not cry, Mom? You almost died.” “No, I wasn’t going to die. I wasn’t going to die. It’s okay. I wasn’t going to die.” “But I thought you were dead.” I kept bawling and bawling. “I thought I’d lost you.” “No, baby. Baby, don’t cry. Trevor. Trevor, listen. Listen to me. Listen.” “What?” I said, tears streaming down my face. “My child, you must look on the bright side.” “What? What are you talking about, ‘the bright side’? Mom, you were shot in the face. There is no bright side.” “Of course there is. Now you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.”.

Through my tears, I started laughing, too. I was bawling my eyes out and laughing hysterically at the same time. We sat there and she squeezed my hand and we cracked each other up the way we always did, mother and son, laughing together through the pain in an intensive-care recovery room on a bright and sunny and beautiful day.

# Bad Blood (John Carreyrou)

Asia had been ravaged earlier in 2003 by the spread of a previously unknown illness called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Elizabeth had spent the summer testing patient specimens obtained with old low-tech methods like syringes and nasal swabs.

He’d made more money than he knew what to do with and wanted to enjoy more time with his wife and two kids.

He often joked that she could sell ice cream to Eskimos.

Believe in the people who disagree with you…Lying is a disgusting habit, and it flows through the conversations here like it’s our own currency. The cultural disease here is what we should be curing before we try to tackle obesity…I mean no ill will towards you, since you believe in what I was doing and hoped I would succeed at Theranos.

She had this intense way of looking at you while she spoke that made you believe in her and want to follow her.

“I have news for you, sir: in 1863, President Lincoln freed the slaves.”.

“Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.”.

Steve Jobs would have rolled over in his grave if he had seen one of them.

I was like a dog without a bone. I needed a new bone to chew on.

All, the story would require corroboration.

One approach she favored was to portray me as a misogynist. To generate further sympathy, she suggested she reveal publicly that she had been sexually assaulted as a student at Stanford.

One approach she favored was to portray me as a misogynist. To generate further sympathy, she suggested she reveal publicly that she had been sexually assaulted as a student at Stanford. Her advisers counseled against going that route, but she didn’t abandon it entirely. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, she suggested she was the victim of sexism.

Holmes would be hosting a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign at Theranos’s headquarters in Palo Alto.

If not for his courage and the more than $400,000 his parents had spent on his attorneys, I might never have been able to get my first article published, I realized. I felt pangs of guilt for having put him through such an ordeal.

Fortunately, Tyler didn’t seem too worried about it. “Next time maybe I’ll take a selfie with you and send it her way to save her the trouble of hiring PIs,” he quipped in an email.

Like her idol Steve Jobs, she emitted a reality distortion field that forced people to momentarily suspend disbelief.

She also agreed to be barred from being an officer or director in a public company for ten years.

THE TERM “VAPORWARE” was coined in the early 1980s to describe new computer software or hardware that was announced with great fanfare only to take years to materialize, if it did at all. It was a reflection of the computer industry’s tendency to play it fast and loose when it came to marketing. Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle were all accused of engaging in the practice at one point or another. Such overpromising became a defining feature of Silicon Valley. The harm done to consumers was minor, measured in frustration and deflated expectations.

# Find Your Why (Simon Sinek)

As you listen, you’ll take notes, identifying themes, ideas, words or phrases that recur in the stories; these themes will weave together into a golden thread to define who they are at their natural best.

Pride, love, fulfillment, fear, belonging, loneliness—all these and more might show up in different ways.

Often, the expression of feelings indicates an underlying and significant lesson or a particular relationship that embodies who they truly are today.

“If you’re different at work than you are at home, in one of those two places you’re lying.”.

We can’t always control the environment we’re in, but we can take responsibility for the way we show up. Your.

# Anxious People (Backman, Fredrik)

This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is. Especially if you have other people you’re trying to be a reasonably good human being for.

Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye.

‘If your head isn’t up to the job, your legs better be!’.

It should be noted that this particular bank robber had the same level of fitness as the average thirty-nine-year-old. Not one of those big-city thirty-nine-year-olds who deal with their midlife crisis by buying ridiculously expensive cycling shorts and swimming caps because they have a black hole in their soul that devours Instagram pictures, more the sort of thirty-nine-year-old whose daily consumption of cheese and carbohydrates was more likely to be classified medically as a cry for help rather than a diet.

Because everyone loves someone, and anyone who loves someone has had those desperate nights where we lie awake trying to figure out how we can afford to carry on being human beings. Sometimes that makes us do things that seem ridiculous in hindsight, but which felt like the only way out at the time.

It’s the day before New Year’s Eve in a not particularly large town.

Because you’ve probably been depressed yourself, you’ve had days when you’ve been in terrible pain in places that don’t show up in X-rays, when you can’t find the words to explain it even to the people who love you.

At the end of your career you’re trying to find a point to it all, and at the start of it you’re looking for a purpose.

One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon.

Older men rarely know what to say to younger men to let them know that they care.

Older men rarely know what to say to younger men to let them know that they care. It’s so hard to find the words when all you really want to say is: ‘I can see you’re hurting.’.

‘Do you know what the worst thing about being a parent is? That you’re always judged by your worst moments.

Then the man explained that he’d had a pretty good job, he’d set up his own relatively successful business, bought a fairly nice apartment. That he’d invested all his savings in shares in a property development company, so that his children could get even better jobs and even nicer apartments, so that they could have the freedom not to have to worry, not have to fall asleep exhausted every night with a pocket calculator in their hands. Because that was a parent’s job: to provide shoulders. Shoulders for your children to sit on when they’re little so they can see the world, then stand on when they get older so they can reach the clouds, and sometimes lean against whenever they stumble and feel unsure.

I’m one of those penguins that squats on top of a stone because I don’t want to accept that the egg has gone.

‘She said I’m overprotective. That I’m one of those penguins that squats on top of a stone because I don’t want to accept that the egg has gone. She said you can’t protect your kids from life, because life gets us all in the end.’.

The estate agent takes a deep breath and says what women usually say to men who never seem to think that their lack of knowledge should get in the way of a confident opinion. ‘I’m sure you’re right.’.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them. One generation got told off for not being able to sit still, the next gets told off for never moving.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them. One generation got told off for not being able to sit still, the next gets told off for never moving. So when Jim writes a report he hits every key all the way down very deliberately, then checks the screen at once to make sure it hasn’t tricked him, and only then does he press the next key. Because Jim isn’t the sort of man who lets himself be tricked. Jack, in turn, types the way young men who’ve never lived in a world without the Internet do, he can do it blindfolded, stroking the keys so gently that even a forensics expert wouldn’t be able to prove that he’d touched them.

When the son is looking for something on the Internet, he calls it ‘googling,’ but when his dad does the same thing he says: ‘I’ll look that up on Google.’ When they disagree about something, the father says: ‘Well, it must be right, because I read it on Google!’ and the son exclaims: ‘You don’t actually read things on Google, Dad, you search for them there …’.

Jim is slow, Jack efficient. Jim tells a story; Jack simply gives a report. Jim deletes and edits and starts again, Jack just types and types as if there were nothing on the planet that could be described in more than one way.

Jim is slow, Jack efficient. Jim tells a story; Jack simply gives a report. Jim deletes and edits and starts again, Jack just types and types as if there were nothing on the planet that could be described in more than one way. In his youth Jim had dreams of becoming a writer. In fact he was still dreaming about that until long into Jack’s childhood.

That’s an impossible thing for sons to grasp, and a source of shame for fathers to have to admit: that we don’t want our children to pursue their own dreams or walk in our footsteps. We want to walk in their footsteps while they pursue our dreams.

Jim used to think that children were like kites, so he held on to the string as tightly as he could, but eventually the wind carried her off anyway.

Drugs are a sort of dusk that grant us the illusion that we’re the ones who decide when the light goes out, but that power never belongs to us. The darkness takes us whenever it likes.

He presses his thumbs hard against his eyebrows, as if he hopes they’re two buttons and if he keeps them pressed at the same time for ten seconds he’ll be able to restore life to its factory settings.

Most adults have had a number of really bad moments, and of course not even fairly happy people manage to be happy the whole darn time.

One likes coffee, the other tea. One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon.

One likes coffee, the other tea. One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon. The older man thinks the most important thing is for a police officer to do the right thing, the younger thinks it’s more important to do things correctly.

‘There are days when I can’t help thinking you never really came back from that bridge, love. That you’re still trying to save that man on the railing, even though it’s as impossible now as it was back then.’.

Jim didn’t say a word when Jack sat down at his computer after his outburst. But when the coffee cup hit the wall, it wasn’t Jack who threw it. Because even if his son was furious about not being able to save the perpetrator’s life, and hated the fact that a group of damn Stockholmers were about to show up and take the investigation away from him, that came nowhere close to the frustration his father felt at not being able to help him.

It’s easier to talk about work when you haven’t quite got the words to talk about the other things in life, but obviously those words apply to both things at the same time.

Too much time has passed for the father to ask his son how he’s doing, too much time for the son to be able to explain.

He comes back with two more cups. Not that Jack drinks coffee, but he understands that it occasionally means something to his father not to have to drink alone.

We lie to those we love.

It’s hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it’s full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, alcohol-free beer.

She hoped they were, because sometimes it’s easier to live with your own anxieties if you know that no one else is happy, either.

Tall people have feelings, too, you know.

‘Nothing’s entirely risk-free, you should have known what you were getting into, you shouldn’t have given us your money.’.

‘when one party in an agreement is protected against the negative consequences of its own actions.’.

‘life can go all sorts of different ways, but it will probably go wrong.’.

But how many people do you have to save in order to be allowed to kill someone?.

Let’s take a much simpler example, then: Are you allowed to steal? No, you mustn’t steal. We agree on that. Except when you steal someone’s heart, because that’s romantic. Or if you steal harmonicas from guys who play the harmonica at parties, because that’s being public spirited. Or if you steal something small because you really have to. That’s probably okay. But does that mean it’s okay to steal something a bit bigger? And who decides how much bigger? If you really have to steal, how much do you have to have to do it in order for it to be reasonable to steal something really serious? For instance, if you feel that you really have to and that no one will get hurt: Is it okay to rob a bank then?.

It's funny how the most afraid people on the planet are the ones with small children. Some people are afraid of their own life, but most peope are afraid for the lives that depend on them.

Except fear,.

Possibly because the bank robber had small children and had therefore had a lot of practice being afraid.

So every so often they do tiny, tiny things at the most peculiar times, to buoy us up a little. Just enough to stop us from drowning.

It’s possible that some children realize this. So every so often they do tiny, tiny things at the most peculiar times, to buoy us up a little. Just enough to stop us from drowning.

Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super-smart and really funny and immortal.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super-smart and really funny and immortal. Perhaps there’s a biological reason for that, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and hopelessly for one single reason: you’re theirs. Which is a pretty smart move on biology’s part, you have to give it that.

We give those we love nicknames, because love requires a word that belongs to us alone.

The bank robber parent never uses the girls’ real names. That’s the sort of thing you never really notice until you belong to someone else, the fact that those of us who give children their names are the least willing to use them.

You probably have someone in your life whom you’d do something stupid for.

One frog. One monkey. And an elk that would do anything for them.

So the bank robber parent always calls the girls what they used to feel like, kicking in their mother’s belly six and eight years ago. One of them always seemed to be jumping about in there, and the other always seemed to be climbing. One frog. One monkey. And an elk that would do anything for them. Even when it’s completely stupid. Perhaps you have that in common after all. You probably have someone in your life whom you’d do something stupid for.

It’s possible for someone to be unfaithful to you without really thinking about you at all, but an affair requires planning. Perhaps that’s what hurts most of all, the millions of tiny clues that you didn’t notice. Maybe you’d have been even more crushed if there wasn’t even a good explanation. For instance, maybe you could have understood if it was about loneliness or desire, ‘You’re always at work and we never have any time for each other.’ But if the explanation is ‘Well, er, if you want me to be really honest, the person I’ve been unfaithful with is your boss,’ then it can be harder to get back up again. Because that means that the reason you’ve been working so much overtime is also the same reason why you no longer have a marriage.

When you get to work on the Monday after the break-up, your boss says: ‘Well, er, obviously it’s going to be uncomfortable for everyone involved, so … perhaps it would be easiest if you no longer worked here.’.

Once the frog said she’d heard an adult on the bus say ‘love hurts’, and the monkey replied that maybe that’s why hearts end up jagged when you try to draw them. How.

Once the frog said she’d heard an adult on the bus say ‘love hurts’, and the monkey replied that maybe that’s why hearts end up jagged when you try to draw them.

The truth, of course, is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn’t spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who’s having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit.

‘masked and fairly small. Not really small, but normally small! Maybe more normal than small! But what’s normal?’.

Being a Stockholmer was more a state of mind than a description of geographic origin.

‘Not all idiots are Stockholmers, but all Stockholmers are idiots,’ as.

Being a Stockholmer was more a state of mind than a description of geographic origin. ‘Not all idiots are Stockholmers, but all Stockholmers are idiots,’ as people often said at the police station. Which was obviously extremely unfair. Because it’s possible to stop being an idiot, but you can’t stop being a Stockholmer.

‘What do you want me to do?’ Jim asked, because he needed to be needed.

Turned out that one of them couldn’t live with the fact that the other one had such ugly shoes, and the other was turned off by the fact that the first dribbled when he brushed his teeth, and that both of them would rather have a partner who wasn’t quite so short.

If you’re constantly presented with alternatives, you can never make up your mind, Jim thought. How could anyone live with the stress of knowing that while their partner was in the bathroom, they could be swiping right or left and finding their soulmate.

If you’re constantly presented with alternatives, you can never make up your mind, Jim thought. How could anyone live with the stress of knowing that while their partner was in the bathroom, they could be swiping right or left and finding their soulmate? A whole generation would end up getting urinary tract infections because they had to keep waiting to pee until the charge on their partner’s phone ran out.

Is that phrase too hard to understand?.

You’re about as sharp as a wet box of cornflakes, aren’t you?.

‘Sometimes it’s hard to know who the biggest crooks are, people who rob banks, or the people who run the banks.’.

‘You need psychology if you think you’re a dolphin. You need psychiatry if you’ve killed all the dolphins.’.

‘I’d say that a panic attack is when psychological pain becomes so strong that it manifests itself physically. The anxiety becomes so acute that the brain can’t … well, in the absence of any better words, I’d say that the brain doesn’t have sufficient bandwidth to process all the information. The firewall collapses, so to speak. And anxiety overwhelms us.’.

Your generation don’t want to study a subject, you just want to study yourselves.’.

‘democracy as a system is doomed, because idiots will believe anything as long as the story’s good enough.’.

‘I don’t know what happiness is for her.’.

‘I didn’t say that money was happiness. I said happiness is like money. A made-up value that represents something we can’t weigh or measure.’.

‘That’s because people like you always look at people who are wealthier than you are and say: “Yes, they may be richer, but are they happy?” As if that was the meaning of life for anyone but a complete idiot, just going around being happy all the time.’.

‘Having a purpose. A goal. A direction. And do you want to know the truth? The truth is that far more people would rather be rich than happy.’.

That’s a relief, because what you think really matters to me. Can I go now?.

One: Are the actions of the person in question intended to harm you personally? Two: Do you possess all the information about the situation? Three: Do you have anything to gain from a conflict?’.

‘Why would I need help to stop getting into conflicts? Conflicts are good. Only weak people believe in harmony, and as a reward they get to float through life with a feeling of moral superiority while the rest of us get on with other things.’.

‘I buy distance from other people.’.

The most expensive thing you can buy in the most densely populated places on the planet is distance.’.

Do you think there are bad people?’.

We’re just strangers passing each other, your anxieties briefly brushing against mine as the fibres of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded pavement somewhere.

We’re just strangers passing each other, your anxieties briefly brushing against mine as the fibres of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded pavement somewhere. We never really know what we do to each other, with each other, for each other.

You can get it into your head to do some unbelievably stupid things when you run out of tears, when you can’t silence the voices no one else can hear, when you’ve never been in a room where you felt normal.

Because nothing unites a group of strangers more effectively than the opportunity to come together and sigh at a hopeless case.

People don’t want to buy a picture, they want to buy a frame.

You can always tell by the way people who love each other argue: the longer they’ve been together, the fewer words they need to start a fight.

They were always stressing about something, but without having anything they truly needed to hurry for.

At this Roger stopped kicking the skirting board, turned towards his wife, and looked her deep in the eye. Then he said four little words that he never said to any other woman on the planet. He said: ‘For God’s sake, darling.’.

When you’ve been stuck with each other long enough it can seem like there’s no difference between no longer arguing and no longer caring.

That’s the only thing someone who definitely wants to live and someone who definitely wants to die have in common: if you’re going to jump off something, you need to be pretty damn sure of the height.

Every third month Ro would become obsessed with something, 1950s dresses or bouillabaisse or antique coffee services or CrossFit or bonsai trees or a podcast about the Second World War, then she would spend three months studying the subject in question with unstinting devotion on Internet forums populated by people who clearly shouldn’t be allowed Wi-Fi in whatever padded cell they were locked up in, and then she would suddenly get fed up and immediately find a new obsession.

When you’ve been together for a very long time, it’s the little things that matter. In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say ‘I love you’, either.

When you’ve been together for a very long time, it’s the little things that matter. In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say ‘I love you’, either. Once when they were at IKEA, very recently, Roger had suggested when they were having lunch in the cafeteria that they each have a piece of cake. Because he understood that it was an important day for Anna-Lena, and because it was important to her, it was important to him as well. Because that’s how he loves her.

Can you imagine what a bad parent you must have been for your children not to want to be parents?.

That was the evening she went from being hopelessly infatuated to irrevocably in love.

They have a definition for what counts as personal, Julia and Ro, even though Julia is the only one who knows what that definition is.

‘Really? Tell me about all the Nobel Prize winners who grew up in Amish communities.’.

Anna-Lena had become interested in interior design late in life, but she had read in a book that every designer needed an ‘anchor’ in each new scheme. Something solid and definite that everything else can build upon, spreading out from it in ever-increasing circles. For Anna-Lena, that anchor was her bathroom cabinet. Roger understood that, because he appreciated the value of immovable objects, such as load-bearing walls. You can’t make them adapt to you, you simply have to adapt to them. So Roger always unscrewed the bathroom cabinet last of all whenever they moved out of an apartment, and installed it first when they arrived at the new one. That was how he loved her.

A man wants to be looked in the eye and told the truth when he’s no longer needed. But they faked it.

‘Thanks for that, you’re a real tonic. You’re like a self-help book, only in reverse.’.

I’m so positive that it makes people depressed.

“Now you’ll have to learn to cry in the cupboard, Jules, because children get frightened if you cry in front of them.”’.

Because on the news that morning there was a man, a politician, who said we ought to stop helping immigrants. That they just come here thinking they can get everything for free, and that a society can’t work like that.

‘We argue a lot about politics, Roger and I, we have very different opinions, but you can always … I think you can understand someone without necessarily agreeing with them, if you see what I mean? And I know people sometimes think Roger’s a bit of an idiot, but he isn’t always an idiot in the way people assume.’.

‘Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.’.

‘Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.’ Her son loved her, but she never managed to get him to believe in God, because although you might be able to drum religion into people, you can’t teach faith. But that night, all alone at the end of a dimly lit corridor in a hospital where she had held so many dying people by the hand, Jack sank to his knees and asked God not to take his mum away from him.

Addicts are addicted to their drugs, and their families are addicted to hope.

Drowning.’ Jack couldn’t help his sister.

‘We can’t change the world, and a lot of the time we can’t even change people. No more than one bit at a time. So we do what we can to help whenever we get the chance, sweetheart. We save those we can. We do our best. Then we try to find a way to convince ourselves that that will just have to … be enough. So we can live with our failures without drowning.’ Jack couldn’t help his sister.

She just walked right out into the street in front of us!’.

‘I don’t think we agree about everything, but I have a feeling He knows I’m doing the best I can. And I think maybe He knows I work for Him, because I try to help people.’.

‘Boats that stay in the harbour are safe, sweetheart, but that’s not what boats were built for.’.

‘God doesn’t protect people from knives, sweetheart. That’s why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.’.

The psychologist coughed, the way you do if your throat takes offence at you being predictable.

‘Because I can see that you don’t want to let people get close to you. It makes you feel weak. But I don’t think you’re afraid of being hurt, I think you’re afraid of hurting other people. You’re a more empathetic and moral person than you like to admit.’.

‘But do we really need penguins?’.

I’m not saying you’ve got a fork, but if you had a knife?’.

So not even really rich people ever feel really rich, because in the end the only thing you can buy is a more expensive version of something you’ve already got. With borrowed money.’.

‘I heard a man who worked in a casino say that no one gets ruined by losing, they get ruined by trying to win back the money they lost. Is that what you mean? Is that why the stock market and housing market crash?’.

‘So do you feel more guilty about the customers you haven’t lent money to, or the ones you’ve lent too much to?’.

Do you know how many men like you every single woman on the planet meets every day, who think that every thought that pops into your tiny little male brains is a lovely present you can give us?’.

More people should do that, ask if you’re hungry instead of how you’re feeling.

‘You have to listen to each other all the time. But not all the time. If you listen to each other all the time, there’s a risk that you can’t forgive each other afterwards.’.

‘When we first fell in love, Knut and I reached an agreement about how we were allowed to argue, because Knut said that sooner or later the first flush of infatuation wears off and you end up arguing whether you like it or not. So we came to an agreement, like the Geneva Convention, where the rules of war were agreed. Knut and I promised that no matter how angry we got, we weren’t allowed to consciously say things just to hurt each other. We weren’t allowed to argue just for the sake of winning. Because, sooner or later, that would end up with one of us winning. And no marriage can survive that.’ ‘Did it work?’ Julia asked. ‘I don’t know,’ Estelle admitted. ‘No?’ ‘We never got past the first flush of infatuation.’ There was no point even trying not to like her just then.

‘When we first fell in love, Knut and I reached an agreement about how we were allowed to argue, because Knut said that sooner or later the first flush of infatuation wears off and you end up arguing whether you like it or not. So we came to an agreement, like the Geneva Convention, where the rules of war were agreed.

‘Alcoholics don’t have unopened bottles of wine in the house. They have empty wine bottles.’.

He says you end up marrying the one you don’t understand. Then you spend the rest of your life trying.

‘you have to live your life in such a way that you become friends with death’,.

‘To die will be an awfully big adventure.’.

People’s dreams are always at their grandest when they’re looking for somewhere to live.

If you can do something for someone in such a way that they think they managed it all on their own, then you’ve done a good job.’.

“You can’t live long with the ones who are only beautiful, Jules. But the funny ones, oh, they last a lifetime!”’.

She’s my everyday. The whole … world.’.

‘Your mum was right, the ones who make you laugh last a lifetime,’.

Then she thought about an American author who had written that loneliness is like starvation, you don’t realize how hungry you are until you begin to eat.

‘You don’t have to like all children. Just one. And children don’t need the world’s best parents, just their own parents. To be perfectly honest with you, what they need most of the time is a chauffeur.’.

‘Are you going to do all you can, Julia? Are you going to protect the child with your life? Are you going to sing to it and read it stories and promise that everything will feel better tomorrow?’.

‘Are you going to raise it so that it doesn’t grow up to be one of those idiots who don’t take their backpack off when they’re on public transport.

Estelle was thinking about another author now, one who almost a hundred years ago wrote that your children aren’t your children, they’re the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself.

He used to say authors were like musicians who never get to the point.

He read such wonderful things. I don’t have the words to describe it, but it was like going on a journey with someone. Where didn’t matter.

‘Because you dance with the person you went to the party with. And I went with Knut.’.

It’s such an odd thing, the way you can know someone so perfectly through what they read.

Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and she was no longer making any attempt to stop them.

‘Obviously I can’t set a good example to my daughters and teach them not to do idiotic things now. But I might at least be able to show them how you take responsibility for your actions.’.

So Jim concluded there and then that the only way she wouldn’t get punished was not to catch her.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree. Because then I thought that sooner or later … and this sounds so pretentious … but I thought that sooner or later we’d end up on the same branch.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree. Because then I thought that sooner or later … and this sounds so pretentious … but I thought that sooner or later we’d end up on the same branch. And then we could sit there holding hands and looking at the view. That’s what I thought we’d be doing when we got old. But time goes quicker than you think.

‘My mum always says I should never apologize for myself. Never say sorry for being good at something.’.

We are asleep until we fall in love.

‘Send me a text when you’re safe, otherwise I’ll worry.’.

‘You’re not always such a damn good police officer, Dad.’ Jack will grin up at the clouds. He’ll want to add but I’ve learned everything else from you, but the words won’t quite come out.

‘There’s something romantic about the thought of all the apartments that aren’t for sale.’.

Nothing must happen to you No, what am I saying Everything must happen to you And it must be wonderful.

Anna-Lena stretches out her fingers towards his. She wants to say sorry. So does he. It’s a harder word than you might think, when you’ve been climbing trees for so long.

Then, eventually, a night will come which will be Estelle’s last night without Knut, and everyone else’s last night with Estelle.

Somewhere, in some sort of heaven, Estelle will be listening to music with one man and talking about literature with another. She’s earned that.

He never used to talk to her like that, but late in life even computer programmers become poets.

Dads are dads and daughters are daughters, and not even psychologists can quite come to terms with that.

Most people aren’t greedy, most people are just … like you said when we were talking about the picture: they’re just looking for something to cling on to.

‘Not knowing is a good place to start.’.

Sometimes we don’t need distance, just barriers.

Men and women going around for months having trouble breathing and seeing doctor after doctor because they think there’s something wrong with their lungs.

Men and women going around for months having trouble breathing and seeing doctor after doctor because they think there’s something wrong with their lungs. All because it’s so damn difficult to admit that something else is … broken. That it’s an ache in our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us, telling us we’re going to die. But there’s nothing wrong with our lungs, Zara. We’re not going to die, you and I.’ The.

Our brains are lying to us, telling us we’re going to die. But there’s nothing wrong with our lungs, Zara. We’re not going to die, you and I.’.

They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.

Because it’s the duty of children not to pay the slightest bit of attention to their parents.

How terrible must your real life feel to require this much … escape? All the creatures were happy, they lived in peace, and there was no pain in their little world.

Because perhaps it’s true what they say, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and uncontrollably for one simple reason: you’re theirs. Your parents and siblings can love you for the rest of your life, too, for precisely the same reason.

The truth. There isn’t any. All we’ve managed to find out about the boundaries of the universe is that it hasn’t got any, and all we know about God is that we don’t know anything.

We’re not in control. So we learn to pretend, all the time, about our jobs and our marriages and our children and everything else.

We pretend we’re normal, that we’re reasonably well educated, that we understand ‘amortization levels’ and ‘inflation rates’. That we know how sex works. In truth, we know as much about sex as we do about USB leads, and it always takes us four tries to get those little buggers in. (Wrong way round, wrong way round, wrong way round, there! In!).

Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn’t feel like it’s ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don’t know how, because it’s so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.

# Going Solo (Dahl, Roald)

A life is made up of a great number of small incidents and a small number of great ones.

An evening drink, for example, was always a sundowner. A drink at any other time was a chota peg.

To have a look at something was to have a shufti.

To have a look at something was to have a shufti. And from that one, interestingly enough, RAF/Middle East slang for a reconnaissance plane in the last war was a shufti kite.

Known Baroness Blixen very well. I myself had read and loved both Out of Africa and Seven Gothic Tales, and I listened enthralled to everything Miss Trefusis told me about that fine writer who called herself Isak Dinesen.

She was eating an orange at the time and I noticed suddenly that she was not eating it in the normal way. In the first place she had speared it from the fruit bowl with her fork instead of taking it in her fingers. And now, with knife and fork, she was making a series of neat incisions in the skin all around the orange. Then, very delicately, using the points of her knife and fork, she peeled the skin away in eight separate pieces, leaving the bare fruit beautifully exposed. Still using knife and fork, she separated the juicy segments and began to eat them slowly, one by one, with her fork.

‘Fingers are foul and filthy, but toes! Toes are reptilian and viperish!.

Dressing? Oh yes, indeed. We all dressed for dinner every single evening on board that ship. The male species of the Empire-builder, whether he is camping in the jungle or is at sea in a rowing-boat, always dresses for dinner, and by that I mean white shirt, black tie, dinner-jacket, black trousers and black patent-leather shoes, the full regalia, and to hell with the climate.

Not a great deal of intelligence or imagination was required, but by gum you needed to be fit and tough.

Simba is Swahili for lion.

The Germans have a leader called Bwana.

‘They say quite soon,’ I told him, ‘because over in Europe, which is ten times as far away as from here to Kilimanjaro, the Germans have a leader called Bwana Hitler who wishes to conquer the world. The Germans think this Bwana Hitler is a wonderful fellow. But he is actually a raving mad maniac. As soon as the war begins, the Germani will try to kill us all, and then, of course, we shall have to try to kill them before they can kill us.’.

There I was given a medical examination by an affable English doctor who remarked that six feet six inches was not the ideal height for a flier of aeroplanes.

It is a fact, and I verified it carefully later, that out of those sixteen, no fewer than thirteen were killed in the air within the next two years.

It seemed to me that I had been permanently blinded, and as I lay there in my quiet black room where all sounds, however tiny, had suddenly become twice as loud, I had plenty of time to think about what total blindness would mean in the future. Curiously enough, it did not frighten me. It did not even depress me. In a world where war was all around me and where I had ridden in dangerous little aeroplanes that roared and zoomed and crashed and caught fire, blindness, not to mention life itself, was no longer too important.

Only way to conduct oneself in a situation where bombs rained down and bullets whizzed past, was to accept the dangers and all the consequences as calmly as possible. Fretting and sweating about it all was not going to help.

I was already beginning to realize that the only way to conduct oneself in a situation where bombs rained down and bullets whizzed past, was to accept the dangers and all the consequences as calmly as possible. Fretting and sweating about it all was not going to help.

There already. So is your Squadron-Leader.’.


# A Man Without a Country (Vonnegut, Kurt)

Humor is an almost physiological response to fear.

Freud said that humor is a response to frustration—one of several.

True enough, there are such things as laughless jokes, what Freud called gallows humor. There are real-life situations so hopeless that no relief is imaginable.

I consider anybody a twerp who hasn’t read Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville. There can never be a better book than that one on the strengths and vulnerabilities inherent in our form of government.

“Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,”.

Has love of money taken a stronger hold on the affections of men.

“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.”.

Do you realize that all great literature—Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, A Farewell to Arms, The Scarlet Letter, The Red Badge of Courage, The Iliad and The Odyssey, Crime and Punishment, The Bible, and “The Charge of the Light Brigade”—are all about what a bummer it is to be a human being? (Isn’t it such a relief to have somebody say that?).

Anybody got an atomic bomb? Who doesn’t have an atomic bomb nowadays?.

“religion is the opium of the people.”.

“religion is the opium of the people.” Marx said that back in 1844, when opium and opium derivatives were the only effective painkillers anyone could take.

“religion is the opium of the people.” Marx said that back in 1844, when opium and opium derivatives were the only effective painkillers anyone could take. Marx himself had taken them. He was grateful for the temporary relief they had given him. He was simply noticing, and surely not condemning, the fact that religion could also be comforting to those in economic or social distress. It was a casual truism, not a dictum.

Critics feel that a person cannot be a serious artist and also have had a technical education, which I had.

In Dresden, on February 13, 1945, about 135,000 people were killed by British firebombing in one night.

And I realize some of you may be having trouble deciding whether I am kidding or not. So from now on I will tell you when I’m kidding.

If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don’t have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I’m not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.

Now let me give you a marketing tip. The people who can afford to buy books and magazines and go to the movies don’t like to hear about people who are poor or sick, so start your story up here [indicates top of the G-I axis]. You will see this story over and over again. People love it and it is not copyrighted. The story is “Man in Hole,” but the story needn’t be about a man or a hole. It’s: Somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again [draws line A].

The last thing I ever wanted was to be alive when the three most powerful people on the whole planet would be named Bush, Dick and Colon.

Freud said he didn’t know what women wanted. I know what women want: a whole lot of people to talk to.

Freud said he didn’t know what women wanted. I know what women want: a whole lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about everything.

Freud said he didn’t know what women wanted. I know what women want: a whole lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about everything. What do men want? They want a lot of pals, and they wish people wouldn’t get so mad at them.

Why are so many people getting divorced today? It’s because most of us don’t have extended families anymore. It used to be that when a man and a woman got married, the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to.

Huckleberry Finn, incidentally, was the first novel ever to be typewritten.

How beautiful it is to get up and go out and do something. We are here on Earth to fart around. Don’t let anybody tell you any different.

“Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.”.

No matter how corrupt, greedy, and heartless our government, our corporations, our media, and our religious and charitable institutions may become, the music will still be wonderful.

THE ONLY PROOF HE NEEDED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WAS MUSIC.

That specific remedy for the worldwide epidemic of depression is a gift called the blues. All pop music today—jazz, swing, be-bop, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Stones, rock-and-roll, hip-hop, and on and on—is derived from the blues.

The wonderful writer Albert Murray, who is a jazz historian and a friend of mine among other things, told me that during the era of slavery in this country—an atrocity from which we can never fully recover—the suicide rate per capita among slave owners was much higher.

He says the blues can’t drive depression clear out of a house, but can drive it into the corners of any room where it’s being played. So please remember that.

The biggest truth to face now—what is probably making me unfunny now for the remainder of my life—is that I don’t think people give a damn whether the planet goes on or not. It seems to me as if everyone is living as members of Alcoholics Anonymous do, day by day. And a few more days will be enough. I know of very few people who are dreaming of a world for their grandchildren.

Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts us absolutely.

Trusting to escape scrutiny, by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood—that serpent’s eye, that charms to destroy—he plunged into war.

Speaking of plunging into war, do you know why I think George W. Bush is so pissed off at Arabs? They brought us algebra. Also the numbers we use, including a symbol for nothing, which Europeans had never had before. You think Arabs are dumb? Try doing long division with Roman numerals.

So as a humanist I am honoring my ancestors, which the Bible says is a good thing to do. We humanists try to behave as decently, as fairly, and as honorably as we can without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife.

Persuasive guessing has been at the core of leadership for so long, for all of human experience so far, that it is wholly unsurprising that most of the leaders of this planet, in spite of all the information that is suddenly ours, want the guessing to go on. It is now their turn to guess and guess and be listened to. Some of the loudest, most proudly ignorant guessing in the world is going on in Washington today. Our leaders are sick of all the solid information that has been dumped on humanity by research and scholarship and investigative reporting. They think that the whole country is sick of it, and they could be right. It isn’t the gold standard that they want to put us back on. They want something even more basic. They want to put us back on the snake-oil standard.

“Life is no way to treat an animal, not even a mouse.”.

“Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.”.

And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one.

Some people are born deaf, some are born blind or whatever, and this book is about congenitally defective human beings of a sort that is making this whole country and many other parts of the planet go completely haywire nowadays.

Some people are born deaf, some are born blind or whatever, and this book is about congenitally defective human beings of a sort that is making this whole country and many other parts of the planet go completely haywire nowadays. These were people born without consciences, and suddenly they are taking charge of everything.

While on the subject of burning books, I want to congratulate librarians, not famous for their physical strength, their powerful political connections or great wealth, who, all over this country, have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves, and destroyed records rather than have to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles. So the America I loved still exists, if not in the White House, the Supreme Court, the Senate, the House of Representatives, or the media. The America I loved still exists at the front desks of our public libraries.

By saints I meant people who behaved decently in a strikingly indecent society.

“Please tell me it will all be okay.” “Welcome to Earth, young man,” I said. “It’s hot in.

Joe, a young man from Pittsburg, came up to me with one request: “Please tell me it will all be okay.” “Welcome to Earth, young man,” I said. “It’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It’s round and wet and crowded. At the outside, Joe, you’ve got about a hundred years here. There’s only one rule that I know of: Goddamn it, Joe, you’ve got to be kind!”.

The other day I was asked to do the now common act of taking off my shoes at the airport security screening. As I deposited my shoes in the tray, a sense of utter absurdity washed over me. I have to take my shoes off and have them scanned by an X-ray machine because some guy tried to blow up an airliner with his sneakers. And I thought, I feel like I’m in a world not even Kurt Vonnegut could have imagined. So now that I find I can ask you such questions, tell me, could you have imagined it? (We’re in real trouble if someone figures out how to make explosive pants.).

“The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.”.

House and Senate, and the Supreme Court, and We,.

But as William Shakespeare told us long ago, “The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.”.

I told him that if he doubted that we are demons in Hell, he should read The Mysterious Stranger, which Mark Twain wrote in 1898, long before the First World War (1914-1918). In the title story he proves to his own grim satisfaction, and to mine as well, that Satan and not God created the planet earth and “the damned human race.” If you doubt that, read your morning paper. Never mind what paper. Never mind what date.

“Swedes have short dicks but long memories.”.

I’ve known funny writers who stopped being funny, who became serious persons and could no longer make jokes.

Humor is a way of holding off how awful life can be, to protect yourself.

Finally, you get just too tired, and the news is too awful, and humor doesn’t work anymore.

Finally, you get just too tired, and the news is too awful, and humor doesn’t work anymore. Somebody like Mark Twain thought life was quite awful but held the awfulness at bay with jokes and so forth, but finally he couldn’t do it anymore. His wife, his best friend, and two of his daughters had died. If you live long enough, a lot of people close to you are going to die.

It may be that I have become rather grumpy because I’ve seen so many things that have offended me that I cannot deal with in terms of laughter.

Can control my life or my writing. Every other writer I know feels he is steering himself, and I don’t have that feeling. I don’t have that sort of control. I’m simply becoming.

Every other writer I know feels he is steering himself, and I don’t have that feeling. I don’t have that sort of control. I’m simply becoming.

If a hundred years from now people are still laughing, I’d certainly be pleased.

So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in the summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.”.

And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, “If this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.”.

“God put him on Earth to show us what it’s like to be really rich.”.


# How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life (Adams, Scott)

# How Not to Be Wrong : The Power of Mathematical Thinking (9780698163843) (Ellenberg, Jordan)

“Mathematics is not just a sequence of computations to be carried out by rote until your patience or stamina runs out—although it might seem that way from what you’ve been taught in courses called mathematics. Those integrals are to mathematics as weight training and calisthenics are to soccer. If you want to play soccer—I mean, really play, at a competitive level—you’ve got to do a lot of boring, repetitive, apparently pointless drills. Do professional players ever use those drills? Well, you won’t see anybody on the field curling a weight or zigzagging between traffic cones. But you do see players using the strength, speed, insight, and flexibility they built up by doing those drills, week after tedious week. Learning those drills is part of learning soccer. “If you want to play soccer for a living, or even make the varsity team, you’re going to be spending lots of boring weekends on the practice field. There’s no other way. But now here’s the good news. If the drills are too much for you to take, you can still play for fun, with friends. You can enjoy the thrill of making a slick pass between defenders or scoring from distance just as much as a pro athlete does. You’ll be healthier and happier than you would be if you sat home watching the professionals on TV. “Mathematics is pretty much the same. You may not be aiming for a mathematically oriented career. That’s fine—most people aren’t. But you can still do math. You probably already are doing math, even if you don’t call it that. Math is woven into the way we reason. And math makes you better at things. Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X-ray specs that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of the world. Math is a science of not being wrong about things, its techniques and habits hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, sounder, and more meaningful way. All you need is a coach, or even just a book, to teach you the rules and some basic tactics. I will be your coach. I will show you how.”.

Mathematics is the study of things that come out a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be.

Why would anyone think, even for a second, that all curves are straight lines, when they’re obviously not?.

A basic rule of mathematical life: if the universe hands you a hard problem, try to solve an easier one instead, and hope the simple version is close enough to the original problem that the universe doesn’t object.

And when you know how to do something the right way, it’s hard—for some stubborn people, impossible—to make yourself explain it the wrong way.

Understanding whether the result makes sense—or deciding whether the method is the right one to use in the first place—requires a guiding human hand. When we teach mathematics we are supposed to be explaining how to be that guide. A math course that fails to do so is essentially training the student to be a very slow, buggy version of Microsoft Excel.

# If on a Winters Night a Traveller (Italo Calvino)

Of course, the ideal position for reading is something you can never find.

It's not that you expect anything in particular from this particular book. You're the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything. There are plenty, younger than you or less young, who live in the expectation of extraordinary experiences: from books, from people, from journeys, from events, from what tomorrow has in store. But not you. You know that the best you can expect is to avoid the worst.

Books Read Long Ago Which It's Now Time To Reread and the Books You've Always Pretended To Have Read And Now It's Time To Sit Down And Really Read Them.

(for the new you seek in the not new and for the not new you seek in the new).

In other words, it's better for you to restrain your impatience and wait to open the book at home.

Long novels written today are perhaps a contradiction: the dimension of time has been shattered, we cannot love or think except in fragments of time each of which goes off along its own trajectory and immediately disappears. We can rediscover the continuity of time only in the novels of that period when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded, a period that lasted no more than a hundred years.

The lights of the station and the sentences you are reading seem to have the job of dissolving more than of indicating the things that surface from a veil of darkness and fog.

In a group of people who simply work together, relationships are mostly transactional, based on a mutual desire to get things done.

# Bits, Bytes, and Barrels: The Digital Transformation of Oil and Gas (Geoffrey Cann;Rachael Goydan)

Cost-reduction efforts have now brought the industry to a level of profitability that exceeds the level when oil prices peaked in 2014.

Royal Dutch Shell’s reported 2018 first quarter results show the company making as much profit at $60 per barrel as it did when oil was $100 per barrel.

Goldman Sachs also reported in early 2017 that European oil companies generated the same amount of cash at $52 per barrel as they did at $109.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest which was built almost completely on its oil and gas exports, intends to divest from holdings in fossil fuel businesses.

A new refinery, Canada’s first in a generation, rises from the industrial land northeast of Edmonton and will incorporate 25,000 sensors, an order of magnitude more than its predecessors. Each sensor will generate a steady flow of measurement data every second. The future of digital plants has arrived in oil and gas.

GasNinjas is in the fuel retail business and can even outsource the fuel delivery truck.

What’s fascinating about many of these business models is how they tend to be asset-light and information-intense, placing more value on data than on infrastructure.

Take a look at Quick, Draw! by Google, which encourages people to doodle online while an artificial intelligence engine interprets the drawings and teaches itself to recognize real-world objects from the doodles.

In a meeting with me, the CIO of one of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies dismissed cloud computing as a rent-extracting monopoly to be avoided.

In a meeting with me, the CIO of one of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies dismissed cloud computing as a rent-extracting monopoly to be avoided. The industry has been wary of creating monopolistic dependencies in its business model. It likes to use multiple suppliers for any one service, prefers multiple pathways to market, and invests across multiple jurisdictions.

After all, the costs of construction are amortized over the life of the project, which may be forty years or longer—an extra dollar here and there doesn’t amount to much of a worry.

A large spend program (say, $10 billion for an LNG plant) could be amortized to the tune of $500 million per year, a pittance to a business that might generate $5 billion per year in cash flow.

For example, my former company prohibits collaboration tools that lack built-in encryption because of the sensitivity of company data.

On the one hand, if prices rise, I would rather have capital at the ready for growth. On the other hand, if prices stay flat or decline, I would rather work on getting operating costs permanently lowered.

There will be voices internally advocating a do-nothing stance to see either commodity prices turn around or clear winners and losers to emerge in the technology race. The default position for many oil and gas companies is to wait, let someone else take the lead, and aim to be a fast follower.

Oil and gas companies have squeezed their suppliers hard, but suppliers tell me that they have simply cut their prices while removing a bit of capacity from the market.

Only a handful of years ago, petroleum engineers were in such short supply that they could command some of the highest starting salaries straight out of college. Given what you know now, what would you suggest that a high school senior or university student consider when choosing courses to study or a career path? In a more digital world, for example, the kind of skills required in geology will change. Schools will need to incorporate more data science, more artificial intelligence, and more coding alongside studies of the Jurassic and the Devonian. These blended curricula will become the basis for success in the future.

The culture of oil and gas places strong emphasis on safety, reliability, operational excellence, and environmental sensitivity. Another term for this culture is risk averse.

A junior field engineer with an EPC firm was tasked with visiting a company’s gas assets and building up an inventory of what was installed. Rather than using the typical paper diagrams and clipboards, he purchased a tablet and downloaded a free app from iTunes that normally would be used to build a home inventory for insurance purposes. He replaced the list of home assets (such as stereo system and microwave oven) with gas assets (such as wellhead, flare, and separator). With a couple of junior colleagues, he then set out to build the inventory. The team photographed the assets, built the inventory, and completed their work in a fraction of the time. The data captured was so accurate and complete that there was no data-entry work for the home-office team. Meanwhile, he encountered heated resistance to his novel approach the entire time—tablets won’t work in the field, the junior engineers won’t complete the inventory properly, the free app won’t be robust enough, the data collected won’t be in a format acceptable to the document controllers, and on and on.

One vendor of artificial intelligence tools told me that the biggest hurdle they encounter is convincing a grizzly veteran who’s spent thirty years managing an asset that AI can better his performance at all, let alone by 10 percent or more.

The first change challenge to manage is the temptation to view digital innovation as the end, not the means to the end.

“People follow process using data enabled by technology.”.

New mandate made it illegal for a government department to ask its citizens for the same information twice.

The world’s most aggressive digital country by far is Estonia. A new mandate made it illegal for a government department to ask its citizens for the same information twice. The country had to agree on a national data architecture to achieve this goal. It attracts more virtual citizens than any other in Europe. Boards might wish to hold a meeting there and see about meetings with the country’s CIO to understand how it is transitioning to a digital future. Estonia’s insights will fundamentally challenge many Western orthodoxies about commerce, governance, accountability, and business models.

Business-model changes seemingly come from nowhere to catch industry incumbents off-guard. For example, Kodak had its eye on digital cameras, but the real threat came from camera phones. Paper maps have all but disappeared with the development of GPS. The Yellow Pages were not searching for search engines. The DVD industry was worried more about LaserDiscs than video streaming.

Recall that one company’s margin is another company’s meal:.

Some Australian offshore gas projects paid north of $200,000 per year for “laundry technicians.”.

The idea that only a human can take a seat, read the dials, handle the controls, and act is fast becoming an obsolete idea.

I began to piece the story together, like a quilter who takes fragments of leftover cloth and builds a tapestry (it looks good from a distance, but up close it’s pretty ugly).

Skeptics, and there are many, view digital at one end of a spectrum as a solution looking for a problem and, at the other end, as another play by technology companies to get rich at their customers’ expense.

I used to joke that a fifty-five-year-old with thirty years of experience actually had just one year of experience repeated thirty times.


# The Deal of a Lifetime (Fredrik Backman)

We discover we need someone to sweep us off our feet to realize what time really is.

Maybe all people have that feeling deep down, that your hometown is something you can never really escape, but can never really go home to, either.

Most of us so desperately want to believe that every heart which stops beating is missed equally.

# Maybe You Should Talk to Someone (Lori Gottlieb)

It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them.

During my training, a supervisor once told me, “There’s something likable in everyone,” and to my great surprise, I found that she was right. It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them. We should take the world’s enemies, get them in a room to share their histories and formative experiences, their fears and their struggles, and global adversaries would suddenly get along. I’ve found something likable in literally everyone I’ve seen as a therapist, including the guy who attempted murder.

What John doesn’t know is that I’m reeling.

As a therapist, I know a lot about pain, about the ways in which pain is tied to loss. But I also know something less commonly understood: that change and loss travel together. We can’t have change without loss, which is why so often people say they want change but nonetheless stay exactly the same.

I’m a card-carrying member of the human race.

Which is to say, if you see yourself in these pages, it’s both coincidental and intentional.

What I really need just hours into this breakup is for somebody to sit with me in my pain, but I also know how helpless it feels to watch a friend suffer and do nothing to fix it.

What I really need just hours into this breakup is for somebody to sit with me in my pain, but I also know how helpless it feels to watch a friend suffer and do nothing to fix it. Sitting-with-you-in-your-pain is one of the rare experiences that people get in the protected space of a therapy room, but it’s very hard to give or get outside of it—even for Jen, who is a therapist.

“You seem depressed,” she said with concern. I said I wasn’t depressed; I was just bored. I hadn’t considered that if the only thing that keeps you going all day is knowing you’ll get to turn on the TV after dinner, you probably are depressed.

What people don’t like to think about is that you can do everything right—in life or in a treatment protocol—and still get the short end of the stick.

What people don’t like to think about is that you can do everything right—in life or in a treatment protocol—and still get the short end of the stick. And when that happens, the only control you have is how you deal with that stick—your way, not the way others say you should.

Above all, I didn’t want to fall into the trap that Buddhists call idiot compassion—an apt phrase, given John’s worldview. In idiot compassion, you avoid rocking the boat to spare people’s feelings, even though the boat needs rocking and your compassion ends up being more harmful than your honesty.

The answer is this: Because therapists know that at first, each patient is simply a snapshot, a person captured in a particular moment.

Why would we choose a profession that requires us to meet unhappy, distressed, abrasive, or unaware people and sit with them, one after the other, alone in a room? The answer is this: Because therapists know that at first, each patient is simply a snapshot, a person captured in a particular moment. It’s like a photo of you taken from an unfortunate angle and with a sour expression on your face. There might also be a photo in which you’re glowing, caught opening a present or mid-laugh with a lover. Both are you in that fraction of time, and neither is you in your entirety.

After Julie learned that she was dying, her best friend, Dara, wanting to be helpful, sent her the well-known essay “Welcome to Holland.” Written by Emily Perl Kingsley, the parent of a child with Down syndrome, it’s about the experience of having your life’s expectations turned upside down:.

When you’re going to have a baby, it’s like planning a fabulous vacation trip—to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It’s all very exciting. After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The flight attendant comes in and says, “Welcome to Holland.” “Holland?!?” you say. “What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I’m supposed to be in Italy. All my life I’ve dreamed of going to Italy.” But there’s been a change in the flight plan. They’ve landed in Holland and there you must stay. The important thing is that they haven’t taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It’s just a different place. So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met. It’s just a different place. It’s slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you’ve been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around . . . and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills . . . and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts. But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy . . . and they’re all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say “Yes, that’s where I was supposed to go. That’s what I had planned.” And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away . . . because the loss of that dream is a very, very significant loss. But . . . if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn’t get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things . . . about Holland.

There were still pleasures to be had, if she could let them in.

She found ways to connect with her son, to enjoy him and love him for who he was and not focus on who he wasn’t.

How easy it is, I thought, to break someone’s heart, even when you take great care not to.

We all read personal thank-you notes to them, played music, and offered blessings, hoping that even though their bodies had been dismantled, their souls were intact and open to receiving our gratitude.

“Why become a doctor if you can write?” one professor asked after he had read something I’d written for a magazine.

Writing as a way to support a living as a doctor? Didn’t it used to be the other way around?.

Whenever I hear about saintly parents, I get suspicious. It’s not that I’m looking for problems. It’s just that no parent is a saint. Most of us end up being the “good-enough” parents that Donald Winnicott, the influential English pediatrician and child psychiatrist, believed was sufficient to raise a well-adjusted child.

“They fuck you up, your mum and dad, / They may not mean to, but they do.”.

There’s even a Wikipedia entry that catalogs movie characters and the personality disorders they exemplify.

People with borderline personality disorder are terrified of abandonment, but for some, that might mean feeling anxious when their partners don’t respond to texts right away; for others, that might mean choosing to stay in volatile, dysfunctional relationships rather than being alone.

His face turns bright red, and I wonder if he might yell at me too, but instead he just explodes with “Idiot!” “Me?” I ask. “You what?” “I remember you once described your last therapist as nice, but an idiot. Am I also nice, but an idiot?” “No, not at all,” he says, and I’m pleased that he’s able to acknowledge that somebody in his life isn’t an idiot. “Thank you,” I say. “For what?” “For saying I’m not an idiot.” “That’s not what I meant,” he replies. “I meant no, you’re not nice. You won’t let me use my phone to call the idiot who put mayonnaise on my sandwich.”.

For a second I can see how some people might find him charming.

The answer to an unasked question is always no, I repeated to myself over and over.

Denial is not a river in Egypt—and how even so, I went right back into denial: Maybe he’ll change his mind, I thought. Maybe this is all a big misunderstanding.

“You know what three words are even more romantic to me than ‘I love you’?” “You look beautiful?” he tried. “No,” his wife said. “I understand you.”).

People want to be understood and to understand, but for most of us, our biggest problem is that we don’t know what our problem is. We keep stepping in the same puddle. Why do I do the very thing that will guarantee my own unhappiness over and over again?.

Honesty is stronger medicine than sympathy, which may console but often conceals.

Meanwhile, she’d just dated a string of men who seemed excited at first but broke it off after two months.

“That patient sounds like your brother. That’s why you’re responding that way.”.

“Breakups are awful,” Claire says, popping some grapes in her mouth. “But we’d be negligent if we didn’t do them.”.

Carl Jung coined the term collective unconscious to refer to the part of the mind that holds ancestral memory, or experience that is common to all humankind.

We are afraid of something happening to our kids, our jobs. We are afraid of not having control and afraid of our own power. We are afraid of how briefly we are alive and how long we will be dead.

A man has a recurring dream that he’s been caught speeding on the freeway; a year into this dream, he begins to consider that his decades of cheating on his taxes—of positioning himself above the rules—might catch up with him.

Isn’t that I haven’t been able to write at all. In fact, during the time I was supposed to be writing my book, I was crafting fabulously witty and flirtatious emails to Boyfriend, all while telling friends and family and even Boyfriend that I was busy writing my book.

“Too many parents make life hard for their children by trying, too zealously, to make it easy for them.”.

Whenever one person in a family system starts to make changes, even if the changes are healthy and positive, it’s not unusual for other members in this system to do everything they can to maintain the status quo and bring things back to homeostasis. If an addict stops drinking, for instance, family members often unconsciously sabotage that person’s recovery, because in order to regain homeostasis in the system, somebody has to fill the role of the troubled person. And who wants that role? Sometimes people even resist positive changes in their friends: Why are you going to the gym so much? Why can’t you stay out late—you don’t need more sleep! Why are you working so hard for that promotion? You’re no fun anymore!.

If John’s wife becomes less depressed, how can John keep his role as the sane one in the couple?.

Men tend to be at a disadvantage here because they aren’t typically raised to have a working knowledge of their internal worlds; it’s less socially acceptable for men to talk about their feelings. While women feel cultural pressure to keep up their physical appearance, men feel that pressure to keep up their emotional appearance. Women tend to confide in friends or family members, but when men tell me how they feel in therapy, I’m almost always the first person they’ve said it to. Like my female patients, men struggle with marriage, self-esteem, identity, success, their parents, their childhoods, being loved and understood—and yet these topics can be tricky to bring up in any meaningful way with their male friends.

I haven’t seen him sit with his feelings this long before, and I’m impressed that he’s able to do so now. John’s eyes have darted down and to the side, which is what usually happens with someone when what I’m saying touches someplace vulnerable, and I’m glad. It’s impossible to grow without first becoming vulnerable. It looks like he’s still really taking this in, that for the first time, his impact on Margo is resonating. Finally John looks back up at me. “Hi, sorry, I had to mute you back there. They were taping. I missed that. What were you saying?”.

John wants me to call my own therapist to discuss why my patient isn’t happy with the therapy my therapist is doing with my patient’s wife.

Love can often look like so many things that don’t seem like love.

Anger is the go-to feeling for most people because it’s outward-directed—angrily blaming others can feel deliciously sanctimonious. But often it’s only the tip of the iceberg, and if you look beneath the surface, you’ll glimpse submerged feelings you either weren’t aware of or didn’t want to show: fear, helplessness, envy, loneliness, insecurity. And if you can tolerate these deeper feelings long enough to understand them and listen to what they’re telling you, you’ll not only manage your anger in more productive ways, you also won’t be so angry all the time.

I wonder if John needs people to be angry at him so that they won’t see his sadness.

Until you tell me what’s really on your mind, you’ll stay stuck exactly where you are.

“I think I can help,” he says, “but maybe not in the way you imagine. I can’t bring your boyfriend back, and I can’t give you a redo. And now you’re in this book situation and you want me to save you from that too. And I can’t do that either.” I let out a snort at how preposterous this is. “I don’t want you to save me,” I say. “I’m a head of household, not a damsel in distress.”.

PEACE. IT DOES NOT MEAN TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO NOISE, TROUBLE, OR HARD WORK. IT MEANS TO BE IN THE MIDST OF THOSE THINGS AND STILL BE CALM IN YOUR HEART.

I know that therapy won’t make all my problems disappear, prevent new ones from developing, or ensure that I’ll always act from a place of enlightenment. Therapists don’t perform personality transplants; they just help to take the sharp edges off.

I know that therapy won’t make all my problems disappear, prevent new ones from developing, or ensure that I’ll always act from a place of enlightenment. Therapists don’t perform personality transplants; they just help to take the sharp edges off. A patient may become less reactive or critical, more open and able to let people in. In other words, therapy is about understanding the self that you are. But part of getting to know yourself is to unknow yourself—to let go of the limiting stories you’ve told yourself about who you are so that you aren’t trapped by them, so you can live your life and not the story you’ve been telling yourself about your life.

But still, he frantically shakes the bars. That’s most of us. We feel completely stuck, trapped in our emotional cells, but there’s a way out—as long as we’re willing to see it.”.

Don’t be fooled. It may seem as though you’ve had an earth-shattering breakthrough, but this is just the beginning.

Freedom involves responsibility, and there’s a part of most of us that finds responsibility frightening.

“Insight is the booby prize of therapy”.

“Insight is the booby prize of therapy” is my favorite maxim of the trade, meaning that you can have all the insight in the world, but if you don’t change when you’re out in the world, the insight—and the therapy—is worthless. Insight allows you to ask yourself, Is this something that’s being done to me or am I doing it to myself? The answer gives you choices, but it’s up to you to make them.

Babies can die from lack of touch, and so can adults (adults who are touched regularly live longer). There’s even a term for this condition: skin hunger.

“Are you trying to tell me you’re having marital problems?” “Yes.” “He’s farting again?” “Yes.” It’s their ongoing joke. Jen has warned her husband that she’s moving into the next room at night if he keeps eating dairy, but he loves dairy and she loves him, so she never moves.

Talking can keep people in their heads and safely away from their emotions.

Talking can keep people in their heads and safely away from their emotions. Being silent is like emptying the trash. When you stop tossing junk into the void—words, words, and more words—something important rises to the surface. And when the silence is a shared experience, it can be a gold mine for thoughts and feelings that the patient didn’t even know existed.

Even great joy is sometimes best expressed through silence, as when a patient comes in after landing a hard-won promotion or getting engaged and can’t find the words to express the magnitude of what she’s feeling. So we sit in silence together, beaming.

In fact, it had never occurred to me to Google Wendell until he suggested that by Google-stalking Boyfriend I was holding on to a future that had been canceled.

Past. I’d need to accept that his future and mine, his present and mine, were now separate and that all we had left in common was our history.

Angela L. was becoming less angry at the world, less prone to blaming others for her unhappiness (what we call externalizing).

She was approaching “emotional sobriety”—the ability to regulate one’s feelings without self-medicating, whether that medication comes in the form of substances, defenses, affairs, or the internet.

“You sound like my ten-year-old. What makes you think life is supposed to be fair?”.

It’s no coincidence that people who had angry parents often end up choosing angry partners, that those with alcoholic parents are frequently drawn to partners who drink quite a bit, or that those who had withdrawn or critical parents find themselves married to spouses who are withdrawn or critical.

It’s no coincidence that people who had angry parents often end up choosing angry partners, that those with alcoholic parents are frequently drawn to partners who drink quite a bit, or that those who had withdrawn or critical parents find themselves married to spouses who are withdrawn or critical. Why would people do this to themselves? Because the pull toward that feeling of “home” makes what they want as adults hard to disentangle from what they experienced as children.

Maybe this time, the unconscious imagines, I can go back and heal that wound from long ago by engaging with somebody familiar—but new.

I was once told by a supervisor that every therapist has the experience of seeing a patient with whom the similarities are so striking that this person feels like your doppelgänger.

It wasn’t just that we looked alike and had similar reading habits, mannerisms, and default ways of thinking (over- and negative).

He may be resistant to acknowledging it now, but I welcome his resistance because resistance is a clue to where the crux of the work lies; it signals what a therapist needs to pay attention to.

“Resistance is a therapist’s friend. Don’t fight it—follow it.”.

People communicate through their attendance—whether they’re prompt or late, cancel an hour beforehand, or don’t show up at all.

When I did let myself think about it, I’d go online and learn that I was dying of basically everything, only to remember that in medical school, we students suffered from “medical students’ disease.” This is an actual phenomenon, documented in the literature, in which medical students believe that they’re suffering from whatever illnesses they happen to be studying. On the day we studied the lymphatic system, a group of us felt each other’s lymph nodes over dinner. One student put her hands on my neck and exclaimed, “Whoa!” “Whoa what?” I asked. She made a face. “It feels like lymphoma.” I lifted my arms and felt my neck. She was right; I had lymphoma! Several other classmates felt my neck and agreed—I was toast. Better check my white cell count, they said. Let’s biopsy those nodes!.

He liked Rita’s worldliness and wry observations and wise counsel whenever he asked her advice. He adored her throaty laugh and her eyes that were green in the sunlight and brown indoors and her bright red hair and her values.

He loved that if they started a conversation on one topic, it would segue into two or three others before it would loop back around or that sometimes they’d get so immersed in their tangents that they’d forget what they’d been talking about in the first place.

Taped up next to my files is the word ultracrepidarianism, which means “the habit of giving opinions and advice on matters outside of one’s knowledge or competence.”.

“The speed of light is outdated,” she said dryly. “Today, everybody moves at the speed of want.”.

“They want to buy a solution to a problem.”.

In a state of perpetual distraction, they seemed to be losing the ability to be with others and losing their ability to be with themselves.

It’s a story about avoidance. Everything I’ve told him since coming to therapy has been about avoidance, and we both know that avoidance is almost always about fear. Avoidance of seeing the clues that Boyfriend and I had irreconcilable differences. Avoidance of writing the happiness book. Avoidance of talking about not writing the happiness book. Avoidance of thinking about my parents getting older. Avoidance of the fact that my son is growing up. Avoidance of my mysterious illness. I remember something I learned during my internship: “Avoidance is a simple way of coping by not having to cope.”.

If I screw up my life, I can engineer my own death rather than have it happen to me. It may not be what I want, but at least I’ll choose it. Like cutting off my nose to spite my face, this is a way to say, Take that, uncertainty.

Self-sabotage as a form of control. If I screw up my life, I can engineer my own death rather than have it happen to me.

If I hide in fear instead of facing what’s wrong with my body, I can create a living death—but one where I call the shots.

The four ultimate concerns are death, isolation, freedom, and meaninglessness.

“Okay, you win,” he begins with a sigh. “Win what?” I ask. “The pleasure of my company,” he deadpans. I raise my eyebrows. “The explanation to the mystery,” he continues. “I’m going to tell you the story. So, lucky you—you win.”.

If his love for his wife was romantic and warm, his love for his kids was like a volcano.

I think about how it’s the not knowing that torments all of us.

It’s the not knowing that torments John.

“You’re so focused on being a good dad,” I say to John, “but maybe part of being a good dad is allowing yourself the full range of human emotions, of really living, even if living fully can sometimes be harder than not.

Whereas Freud believed that people are driven to seek pleasure and avoid pain (his famous pleasure principle), Frankl maintained that people’s primary drive isn’t toward pleasure but toward finding meaning in their lives.

“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”.

More than sixty years later, Wendell was saying I could choose too—that the jail cell was open on both sides.

“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”.

Wendell and I existed in a separate universe where he saw me in ways that even those close to me didn’t. Of course, it’s also true that my family and friends saw aspects of me that Wendell would never see, but nobody would quite understand the subtext of my email as precisely as Wendell would.

“I can’t picture a world without him in it,” I say. “I can’t imagine not being able to call and hear his voice or ask his advice or laugh together about something we both find funny.” I think about how there’s nothing in the world like laughing with my dad. I think about how knowledgeable he is on almost any topic and how fully he loves me and how kind he is—not just to me, but to everyone. The first thing people say about my father isn’t how smart or funny he is, though he is both. The first thing they say is “He’s so sweet.”.

“As your eyes are opening, his are beginning to close,”.

For Rita, joy isn’t pleasure; it’s anticipatory pain.

Why do parents do this? Often, they envy their children’s childhoods—the opportunities they have; the financial or emotional stability that the parents provide; the fact that their children have their whole lives ahead of them, a stretch of time that’s now in the parents’ pasts. They strive to give their children all the things they themselves didn’t have, but they sometimes end up, without even realizing it, resenting the kids for their good fortune.

“How long do you think the sentence for this crime should be? A year? Five? Ten?” Many of us torture ourselves over our mistakes for decades, even after we’ve genuinely attempted to make amends. How reasonable is that sentence?.

Is there anything that makes us feel more vulnerable than asking someone, Do you like me?.

“Just because she sends you guilt doesn’t mean you have to accept delivery.”.

“Just because she sends you guilt doesn’t mean you have to accept delivery.” I think about this with Charlotte: I don’t want her to feel guilty for leaving, to feel that she has let me down. All I can do is let her know that I am here for her either way,.

Those ten minutes of waiting and wondering were definitely not “fine.”.

We both knew how relieved I was to see him and how important he had become to me. Those ten minutes of waiting and wondering were definitely not “fine.”.

People imagine they come to therapy to uncover something from the past and talk it through, but so much of what therapists do is work in the present, where we bring awareness to what’s going on in people’s heads and hearts in the day-to-day.

“What people do in therapy is like shooting baskets against a backboard. It’s necessary. But what they need to do then is go and play in an actual game.”.

Some people hope that therapy will help them find a way to be heard by whoever they feel wronged them, at which point those lovers or relatives will see the light and become the people they’d wished for all along.

Some people hope that therapy will help them find a way to be heard by whoever they feel wronged them, at which point those lovers or relatives will see the light and become the people they’d wished for all along. But it rarely happens like that. At some point, being a fulfilled adult means taking responsibility for the course of your own life and accepting the fact that now you’re in charge of your choices. You have to move to the front seat and be the mommy dog driving the car.”.

There’s no hierarchy of pain.

There’s no hierarchy of pain. Suffering shouldn’t be ranked, because pain is not a contest.

And then he starts crying, a guttural wail, raw and wild, and I recognize it instantly. It’s the sound I heard in the ER back in medical school from the parents of the drowned toddler. It’s a love song to his beloved son.

You want to mute the pain? You’ll also mute the joy.

“You’re both so alone in your grief,” I say. “And in your joy.”.

I told Rita what I tell everyone who’s afraid of getting hurt in relationships—which is to say, everyone with a heartbeat. I explained to her that even in the best possible relationship, you’re going to get hurt sometimes, and no matter how much you love somebody, you will at times hurt that person, not because you want to, but because you’re human. You will inevitably hurt your partner, your parents, your children, your closest friend—and they will hurt you—because if you sign up for intimacy, getting hurt is part of the deal. But,.

“Every laugh and good time that comes my way feels ten times better than before I knew such sadness.”.

“Maybe,” I say, “instead of worrying about them, you can love them. All you can do is find a way to love them that’s about what they need from you and not what you need from them right now.”.

Everyone should have at least one epic love story in their lives, Julie concluded. Ours was that for me. If we’re lucky, we might get two. I wish you another epic love story.

I believe in you. I can see possibilities that you might not see quite yet. I imagine that something different can happen, in some form or another.

Relationships in life don’t really end, even if you never see the person again.

Relationships in life don’t really end, even if you never see the person again. Every person you’ve been close to lives on somewhere inside you. Your past lovers, your parents, your friends, people both alive and dead (symbolically or literally)—all of them evoke memories, conscious or not. Often they inform how you relate to yourself and others. Sometimes you have conversations with them in your head; sometimes they speak to you in your sleep.


# Norwegian Wood (Haruki Murakami)

Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.

"I know these things. I'm always right. It's got nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I'm really close to you like this, I'm not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil could ever tempt me.".

What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?.

Once, long ago, when I was still young, when the memories were far more vivid than they are now, I often tried to write about her. But I couldn't produce a line. I knew that if that first line would come, the rest would pour itself onto the page, but I could never make it happen.

Everything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to start - the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.

I didn't know why the flag had to be taken down at night. The nation continued to exist while it was dark, and plenty of people worked all night - railway construction crews and taxi drivers and bar hostesses and firemen and night watchmen: it seemed unfair to me that such people were denied the protection of the flag. Or maybe it didn't matter all that much and nobody really cared - aside from me. Not that I really cared, either. It was just something that happened to cross my mind.

I was impressed by the variety of dreams and goals that life could offer.

This was one of the very first new impressions I received when I came to Tokyo for the first time. The thought struck me that society needed a few people - just a few - who were interested in and even passionate about mapmaking.

And a lot prettier than I remembered. I wanted to tell her that, but couldn't find a good way to put it.

We had never really had much to say to each other.

Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate from and independent of life. The hand of death is bound to take us, I had felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This had seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over there. I am here, not over there.

Death was not the opposite of life. It was already here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that.

We could face each other over coffee cups in total silence.

He was a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least 30 years.

He was a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least 30 years. "That's the only kind of book I can trust," he said. "It's not that I don't believe in contemporary literature," he added, "but I don't want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had the baptism of time.

"That's why I read them. If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. That's the world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of themselves doing that.

I saw Nagasawa drunk and tormenting.

"That proves you're a decent human being," he said. "Congratulations.

When you're surrounded by endless possibilities, one of the hardest things you can do is pass them up. See what I mean?".

Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around, but she never complained to him.

Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around, but she never complained to him. She was seriously in love, but she never made demands.

"Nobody likes being alone. I just hate to be disappointed.'.

"Tell me, Nagasawa," I asked, "what is the "standard of action' in your life?" "You'll laugh if I tell you," he said. "No I won't." "All right," he said. "To be a gentleman." I didn't laugh, but I nearly fell off my chair. "To be a gentleman? A gentleman?" "You heard me." "What does it mean to be a gentleman? How do you define it?".

I didn't laugh, but I nearly fell off my chair. "To be a gentleman? A gentleman?" "You heard me." "What does it mean to be a gentleman? How do you define it?" "A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do but what he should do.".

"You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

"It's because you show it," she said. "You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

"Maybe so," I said. "Maybe that's why people don't like me. Never have." "It's because you show it," she said. "You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

But if they - my father and mother - had loved me a little more, I would have been able to feel more - to feel real sadness, for example.".

Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more.

Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just once. But they never gave that to me. Never, not once. If I tried to cuddle up and beg for something, they'd just shove me away and yell at me. "No! That costs too much!' It's all I ever heard. So I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me uncon- ditionally 365 days a year. I was still in primary school at the time, but I made up my mind once and for all.".

"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone, I feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until there's nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the earth.

In doing so, however,.

Can't do what you can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass.

I can't do what you can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass.

As long as we are here, we can get by without hurting others or being hurt by them because we know that we are "deformed". That's what distinguishes us from the outside world: most people go about their lives unconscious of their deformities, while in this little world of ours the deformities themselves are a precondition.

"What should I do, then? Give me an example.".

"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone, I feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until there's nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the earth. And all that stays behind are my clothes. That's how it feels to me, waiting indoors all day.".

At first she tried to get me to sing bass harmony, but I was so bad she gave up and sang alone to her heart's content.

Say this not as an excuse or a means of self- justification but because it is true. If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you realize. Which is precisely why I do not want you to hate me. Because if you were to do that, I would really go to pieces. I can't do what you can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass.

Just as each person has certain idiosyncrasies in the way he or she walks, people have idiosyncrasies in the way they think and feel and see things, and though you might want to correct them, it doesn't happen overnight, and if you try to force the issue in one case, something else might go funny.

It may well be that we can never fully adapt to our own deformities.

The one thing I don't want to be is a burden to anyone.

I told Naoko about Storm Trooper's sudden disappearance and about the last day I saw him, when he gave me the firefly.

"What do we talk about? Just ordinary things. What happened that day, or books we've read, or tomorrow's weather, you know. Don't tell me you're wondering if people jump to their feet and shout stuff like: "It'll rain tomorrow if a polar bear eats the stars tonight!"'.

You don't have to convince anybody of anything, and you don't have to attract anyone's attention.".

"But don't ever tell another woman that you find her wrinkles attractive," she added. "I like to hear it, but I'm the exception.".

"Such perfect little circles are impossible to maintain.

I couldn't tell the difference between his strong points and his flaws, they were all the same to me.

"If you stay here long enough, you can pretty much tell the weather by the smell of the air," said Reiko.

Have a lot more patience for others than I have for myself, and I'm much better at bringing out the best in others than in myself. That's just the kind of person I am. I'm the scratchy stuff on the side of the matchbox. But that's fine with me. I don't mind at all. Better to be a first-class matchbox than a second-class match.

I'm the scratchy stuff on the side of the matchbox. But that's fine with me. I don't mind at all. Better to be a first-class matchbox than a second-class match.

People are always trying to force stuff on me. The minute they see me they start telling me what to do. At least you don't try to force stuff on me." "I don't know you well enough to force stuff on you." "You mean, if you knew me better, you'd force stuff on me like everyone else?" "It's possible," I said. "That's how people live in the real world: forcing stuff on each other.".

"I suppose so. I kind of doubt that anyone thinks about the stock market or verb conjugations or the Suez Canal when they wank. Nope, I'm pretty sure just about everybody thinks about girls.".

"You know, Watanabe, you're really good at explaining things to people.".

I'm way too busy as it is.".

Reiko says it's good I can cry. But feeling lonely really hurts.

I spent the next few days buying the things I needed in the nearby Kichijoji shopping district and started cooking simple meals for myself at home.

No truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one.

This: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow.

This: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning.

By "those guys" Reiko of course meant John Lennon, Paul Mc Cartney and George Harrison. After a short breather, Reiko crushed her cigarette out and picked up her guitar again. She played "Penny Lane", "Blackbird", "Julia", "When I'm 64", "Nowhere Man", "And I Love Her", and "Hey Jude".

"Letters are just pieces of paper," I said. "Burn them, and what stays in your heart will stay; keep them, and what vanishes will vanish.".

"I have a million things to talk to you about. A million things we have to talk about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.".


# Coraline (Neil Gaiman)

There was also a well. On the first day Coraline’s family moved in, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made a point of telling Coraline how dangerous the well was, and they warned her to be sure she kept away from it. So Coraline set off to explore for it, so that she knew where it was, to keep away from it properly. She found it on the third day, in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court, behind a clump of trees—a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass.

Coraline went over to the window and watched the rain come down. It wasn’t the kind of rain you could go out in—it was the other kind, the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed. It was rain that meant business, and currently its business was turning the garden into a muddy, wet soup.

She sorted through them carefully, and selected the oldest, biggest, blackest, rustiest key.

“Cats don’t have names,” it said. “No?” said Coraline. “No,” said the cat. “Now, you people have names. That’s because you don’t know who you are. We know who we are, so we don’t need names.”.

“It wasn’t brave because he wasn’t scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. That was brave.”.

“Because,” she said, “when you’re scared but you still do it anyway, that’s brave.”.

“But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?” “Easy,” said the cat. “Think of somebody walking around the world. You start out walking away from something and end up coming back to it.”.

“And will there be gray, wet days where I just don’t know what to do and there’s nothing to read or to watch and nowhere to go and the day drags on forever?”.

“What’s in a name?” asked Miss Forcible. “That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”.

“The air was alive with yellow wasps. We must have stepped on a wasps’ nest in a rotten branch as we walked. And while I was running up the hill, my dad stayed and got stung, to give me time to run away. His glasses had fallen off when he ran.

“You really don’t understand, do you?” she said. “I don’t want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted?.


# Skyward (Brandon Sanderson)

The crack in the cavern roof looked a hundred meters away. I hated being so small. Any day now, I was going to grow tall like my father. Then for once I wouldn’t be the smallest kid around. I’d laugh at everyone from up so high, they’d be forced to admit how great I was.

It’s just that a lot of people find the sky intimidating, Spensa.”.

“Only a fool thinks that weapons are more important than strategy and motion!”.

“Tomorrow let me tell you again of Sun Tzu, the greatest general of all time. He taught that position and preparation won wars—not swords or spears. A great man, Sun Tzu. He was your ancestor, you know.”.

All the greatest warriors fight for peace, Spensa. Remember that.”.

You couldn’t win every fight, and there was no shame in losing when you were outnumbered.

“Military protocol. When you get important enough to order an armada into battle, you’re too important to interfere with how a quartermaster runs his shop.

“That music the water makes,” she said. “Isn’t it the most wonderful sound ever?”.

The warrior cannot choose her bed; she must bless the stars if she can choose her battlefield.

When we are able to attack, we must seem unable. When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
