When everyone looks at you as the coward’s daughter—not a coward’s daughter, but the singular Coward’s Daughter—you develop an attitude.”.

“Pride is a virtue in those who make it one.”.

It didn’t just talk—it seemed to have trouble stopping.

“I am a machine, and my conclusions are therefore logical—while yours are biased by organic irrationality.” He made a few lights on his dash blink. “That is a clever way of saying you are the stupid one, in case you—”.

“I am a machine, and my conclusions are therefore logical—while yours are biased by organic irrationality.” He made a few lights on his dash blink. “That is a clever way of saying you are the stupid one, in case you—” “I understood,” I said. “Thanks.” “You’re welcome!”.

“Everyone treats me really strangely once they see the pin. Like, they listen to what I say, and tell me my ideas are good—even if they aren’t. And people make way for me, like I’m someone important.”.

Two other pilots had died as well, and composing letters to their families would take a bite out of her evening, but she’d do it. To those families, the loss would take a bite out of their lives.

“I refuse to be trapped by bonds of autocracy and nationalism,”.

“As the Saint always said, true failure is choosing to fail.”.

Good people were brave. Bad people were cowards. I knew my father had been a good person, so it was obvious to me that he couldn’t have run away. End of story. Close the book.

“I hope you enjoy being a hero when your corpse is rotting like your friend’s, alone in a wasteland, forgotten and ignored.”.

“I need something to do,” I said. “Something other than just sitting.

“I need something to do,” I said. “Something other than just sitting there, dwelling on what I’ve lost.”.

“If you don’t say what you’re thinking,” Kimmalyn said solemnly, “then it will stay in your head.”.

“Some humans like to be given time to grieve on their own. I will stop speaking to you for two days, to see if isolation provides the needed support. Please enjoy moving through the stages of grief.”.

But one thing I can’t believe is that someone is destined to be a coward or a traitor. No, I can’t accept that. I could never accept that.”.

“It has always seemed to me,” she said, “that a coward is a person who cares more about what people say than about what is right. Bravery isn’t about what people call you, Spensa. It’s about who you know yourself to be.”.

Victorious warriors win first and then go to war.

Brave until the end. No backing down, Spin.

“Hello!” M-Bot said to me from the cockpit. “You have nearly died, and so I will say something to distract you from the serious, mind-numbing implications of your own mortality! I hate your shoes.”.

“I didn’t want to be predictable,” M-Bot added. “So I said that I hate them. But actually, I think those shoes are quite nice. Please do not think I have lied.”.

The answer is not to fear the spark, but to learn to control it.


# Save the Cat! (Blake Snyder)

(On second thought, are you SURE you want this published, Blake? It might beef up the competition!).

There are lots of good screenwriting how-to's out there. And if you want to see where it all began, look to the master, Syd Field, who started it all and taught everybody.

I like Viki King's book with the improbable title of How to Write a Movie in 21 Days. Improbable, yes, but I've done it — and sold the script I wrote, too.

I also value Joseph Campbell's work. Hero With A Thousand Faces remains the best book about storytelling ever.

Because liking the person we go on a journey with is the single most important element in drawing us into the story.

The problem for us, the spec screenwriters of the world, is that we don't own any of these pre-sold franchises nor are we likely to. We're the guys and gals with a laptop computer and a dream.

(Please note: Anything "from hell" is always a comedy plus.).

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is: irony.

One of my personal favorites is producer David Permut's pitch for Blind Date: "She's the perfect woman — until she has a drink." I don't know about you, but I see it. I see a beautiful girl and a date gone bad and a guy who wants to save it because... she's the one! There's a lot going on in that one-line, far more than in the actual movie, but that's a different subject altogether. The point is that a good logline, in addition to pulling you in, has to offer the promise of more.

If you don't have the logline, maybe you should rethink your whole movie.

No matter who is encouraging you on the friend side of your life, it's the strangers you really need to impress.

Movies are intricately made emotion machines.

A hero goes "on the road" in search of one thing and winds up discovering something else — himself.

Psyche. "I wish I had a_" is probably the single most frequently spoken prayer since Adam.

"An ordinary guy finds himself in extraordinary circumstances.".

When A Man Loves A Woman.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

Each has a breakout character whose role is to expose the group goal as a fraud.

When we put on a uniform, be it the uniform of the Army or a comfortable cotton shirt with a little polo player over the pocket, we give up who we are to a certain extent.

Indeed our identification with him must come from sympathy for the plight of being misunderstood.

True originality can't begin until you know what you're breaking away from.

Survival, hunger, sex, protection of loved ones, and fear of death grab us.

A guy gets a talking car. Knowing what you know about how to amp up the hero, the bad guy, and the primal goal, write a logline for that idea. And make sure you use adjectives that grab us.

"You have to be this tall to go on this ride.".

Had delivered on the promise of the premise.

One night I taped the old comedy classic What's Up, Doc?, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. And I discovered, the next day as I topped the mountain crest, that the movie was perfectly, evenly divided into two halves and that its midpoint was a "down.".

Experienced as I topped the mountain pass and the first half of What's Up, Doc? that I had taped came to an end. The movie had two even halves! The power and the purpose of a strong midpoint was forever clear to me. After that I began to see how many movies had midpoints that changed the whole dynamic of the film. But the midpoint does more than present an "up" or "down." You will hear the phrase "the stakes are raised at the midpoint" in a lot of script meetings. Because they are. It's the point where the fun and games are over. It's back to the story! It's also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-the-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

It's also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-the-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

The rule is: It's never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All Is Lost point.

Screenplays are structure. Precisely made Swiss clocks of emotion.

Here's a great rule of thumb: A hero never asks questions! The hero knows and others around him look to him for answers, not the other way around. If you see a lot of question marks in your hero's dialogue, there's a problem. The hero knows; he never asks.

Good dialogue tells us more about what's going on in its subtext than on its surface.

It's been done, babe, it's been done.


# Wonder (R. J. Palacio)

But I know ordinary kids don’t make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds.


# Sanderson's First Law | Brandon Sanderson (brandonsanderson.com)

An author’s ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.

Magic creates problems, then people solve those problems on their own without much magic.

We have books where the magic is included in order to establish a sense of wonder and give the setting a fantastical feel. Books that focus on this use of magic tend to want to indicate that men are a small, small part of the eternal and mystical workings of the universe. This gives the reader a sense of tension as they’re never certain what dangers—or wonders—the characters will encounter.

There is a reason that Gandalf doesn’t just fly Frodo to Mount Doom with magic, then let him drop the ring in. Narratively, that just doesn’t work with the magic system. We don’t know what it can do, and so if the writer uses it to solve a lot of problems, then the tension in the novel ends up feeling weak. The magic undermines the plot instead enhancing it.


# Maybe You Should Talk to Someone (Lori Gottlieb)

It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them.

It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them. We should take the world’s enemies, get them in a room to share their histories and formative experiences, their fears and their struggles, and global adversaries would suddenly get along. I’ve found something likable in literally everyone I’ve seen as a therapist, including the guy who attempted murder. (Beneath his rage, he turned out to be a real sweetheart.).


# Story (Robert McKee)

Later, before entering the university, I deduced that the best possible life includes as many rounds of golf as possible, and therefore, I would become a dentist. “Dentist?!” my mother laughed. “You can’t be serious. What happens when they cure all teeth problems? Where will dentists be then? No, Bobby, people will always need entertainment. I’m looking out for your future. You’re going into show business.”.

Anxious, inexperienced writers obey rules. Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules. Artists master the form.

No one needs yet another recipe book on how to reheat Hollywood leftovers.

Mother and daughter clash over the demands of dependence versus independence, permanence versus change, self versus others—conflicts every family knows.

Stereotypical stories stay at home, archetypal stories travel.

The cinema’s master storytellers give us the double-edged encounter we crave.

First, the discovery of a world we do not know. No matter how intimate or epic, contemporary or historical, concrete or fantasized, the world of an eminent artist always strikes us as somewhat exotic or strange.

We go to the movies to enter a new, fascinating world, to inhabit vicariously another human being who at first seems so unlike us and yet at heart is like us, to live in a fictional reality that illuminates our daily reality.

Pascal once wrote a long, drawn-out letter to a friend, then apologized in the postscript that he didn’t have time to write a short one.

A story is not only what you have to say but how you say it. If content is cliché, the telling will be cliché. But if your vision is deep and original, your story design will be unique.

A mature artist never calls attention to himself, and a wise artist never does anything merely because it breaks convention.

Stories are equipment for living.

How should a human being lead his life?.

The world now consumes films, novels, theatre, and television in such quantities and with such ravenous hunger that the story arts have become humanity’s prime source of inspiration, as it seeks to order chaos and gain insight into life. Our appetite for story is a reflection of the profound human need to grasp the patterns of living, not merely as an intellectual exercise, but within a very personal, emotional experience. In the words of playwright Jean Anouilh, “Fiction gives life its form.”.

The hard-to-believe truth is that what we see on the screen each year is a reasonable reflection of the best writing of the last few years.

With rare exceptions, unrecognized genius is a myth.

For writers who can tell a quality story, it’s a seller’s market—always has been, always will be.

Today’s would-be writers rush to the typewriter without first learning their craft.

Experience, however, is overrated. Of course we want writers who don’t hide from life, who live deeply, observe closely. This is vital but never enough. For most writers, the knowledge they gain from reading and study equals or outweighs experience, especially if that experience goes unexamined. Self-knowledge is the key—life plus deep reflection on our reactions to life.

To that end scholars such as William Archer, Kenneth Rowe, and John Howard Lawson wrote excellent books on dramaturgy and the prose arts. Their method was intrinsic, drawing strength from the big-muscle movements of desire, forces of antagonism, turning points, spine, progression, crisis, climax—story seen from the inside out.

As a result, with some notable exceptions, the current generation of writers has been undereducated in the prime principles of story.

European academics generally deny that writing can, in any sense, be taught, and as a result, courses in Creative Writing have never been included in the curriculum of Continental universities.

Who are these characters? What do they want? Why do they want it? How do they go about getting it? What stops them? What are the consequences? Finding the answers to these grand questions and shaping them into story is our overwhelming creative task.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story demands both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought.

Designing story tests the maturity and insight of the writer, his knowledge of society, nature, and the human heart. Story demands both vivid imagination and powerful analytic thought. Self-expression is never an issue, for, wittingly or unwittingly, all stories, honest and dishonest, wise and foolish, faithfully mirror their maker, exposing his humanity … or lack of it. Compared to this terror, writing dialogue is a sweet diversion.

The idea of story is like the idea of music. We’ve heard tunes all our lives. We can dance and sing along. We think we understand music until we try to compose it and what comes out of the piano scares the cat.

If both TENDER MERCIES and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK are wonderful stories beautifully told for the screen—and they are—what on earth do they have in common? If HANNAH AND HER SISTERS and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL are both brilliant comic stories delightfully told, and they are, where do they touch? Compare THE CRYING GAME to PARENTHOOD, TERMINATOR to REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, UNFORGIVEN to EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. Or A FISH CALLED WANDA to MAN BITES DOG, WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT to RESERVOIR DOGS. Moving back through the decades, compare VERTIGO to 8 1/2 to PERSONA to RASHOMON to CASABLANCA to GREED to MODERN TIMES to THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN—all superb screen stories, all vastly different, yet all produce the same result: an audience leaving the theatre exclaiming, “What a great story!”.

“Good story” means something worth telling that the world wants to hear.

It begins with talent. You must be born with the creative power to put things together in a way no one has ever dreamed.

All that … and, as Hallie and Whit Burnett reveal in their excellent little book, a lot of love.

The love of story—the belief that your vision can be expressed only through story, that characters can be more “real” than people, that the fictional world is more profound than the concrete. The love of the dramatic—a fascination with the sudden surprises and revelations that bring sea-changes in life. The love of truth—the belief that lies cripple the artist, that every truth in life must be questioned, down to one’s own secret motives. The love of humanity—a willingness to empathize with suffering souls, to crawl inside their skins and see the world through their eyes. The love of sensation—the desire to indulge not only the physical but the inner senses. The love of dreaming—the pleasure in taking leisurely rides on your imagination just to see where it leads. The love of humor—a joy in the saving grace that restores the balance of life. The love of language—the delight in sound and sense, syntax and semantics. The love of duality—a feel for life’s hidden contradictions, a healthy suspicion that things are not what they seem. The love of perfection—the passion to write and rewrite in pursuit of the perfect moment. The love of uniqueness—the thrill of audacity and a stone-faced calm when it is met by ridicule. The love of beauty—an innate sense that treasures good writing, hates bad writing, and knows the difference. The love of self—a strength that doesn’t need to be constantly reassured, that never doubts that you are indeed a writer. You must love to write and bear the loneliness. But the love of a good story, of terrific characters and a world driven by your passion, courage, and creative gifts is still not enough. Your goal must be a good story well told.

Without craft, the best a writer can do is snatch the first idea off the top of his head, then sit helpless in front of his own work, unable to answer the dreaded questions: Is it good? Or is it sewage? If sewage, what do I do?.

This writer believes that the more precise his observation of day-to-day facts, the more accurate his reportage of what actually happens, the more truth he tells. But fact, no matter how minutely observed, is truth with a small “t.” Big “T” Truth is located behind, beyond, inside, below the surface of things, holding reality together or tearing it apart, and cannot be directly observed. Because this writer sees only what is visible and factual, he is blind to the truth of life.

Story is metaphor for life.

A storyteller is a life poet, an artist who transforms day-to-day living, inner life and outer life, dream and actuality into a poem whose rhyme scheme is events rather than words—a two-hour metaphor that says: Life is like this! Therefore, a story must abstract from life to discover its essences, but not become an abstraction that loses all sense of life-as-lived.

What happens is fact, not truth. Truth is what we think about what happens.

At one end of reality is pure fact; at the other end, pure imagination.

The material of literary talent is words; the material of story talent is life itself.

It’s the currency of human contact.

Master storytellers know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal.

Master storytellers know how to squeeze life out of the least of things, while poor storytellers reduce the profound to the banal. You may have the insight of a Buddha, but if you cannot tell story, your ideas turn dry as chalk.

The mark of a master is to select only a few moments but give us a lifetime.

One purpose may be to express your feelings, but this becomes self-indulgence if it doesn’t result in arousing emotions in the audience.

“Event” means change. If the streets outside your window are dry, but after a nap you see they’re wet, you assume an event has taken place, called rain.

STORY VALUES are the universal qualities of human experience that may shift from positive to negative, or negative to positive, from one moment to the next.

Alive/dead (positive/negative) is a story value, as are love/hate, freedom/slavery, truth/lie, courage/cowardice, loyalty/betrayal, wisdom/stupidity, strength/weakness, excitement/boredom and so on.

A Story Event creates meaningful change in the life situation of a character that is expressed and experienced in terms of a value and ACHIEVED THROUGH CONFLICT.

Into it comes a man who imagines himself a “rainmaker.” This character has deep inner conflict between his passionate belief that he can bring rain, although he has never been able to do it, and his terrible fear that he’s a fool or mad. He meets a woman, falls in love, then suffers as she tries to believe in him, but turns away, convinced he’s a charlatan or worse. He has a strong conflict with society—some follow him as if he’s a messiah; others want to stone him out of town. Lastly, he faces implacable conflict with the physical world—the hot winds, empty skies, parched earth. If this man can struggle through all his inner and personal conflicts, against social and environmental forces and finally coax rain out of a cloudless sky, that storm would be majestic and sublimely meaningful—for it is change motivated through conflict. What I have described is THE RAINMAKER, adapted to the screen by Richard Nash from his own play.

A SCENE is an action through conflict in more or less continuous time and space that turns the value-charged condition of a character’s life on at least one value with a degree of perceptible significance. Ideally, every scene is a STORY EVENT.

What value is at stake in my character’s life at this moment? Love? Truth? What? How is that value charged at the top of the scene? Positive? Negative? Some of both? Make a note. Next turn to the close of the scene and ask, Where is this value now? Positive? Negative? Both? Make a note and compare. If the answer you write down at the end of the scene is the same note you made at the opening, you now have another important question to ask: Why is this scene in my script?.

The answer is almost certain to be “exposition.” It’s there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience.

The answer is almost certain to be “exposition.” It’s there to convey information about characters, world, or history to the eavesdropping audience. If exposition is a scene’s sole justification, a disciplined writer will trash it and weave its information into the film elsewhere.

A BEAT is an exchange of behavior in action/reaction. Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene.

“If I left you, baby, you’d be so miserable …” but he calls her bluff with “That’s a misery I’d love.”.

An ACT is a series of sequences that peaks in a climactic scene which causes a major reversal of values, more powerful in its impact than any previous sequence or scene.

When you look at the value-charged situation in the life of the character at the beginning of the story, then compare it to the value-charge at the end of the story, you should see the arc of the film, the great sweep of change that takes life from one condition at the opening to a changed condition at the end. This final condition, this end change, must be absolute and irreversible.

The writer redrafts inspiration again and again, making it look as if an instinctive spontaneity created the film, yet knowing how much effort and unnaturalness went into making it look natural and effortless.

Plot is the writer’s choice of events and their design in time.

A story in which the arc of the film takes place within the mind of the protagonist.

This collection of timeless principles I call the Archplot: Arch (pronounced “ark” as in archangel) in the dictionary sense of “eminent above others of the same kind.”.

A FISH CALLED WANDA.

The Archplot delivers a closed ending—all questions raised by the story are answered; all emotions evoked are satisfied. The audience leaves with a rounded, closed experience—nothing in doubt, nothing unsated.

Most of the emotion evoked by the film will be satisfied, but an emotional residue may be left for the audience to satisfy.

In an ideal world art and politics would never touch. In reality they can’t keep their hands off each other.

The art film’s focus on inner conflict draws the interest of those with advanced degrees, because the inner world is where the highly educated spend a large amount of time.

If the audience shrinks, the budget must shrink. This is the law.

Don’t kid yourself into thinking that you understand Archplot because you’ve seen the movies. You’ll know you understand it when you can do it.

Are you in love with the art in yourself or yourself in the art?.

He avoids closure, active characters, chronology, and causality to avoid the taint of commercialism. As a result, pretentiousness poisons his work.

The writer does not know the world of his story.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own. They reheat literary leftovers and serve up plates of boredom because, regardless of their talents, they lack an in-depth understanding of their story’s setting and all it contains.

From the works of other writers they crib scenes we’ve seen before, paraphrase dialogue we’ve heard before, disguise characters we’ve met before, and pass them off as their own. They reheat literary leftovers and serve up plates of boredom because, regardless of their talents, they lack an in-depth understanding of their story’s setting and all it contains. Knowledge of and insight into the world of your story is fundamental to the achievement of originality and excellence.

Within any world, no matter how imaginary, only certain events are possible or probable.

No matter how realistic or bizarre the setting, once its causal principles are established, they cannot change. In fact, of all genres Fantasy is the most rigid and structurally conventional.

Stories do not materialize from a void but grow out of materials already in history and human experience.

The smaller the world, the more complete the knowledge of the writer, therefore the greater his creative choices. Result: a fully original story and victory in the war on cliché.

I suggest these specific methods: research of memory, research of imagination, research of fact. Generally, a story needs all three.

You may think you know, but you don’t know you know until you can write it down.

The result is his four basic genres: Simple Tragic, Simple Fortunate, Complex Tragic, Complex Fortunate.

Robert Frost said that writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down, for it’s the self-imposed, indeed artificial demands of poetic conventions that stir the imagination. Let’s say a poet arbitrarily imposes this limit: He decides to write in six-line stanzas, rhyming every other line. After rhyming the fourth line with the second line he reaches the end of a stanza. Backed into this corner, his struggle to rhyme the sixth line with the fourth and second may inspire him to imagine a word that has no relationship to his poem whatsoever—it just happens to rhyme—but this random word then springs loose a phrase that in turn brings an image to mind, an image that in turn resonates back through the first five lines, triggering a whole new sense and feeling, twisting and driving the poem to a richer meaning and emotion. Thanks to the poet’s Creative Limitation of this rhyme scheme, the poem achieves an intensity it would have lacked had the poet allowed himself the freedom to choose any word he wished.

In WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, the lovers suffer from the absurd belief that friendship and love are incompatible.

Hemingway, for example, was fascinated with the question of how to face death. After he witnessed the suicide of his father, it became the central theme, not only of his writing, but of his life. He chased death in war, in sport, on safari, until finally, putting a shotgun in his mouth, he found it.

Charles Dickens, whose father was imprisoned for debt, wrote of the lonely child searching for the lost father over and over in David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations.

Whatever your source of inspiration, beware of this: Long before you finish, the love of self will rot and die, the love of ideas sicken and perish. You’ll become so tired and bored with writing about yourself or your ideas, you may not finish the race.

What seems is not what is. People are not what they appear to be. A hidden nature waits concealed behind a facade of traits.

No matter what they say, no matter how they comport themselves, the only way we ever come to know characters in depth is through their choices under pressure.

“Movies are about their last twenty minutes.”.

Because in life idea and emotion come separately.

The source of all art is the human psyche’s primal, prelinguistic need for the resolution of stress and discord through beauty and harmony, for the use of creativity to revive a life deadened by routine, for a link to reality through our instinctive, sensory feel for the truth.

In life, experiences become meaningful with reflection in time. In art, they are meaningful now, at the instant they happen. In this sense, story is, at heart,.

In life, experiences become meaningful with reflection in time. In art, they are meaningful now, at the instant they happen.

CONTROLLING IDEA may be expressed in a single sentence describing how and why life undergoes change from one condition of existence at the beginning to another at the end.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence. Or you may think you’re a street-wise guy who’s been around the block a few times until you find yourself writing warm, compassionate endings.

You may think you’re a warm, loving human being until you find yourself writing tales of dark, cynical consequence. Or you may think you’re a street-wise guy who’s been around the block a few times until you find yourself writing warm, compassionate endings. You think you know who you are, but often you’re amazed by what’s skulking inside in need of expression.

The danger is this: When your Premise is an idea you feel you must prove to the world, and you design your story as an undeniable certification of that idea, you set yourself on the road to didacticism. In your zeal to persuade, you will stifle the voice of the other side. Misusing and abusing art to preach, your screenplay will become a thesis film, a thinly disguised sermon as you strive in a single stroke to convert the world.

Make no mistake, no one can achieve excellence as a writer without being something of a philosopher and holding strong convictions.

In 388 B.C. Plato urged the city fathers of Athens to exile all poets and storytellers. They are a threat to society, he argued. Writers deal with ideas, but not in the open, rational manner of philosophers. Instead, they conceal their ideas inside the seductive emotions of art. Yet felt ideas, as Plato pointed out, are ideas nonetheless. Every effective story sends a charged idea out to us, in effect compelling the idea into us, so that we must believe. In fact, the persuasive power of a story is so great that we may believe its meaning even if we find it morally repellent. Storytellers, Plato insisted, are dangerous people. He was right.

Hitler believed he would turn Europe into a paradise once he killed the people who needed killing… and he had his list.

No civilization, including Plato’s, has ever been destroyed because its citizens learned too much truth.

For just as glass is a medium for light, air a medium for sound, language is only a medium, one of many, in fact, for storytelling.

When you think about it, going to the movies is bizarre. Hundreds of strangers sit in a blackened room, elbow to elbow, for two or more hours. They don’t go to the toilet or get a smoke. Instead, they stare wide-eyed at a screen, investing more uninterrupted concentration than they give to work, paying money to suffer emotions they’d do anything to avoid in life. From this perspective, a second question arises: What is the source of story energy? How does it compel such intense mental and sentient attention from the audience? How do stories work?.

Other characters may be dogged, even inflexible, but the protagonist in particular is a willful being.

A story cannot be told about a protagonist who doesn’t want anything, who cannot make decisions, whose actions effect no change at any level.

If you could pull your protagonist aside, whisper in his ear, “What do you want?” he would have an answer: “I’d like X today, Y next week, but in the end I want Z.” The protagonist’s object of desire may be external: the destruction of the shark in JAWS, or internal: maturity in BIG.

The PROTAGONIST may also have a self-contradictory unconscious desire.

What he believes he wants is the antithesis of what he actually but unwittingly wants.

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,” that most people waste their precious time and die with the feeling they’ve fallen short of their dreams. As honest as this painful insight may be, we cannot allow ourselves to believe it. Instead, we carry hope to the end.

The audience wants to be taken to the limit, to where all questions are answered, all emotion satisfied—the end of the line.

The gift of story is the opportunity to live lives beyond our own, to desire and struggle in a myriad of worlds and times, at all the various depths of our being.

In story, we concentrate on that moment, and only that moment, in which a character takes an action expecting a useful reaction from his world, but instead the effect of his action is to provoke forces of antagonism. The world of the character reacts differently than expected, more powerfully than expected, or both.

It takes ten or more years of adult life to find something to say that tens of millions of people want to hear,.

You’re willing to risk people. Each morning you go to your desk and enter the imagined world of your characters. You dream and write until the sun’s setting and your head’s throbbing. So you turn off your word processor to be with the person you love. Except that, while you can turn off your machine, you can’t turn off your imagination. As you sit at dinner, your characters are still running through your head and you’re wishing there was a notepad next to your plate. Sooner or later, the person you love will say: “You know… you’re not really here.” Which is true. Half the time you’re somewhere else, and no one wants to live with somebody who isn’t really there.

The only reliable source of emotional truth is yourself. If you stay outside your characters, you inevitably write emotional clichés.

How to write a scene of insightful emotions? You could ask: How should someone take this action? But that leads to clichés and moralizing. Or you could ask: How might someone do this? But that leads to writing “cute”—clever but dishonest. Or: “If my character were in these circumstances, what would he do?” But that puts you at a distance, picturing your character walking the stage of his life, guessing at his emotions, and guesses are invariably clichés. Or you could ask: “If I were in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

You must doubt appearances and seek the opposite of the obvious.

Rather, peel back the skin of life to find the hidden, the unexpected, the seemingly inappropriate—in other words, the truth. And you will find your truth in the gap.

Writers are by instinct dialectical thinkers. As Jean Cocteau said, “The spirit of creation is the spirit of contradiction—the breakthrough of appearances toward an unknown reality.” You must doubt appearances and seek the opposite of the obvious. Don’t skim the surface, taking things at face value. Rather, peel back the skin of life to find the hidden, the unexpected, the seemingly inappropriate—in other words, the truth. And you will find your truth in the gap.

Consequently, fine writing puts less stress on what happens than on to whom it happens and why and how it happens.

Anything that can be given a free will and the capacity to desire, take action, and suffer the consequences can be a protagonist.

The PROTAGONIST has the will and capacity to pursue the object of his conscious and/or unconscious desire to the end of the line, to the human limit established by setting and genre.

The audience, therefore, expects the storyteller to be an artist of vision who can take his story to those distant depths and ranges.

“This character is like me. Therefore, I want him to have whatever it is he wants, because if I were he in those circumstances, I’d want the same thing for myself.”.

The audience identifies with deep character, with innate qualities revealed through choice under pressure.

Human beings. As the filmgoer looks up on the screen, he recognizes the character’s humanity, senses that he shares it, identifies with the protagonist, and dives into the story. Indeed, in the hands of the greatest writers, even the most unsympathetic character can be made empathetic. Macbeth,.

Macbeth, for example, viewed objectively, is monstrous. He butchers a kindly old King while the man is sleeping, a King who had never done Macbeth any harm—in fact, that very day he’d given Macbeth a royal promotion. Macbeth then murders two servants of the King to blame the deed on them. He kills his best friend. Finally he orders the assassination of the wife and infant children of his enemy. He’s a ruthless killer; yet, in Shakespeare’s hands he becomes a tragic, empathetic hero. The Bard accomplished this feat by giving Macbeth a conscience. As he wanders in soliloquy, wondering, agonizing, “Why am I doing this? What kind of a man am I?” the audience listens and thinks, “What kind? Guilt-ridden… just like me. I feel bad when I’m thinking about doing bad things. I feel awful when I do them and afterward there’s no end to the guilt. Macbeth is a human being; he has a conscience just like mine.” In fact, we’re so drawn to Macbeth’s writhing soul, we feel a tragic loss when at climax Macduff decapitates him. Macbeth is a breathtaking display of the godlike power of the writer to find an empathetic center in an otherwise contemptible character.

So the closest circle of antagonism in the world of a character is his own being: feelings and emotions, mind and body, all or any of which may or may not react from one moment to the next the way he expects.

Not until we set the conventional role aside do we find the true intimacy of family, friends, and lovers—who then do not react the way we expect and become the second level of personal conflict.

We all walk this earth thinking, or at least hoping, that we understand ourselves, our intimates, society, and the world.

But this is a truth we cannot know absolutely. It’s what we believe to be true.

As in life, so in fiction. When objective necessity contradicts a character’s sense of probability, a gap suddenly cracks open in the fictional reality. This gap is the point where the subjective and objective realms collide, the difference between anticipation and result, between the world as the character perceived it before acting and the truth he discovers in action.

Life teaches that the measure of the value of any human desire is in direct proportion to the risk involved in its pursuit.

For we not only create stories as metaphors for life, we create them as metaphors for meaningful life—and to live meaningfully is to be at perpetual risk.

The measure of the value of a character’s desire is in direct proportion to the risk he’s willing to take to achieve it; the greater the value, the greater the risk.

How, as you sit at your desk, do you crawl inside the head of your character to feel your heart pounding, your palms sweating, a knot in your belly, tears in your eyes, laughter in your heart, sexual arousal, anger, outrage, compassion, sadness, joy, or any of the uncountable responses along the spectrum of human emotions?.

You ask: “If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

How to write a scene of insightful emotions? You could ask: How should someone take this action? But that leads to clichés and moralizing. Or you could ask: How might someone do this? But that leads to writing “cute”—clever but dishonest. Or: “If my character were in these circumstances, what would he do?” But that puts you at a distance, picturing your character walking the stage of his life, guessing at his emotions, and guesses are invariably clichés. Or you could ask: “If I were in these circumstances, what would I do?” As this question plays on your imagination, it may start your heart pounding, but obviously you’re not the character. Although it may be an honest emotion for you, your character might do the reverse. So what do you do? You ask: “If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

“If I were this character in these circumstances, what would I do?”.

The substance of story is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen; the rift between expectation and result, probability and necessity. To build a scene, we constantly break open these breaches in reality.

The substance of story is the gap that splits open between what a human being expects to happen when he takes an action and what really does happen; the rift between expectation and result, probability and necessity. To build a scene, we constantly break open these breaches in reality. As to the source of energy in story, the answer is the same: the gap. The audience empathizes with the character, vicariously seeking his desire. It more or less expects the world to react the way the character expects. When the gap opens up for character, it opens up for audience. This is the “Oh, my God!” moment, the “Oh, no!” or “Oh, yes!” you’ve experienced again and again in well-crafted stories.

We’ve defined setting in terms of period,.

We’ve defined setting in terms of period, duration, location, and level of conflict.

“He who confesses first loses.” The first person to say “I love you” has lost because the other, upon hearing it, immediately smiles a knowing smile, realizing that he’s the one loved, so he now controls the relationship. If you’re lucky, those three little words will be said in unison over candlelight. Or, if very, very lucky, they won’t need to be said… they’ll be done.

If two characters in your cast share the same attitude and react in kind to whatever occurs, you must either collapse the two into one, or expel one from the story. When characters react the same, you minimize opportunities for conflict. Instead, the writer’s strategy must be to maximize these opportunities.

If we both share the same views, then one of us can be let go of the story.

If, on the other hand, we notice that she’s created an ingenious kitchen wallpaper from hundreds of parking tickets, then a sudden POUNDING on the door brings the police, brandishing a felony warrant for ten thousand dollars in unpaid citations, and she flees down the fire escape, heading West—this could be an Inciting Incident. It has done what an Inciting Incident must do.

The INCITING INCIDENT radically upsets the balance of forces in the protagonist’s life.

But for those protagonists we tend to admire the most, the Inciting Incident arouses not only a conscious desire, but an unconscious one as well. These complex characters suffer intense inner battles because these two desires are in direct conflict with each other. No matter what the character consciously thinks he wants, the audience senses or realizes that deep inside he unconsciously wants the very opposite.

He thinks he’s hunting for the perfect woman, but we know that unconsciously he wants to degrade and destroy women and has done that throughout his life.

Fergus harbors the most human of needs: to love and be loved.

If, on the other hand, the protagonist has an unconscious desire, this becomes the Spine of the story. An unconscious desire is always more powerful and durable, with roots reaching to the protagonist’s innermost self. When an unconscious desire drives the story, it allows the writer to create a far more complex character who may repeatedly change his conscious desire.

For better or worse, an event throws a character’s life out of balance, arousing in him the conscious and/or unconscious desire for that which he feels will restore balance, launching him on a Quest for his Object of Desire against forces of antagonism (inner, personal, extra-personal). He may or may not achieve it. This is story in a nutshell.

The essential form of story is simple. But that’s like saying that the essential form of music is simple. It is. It’s twelve notes. But these twelve notes conspire into everything and anything we have ever called music.

The essential form of story is simple. But that’s like saying that the essential form of music is simple. It is. It’s twelve notes. But these twelve notes conspire into everything and anything we have ever called music. The essential elements of the Quest are the twelve notes of our music, the melody we’ve listened to all our lives. However, like the composer sitting down at the piano, when a writer takes up this seemingly simple form, he discovers how incredibly complex it is, how inordinately difficult to do.

The scene is called “obligatory” because having teased the audience into anticipating this moment, the writer is obligated to keep his promise and show it to them.

The primary component of foreshadowing, however, is the projection of the Obligatory Scene (Crisis) into the audience’s imaginaton by the Inciting Incident.

A story must not retreat to actions of lesser quality or magnitude, but move progressively forward to a final action beyond which the audience cannot imagine another.

The only way to keep a film’s current flowing and rising is research—imagination, memory, fact.

To create forty to sixty scenes and not repeat yourself, you need to invent hundreds.

Nothing moves forward in a story except through conflict.

Put another way, conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music.

Put another way, conflict is to storytelling what sound is to music. Both story and music are temporal arts, and the single most difficult task of the temporal artist is to hook our interest, hold our uninterrupted concentration, then carry us through time without an awareness of the passage of time.

As Jean-Paul Sartre expressed it, the essence of reality is scarcity, a universal and eternal lacking.

Time, as Heidegger observed, is the basic category of existence. We live in its ever-shrinking shadow, and if we are to achieve anything in our brief being that lets us die without feeling we’ve wasted our time, we will have to go into heady conflict with the forces of scarcity that deny our desires.

Their scripts fail for one of two reasons: either a glut of meaningless and absurdly violent conflict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed conflict.

The latter are tedious portraits written in reaction against conflict itself. These writers take the Pollyanna view that life would really be nice… if it weren’t for conflict. Therefore, their films avoid it in favor of low-key depictions to suggest that if we learned to communicate a little better, be a little more charitable, respect the environment, humanity could return to paradise. But if history has taught us anything, it’s that when toxic nightmare is finally cleaned up, the homeless provided shelter, and the world converted to solar energy, each of us will still be up to our eyebrows in mulch.

Writers at these extremes fail to realize that while the quality of conflict changes as it shifts from level to level, the quantity of conflict in life is constant. Something is always lacking. Like squeezing a balloon, the volume of conflict never changes, it just bulges in another direction. When we remove conflict from one level of life, it amplifies ten times over on another level.

Boredom is the inner conflict we suffer when we lose desire, when we lack a lacking.

Once housed, dressed, fed, and medicated, we take a breath and realize how incomplete we are as human beings.

Once housed, dressed, fed, and medicated, we take a breath and realize how incomplete we are as human beings. We want more than physical comfort, we want, of all things, happiness, and so begin the wars of the inner life.

Death is like a freight train in the future, heading toward us, closing the hours, second by second, between now and then.

Life is about the ultimate questions of finding love and self-worth, of bringing serenity to inner chaos, of the titanic social inequities everywhere around us, of time running out. Life is conflict. That is its nature. The writer must decide where and how to orchestrate this struggle.

“Love cuts two ways: we possess it when we give it freedom, but destroy it with possessiveness.”.

Love is a strange thing, it can only be possessed by surrendering possessiveness.

All parents can do is love their children, support them, pick them up when they fall. But there’s no such thing as winning this game.

A novelist can enter a character’s mind and in first- or third-person delineate inner conflict directly in prose description.

A writer secure in his talent knows there’s no limit to what he can create, and so he trashes everything less than his best on a quest for a gem-quality story.

“With enthusiasm” doesn’t mean people leap up and kiss you on both cheeks, rather they whisper “Wow” and fall silent. A fine work of art—music, dance, painting, story—has the power to silence the chatter in the mind and lift us to another place. When a story, pitched from a step-outline, is so strong it brings silence—no comments, no criticism, just a look of pleasure—that’s a hell of a thing and time is too precious to waste on a story that hasn’t that power. Now the writer’s ready to move to the next stage—the treatment.

We may think we know what our characters are thinking and feeling, but we don’t know we know until we write it down:.

“Tell me something I don’t know.”.

To tell story is to make a promise: If you give me your concentration, I’ll give you surprise followed by the pleasure of discovering life, its pains and joys, at levels and in directions you have never imagined. And most important, this must be done with such seeming ease and naturalness that we lead the audience to these discoveries as if spontaneously. The effect of a beautifully turned moment is that filmgoers experience a rush of knowledge as if they did it for themselves.

Insight is the audience’s reward for paying attention, and a beautifully designed story delivers this pleasure scene after scene after scene.

Here the writer opens his arms to the world, saying: “This is my vision of life, of the nature of the human beings that inhabit my world. This is what I think happens to people in these circumstances for these reasons. My ideas, my emotions. Me.” Our most powerful means of self-expression is the unique way we turn the story.

This is why weak storytelling resorts to substituting information for insight.

Language is a tool for self-expression and must never become a decorative end of its own.

To set up means to layer in knowledge; to pay off means to close the gap by delivering that knowledge to the audience.

Prison compound and discovers a makeshift.

Life, is just a makeshift.

Makeshift.

Turning Points fail when we overprepare the obvious and underprepare the unusual.

Bergman, for example, is difficult for the young—not because they couldn’t grasp his ideas if they were explained, but because Bergman never explains.

Once the setup closes the gap, that payoff will, in all probability, become yet another setup for payoffs ahead.

The understanding of how we create the audience’s emotional experience begins with the realization that there are only two emotions—pleasure and pain. Each has its variations: joy, love, happiness, rapture, fun, ecstasy, thrill, bliss, and many others on one hand, and anguish, dread, anxiety, terror, grief, humiliation, malaise, misery, stress, remorse, and many others on the other hand. But at heart life gives us only one or the other.

If we do not understand that much about human nature—that a human being is only capable of acting toward the right or the good as he has come to believe it or rationalize it—then we understand very little. Good/evil, right/wrong choices are dramatically obvious and trivial.

True choice is dilemma. It occurs in two situations. First, a choice between irreconcilable goods: From the character’s view two things are desirable, he wants both, but circumstances are forcing him to choose only one. Second, a choice between the lesser of two evils: From the character’s view two things are undesirable, he wants neither, but circumstances are forcing him to choose one. How a character chooses in a true dilemma is a powerful expression of his humanity and of the world in which he lives. Writers.

“She’ll come back. She always did.”.

“I stick my neck out for no man.”.

A story, even when expressing chaos, must be unified. This sentence, drawn from any plot, should be logical: “Because of the Inciting Incident, the Climax had to happen.”.

The Inciting Incident is the story’s most profound cause, and, therefore, the final effect, the Story Climax, should seem inevitable.

The cement that binds them is the Spine, the protagonist’s deep desire to restore the balance of life.

CASABLANCA, for example, is not only one of the most loved films of all time, it’s also one of the most various. It’s a brilliant Love Story, but more than half the film is Political Drama. Its excellent action sequences are counter-pointed by urbane comedy. And it’s the next thing to a Musical. Over a dozen tunes, strategically placed throughout, comment on or set up event, meaning, emotion.

Instead, we seek the tragic in the comic, the political in the personal, the personal driving the political, the extraordinary behind the usual, the trivial in the exalted.

This rhythm beats between two contradictory desires: On one hand, we desire serenity, harmony, peace, and relaxation, but too much of this day after day and we become bored to the point of ennui and need therapy.

This rhythm beats between two contradictory desires: On one hand, we desire serenity, harmony, peace, and relaxation, but too much of this day after day and we become bored to the point of ennui and need therapy. As a result, we also desire challenge, tension, danger, even fear. But too much of this day after day and again we end up in the rubber room. So the rhythm of life swings between these poles.

We moan about traffic but never do anything about it because, in truth, we secretly enjoy rush hour; drive-time is the only time most of us are ever alone. You relax, scratch what needs scratching, and add a primal scream to the music.

You escape into your car, snap on the radio, and get in the proper lane according to the music. If classical, you hug the right; if pop, down the middle of the road; if rock, head left. We moan about traffic but never do anything about it because, in truth, we secretly enjoy rush hour; drive-time is the only time most of us are ever alone. You relax, scratch what needs scratching, and add a primal scream to the music.

As Andre (Andre Gregory) relates his quixotic adventure toward spiritual development, he so cants his friend’s view of life that Wally (Wallace Shawn) leaves.

This is why we tend to tell stories about lawyers, doctors, warriors, politicians, scientists—people so positioned in society by profession that if something goes haywire in their private lives, the writer can expand the action into society.

This principle of starting with intimate problems that ramify outward into the world to build powerful progressions explains why certain professions are overrepresented in the roles of protagonists. This is why we tend to tell stories about lawyers, doctors, warriors, politicians, scientists—people so positioned in society by profession that if something goes haywire in their private lives, the writer can expand the action into society.

Imagine a story that begins like this: The President of the United States gets up one morning to shave and as he stares in the mirror, he hallucinates about imaginary enemies around the globe. He tells no one, but soon his wife realizes he’s gone mad. His close associates too. They gather and decide that since he has only six months left in office, why spoil things now? They’ll cover up for him. But we know he has “his finger on the button” and a madman in this position could turn our troubled world into universal hell.

If the logic of your setting doesn’t allow you to go wide, then you must go deep.

If the logic of your setting doesn’t allow you to go wide, then you must go deep. Start with a personal or inner conflict that demands balancing, yet seems relatively solvable. Then, as the work progresses, hammer the story downward—emotionally, psychologically, physically, morally—to the dark secrets, the unspoken truths that hide behind a public mask.

ORDINARY PEOPLE is confined to the family, a friend, and a doctor. From a tension between mother and son that seems solvable with communication and love, it descends to grievous pain. As the father slowly comes to realize he must choose between the sanity of his son and the unity of his family, the story drives the child to the brink of suicide, the mother to reveal her hatred of her own child, and the husband to lose a wife he deeply loves.

A good story well told fosters a good film. But a good story well told with the added power of subliminal symbolism lifts the telling to the next level of expressivity, and the payoff may be a great film.

We save our own humanity when we stop killing other living beings.

If the hunter spills enough blood, sooner or later he runs out of targets and turns the gun on himself.

He either literally kills himself, as does Nick (Christopher Walken), or more likely, he kills himself in the sense that he stops feeling anything and falls dead inside.

An archetypal image: hunter and prey at the top of a mountain. Why the top of a mountain? Because tops of mountains are places where “great things happen.”.

“Ah, life is just like that.” It.

“Ah, life is just like that.” It sees life in duality; it plays with our paradoxical existence, aware of the bottomless chasm between what seems and what is.

Susan’s persistence pays off as she transforms David from fossilized child to life-embracing adult.

If I could send a telegram to the film producers of the world, it would be these three words: “Meaning Produces Emotion.”.

A revolution in values from positive to negative or negative to positive with or without irony—a value swing at maximum charge that’s absolute and irreversible. The meaning of that change moves the heart of the audience.

The flow of life moves from cause to effect, but the flow of creativity often flows from effect to cause.

The key to all story endings is to give the audience what it wants, but not the way it expects.

But if we were to look closely, we’d discover that they not only avoid negative emotions in movies, they avoid them in life.

In fact, down-ending films are often huge commercial successes: DANGEROUS LIAISONS, eighty million dollars; THE WAR OF THE ROSES, one hundred fifty million; THE ENGLISH PATIENT, two hundred twenty-five million. No one can count THE GODFATHER, PART II’s money.

Michael forgives Fredo, quits the mob, and moves to Boston with his family to sell insurance? The Climax of this magnificent film is truthful, beautiful, and very satisfying.

Anyone can deliver a happy ending—just give the characters everything they want. Or a downer—just kill everybody. An artist gives us the emotion he’s promised… but with a rush of unexpected insight that he’s withheld to a Turning Point within the Climax itself.

Anyone can deliver a happy ending—just give the characters everything they want. Or a downer—just kill everybody. An artist gives us the emotion he’s promised… but with a rush of unexpected insight that he’s withheld to a Turning Point within the Climax itself. So that as the protagonist improvises his final effort, he may or may not achieve his desire, but the flood of insight that pours from the gap delivers the hoped-for emotion but in a way we could never have foreseen.

The story’s emotional heart is in the main plot.

The audience, however, has come to know many supporting roles whose lives will be changed by the climactic action.

A film needs what the theatre calls a “slow curtain.” A line of description at the bottom of the last page that sends the camera slowly back or tracking along images for a few seconds, so the audience can catch its breath, gather its thoughts, and leave the cinema with dignity.

The first draft of anything is shit. — ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

(I don’t have nothing never!).

The Contradictory, however, is not the limit of human experience. At the end of the line waits the Negation of the Negation, a force of antagonism that’s doubly negative.

Our subject is life, not arithmetic. In life two negatives don’t make a positive. In English double negatives are ungrammatical, but Italian uses double and even triple negatives so that a statement feels like its meaning. In anguish an Italian might say, “Non ho niente mia!” (I don’t have nothing never!). Italians know life.

Chile is in the grip of tyranny. The generals can make illegal on Tuesday what you did legally on Monday, arrest you for it on Wednesday, execute you on Thursday, and make it legal again Friday morning.

Although Horman couldn’t indict the tyrants in Chile, he exposed them onscreen in front of the world—which may be a sweeter kind of justice.

To hate other people is bad enough, but even a misanthrope loves one person. When self-love vanishes and a character loathes his own being, he reaches the Negation of the Negation and existence becomes a living hell: Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

Many parents hate their children, many children hate their parents, and they fight and scream and say it. In these fine films, although a parent bitterly resents and secretly hates his or her child, they pretend to love him. When the antagonist adds that lie, the story moves to the Negation of the Negation. How can a child defend himself against that?.

The first form of hatred is masquerading as love.

For if we reveal too much too soon, the audience will see the climaxes coming long before they arrive.

Reveal only that exposition the audience absolutely needs and wants to know and no more.

Put the question “Why?” in the filmgoer’s mind. “Why is this character behaving this way? Why doesn’t this or that happen? Why?” With a hunger for information, even the most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.

They stand to lose what they have in their struggle to achieve a rebalancing of existence.

If you can thoroughly dramatize exposition and make it invisible, if you can control its disclosure, parsing it out only when and if the audience needs and wants to know it, saving the best for last, you’re learning your craft. But what’s a problem for beginning writers becomes an invaluable asset to those who know the craft. Rather than avoiding exposition by giving their characters an anonymous past, they go out of their way to salt their biographies with significant events. Because what is the challenge that the storyteller faces dozens of times over in the telling? How to turn the scene. How to create Turning Points.

We can turn scenes only one of two ways: on action or on revelation. There are no other means.

Powerful revelations come from the BACKSTORY—previous significant events in the lives of the characters that the writer can reveal at critical moments to create Turning Points.

Agatha Christie, however, opens her stories with only the second half—a closet door opens and a body falls out. By starting with the discovery of the crime, she arouses curiosity in two directions: Into the past, how and why was the murder committed? Into the future, which of the many suspects did it? Tarantino’s.

The Inciting Incident of a Murder Mystery combines two events: A murder is committed; the protagonist discovers the crime. Agatha Christie, however, opens her stories with only the second half—a closet door opens and a body falls out. By starting with the discovery of the crime, she arouses curiosity in two directions: Into the past, how and why was the murder committed? Into the future, which of the many suspects did it?.

Second, do not bring in a flashback until you have created in the audience the need and desire to know.

The prose writer can, if he wishes, walk a character past a shop window, have him look inside and remember his entire childhood: “He was walking through his hometown that afternoon when he glanced over at the barbershop and remembered the days when his father would take him there as a boy and he’d sit among the old-timers as they smoked cigars and talked about baseball. It was there that he first heard the word ‘sex’ and ever since he’s unable to sleep with a woman without thinking he was hitting a home run.”.

To study the skillful design of exposition, I suggest a close analysis of JFK. Obtain Oliver Stone’s screenplay and/or the video and break the film down, scene by scene, listing all the facts, indisputable or alleged, it contains. Then note how Stone splintered this Mount Everest of information into its vital pieces, dramatized each bit, pacing the progression of revelations. It is a masterpiece of craftsmanship.

We may make the audience cry or laugh, but above all, as Charles Reade noted, we make it wait.

Mafia logic runs like this: “People want prostitution, narcotics, and illicit gambling. When they’re in trouble, they want to bribe police and judges. They want to taste the fruits of crime, but they’re lying hypocrites and won’t admit it. We provide these services but we’re not hypocrites. We deal in realities. We are the ‘good’ people.” Mr. Coney Island was a conscienceless assassin, but inside he was convinced he was good.

The loyalty of the Godfather’s family makes them the good bad guys. When we spot this positive quality, our emotions move toward it and we find ourselves in empathy with gangsters.

THE GODFATHER: Not only is the Corleone family corrupt, but so too are the other mafia families, even the police and judges. Everyone in this film is a criminal or related to one. But the Corleones have one positive quality—loyalty. In other mob clans gangsters stab one another in the back. That makes them the bad bad guys. The loyalty of the Godfather’s family makes them the good bad guys. When we spot this positive quality, our emotions move toward it and we find ourselves in empathy with gangsters.

This moral management draws the audience into empathy, feeling, “If I had to lead a life of crime, I’d want to be like Cody Jarrett.”.

In Dramatic Irony the audience knows more than the characters.

“Don’t worry, folks, if you stick with me through this boring stretch, I’ll eventually get back to the exciting stuff.”.

“Please, let it be good. Let it give me an experience I’ve never had, insights into a fresh truth. Let me laugh at something I’ve never thought funny. Let me be moved by something that’s never touched me before. Let me see the world in a new way. Amen.”.

“To be about to act and not to act is the worst. It is shocking without being tragic.”.

We all hurt people inadvertently but instantly regret it. But when someone purposely seeks to cause pain in others and takes pleasure from it, that’s evil.

Therefore, the first principle of adaptation: The purer the novel, the purer the play, the worse the film. “Literary purity” does.

Therefore, the first principle of adaptation: The purer the novel, the purer the play, the worse the film.

As William Faulkner observed, human nature is the only subject that doesn’t date.

We know characters better than we know our friends because a character is eternal and unchanging, while people shift—just when we think we understand them, we don’t.

We know characters better than we know our friends because a character is eternal and unchanging, while people shift—just when we think we understand them, we don’t. In fact, I know Rick Blaine in CASABLANCA better than I know myself. Rick is always Rick. I’m a bit iffy.

TRUE CHARACTER can only be expressed through choice in dilemma. How the person chooses to act under pressure is who he is—the greater the pressure, the truer and deeper the choice to character.

The key to True Character is desire. In life, if we feel stifled, the fastest way to get unstuck is to ask, “What do I want?,” listen to the honest answer, then find the will to pursue that desire. Problems still remain, but now we’re in motion with the chance of solving them.

Behind desire is motivation. Why does your character want what he wants? You have your ideas about motive, but don’t be surprised if others see it differently. A friend may feel that parental upbringing shaped your character’s desires; someone else may think it’s our materialist culture; another may blame the school system; yet another may claim it’s in the genes; still another thinks he’s possessed by the devil. Contemporary attitudes tend to favor mono-explanations for behavior, rather than the complexity of forces that’s more likely the case.

Generally, the more the writer nails motivation to specific causes, the more he diminishes the character in the audience’s mind.

Placing a conventional personality against an exotic background, or a strange, mysterious individual within an ordinary, down-to-earth society immediately generates interest.

Don’t cause false anticipation by making bit parts more interesting than necessary.

But that’s okay because conversation isn’t about making points or achieving closure. It’s what psychologists call “keeping the channel open.” Talk is how we develop and change relationships.

When two friends meet on the street and talk about the weather, don’t we know that theirs isn’t a conversation about the weather? What is being said? “I’m your friend. Let’s take a minute out of our busy day and stand here in each other’s presence and reaffirm that we are indeed friends.”.

What is said and done is not what is thought and felt.

First, screen dialogue requires compression and economy. Screen dialogue must say the maximum in the fewest possible words. Second, it must have direction. Each exchange of dialogue must turn the beats of the scene in one direction or another across the changing behaviors, without repetition. Third, it should have purpose. Each line or exchange of dialogue executes a step in design that builds and arcs a scene around its Turning Point. All this precision, yet it must sound like talk, using an informal and natural vocabulary, complete with contractions, slang, and even, if necessary, profanity. “Speak as common people do,” Aristotle advised, “but think as wise men do.”.

Here’s what Bergman gave us: The waiter walks to the table and accidentally on purpose drops the napkin on the floor. As he bends to pick it up, he slowly sniffs and smells Anna from head to crotch to foot. She, in reaction, draws a long, slow, almost delirious breath. CUT TO: They’re in a hotel room. Perfect, isn’t it? Erotic, purely visual, not a word said or necessary. That’s screenwriting.

The same applies to verbs. A typical line of nondescription: “He starts to move slowly across the room.” How does somebody “start” across a room on film? The character either crosses or takes a step and stops. And “move slowly”? “Slowly” is an adverb; “move” a vague, bland verb. Instead, name the action: “He pads across the room.” “He (ambles, strolls, moseys, saunters, drags himself, staggers, waltzes, glides, lumbers, tiptoes, creeps, slouches, shuffles, waddles, minces, trudges, teeters, lurches, gropes, hobbles) across the room.”.

Not “The carpenter uses a big nail,” but “The carpenter hammers a spike.” “Nail” is a generic noun, “big” an adjective. The solid, Anglo-Saxon “spike” pops a vivid image in the reader’s mind, “nail” a blur. How big?.

Eliminate “is” and “are” throughout. Onscreen nothing is in a state of being; story life is an unending flux of change, of becoming. Not: “There is a big house on a hill above a small town.” “There is,” “They are,” “It is,” “He/She is” are the weakest possible ways into any English sentence. And what’s a “big house”? Chateau? Hacienda? A “hill”? Ridge? Bluff? A “small town”? Crossroads? Hamlet? Perhaps: “A mansion guards the headlands above the village.” With a Hemingwayesque shunning of Latinate and abstrate terms, of adjectives and adverbs, in favor of the most specific, active verbs and concrete nouns possible, even establishing shots come alive. Fine film description requires an imagination and a vocabulary.

“The sun sets like a tiger’s eye closing in the jungle,” and,.

They are director traps, seductive but unphotographable.

“You guessed it. Here comes the sex scene. I’d write it, but my mother reads these things.”.

“History is the symptom, we are the disease.”.

A struggling writer may at times produce quality, but from day to day he cannot make his talent perform when and as he wants, doesn’t progress in quality from story to story, and receives little, if any, income from his efforts.

If, hypothetically and optimistically, a screenplay can be written from first idea to last draft in six months, these writers typically spend the first four of those six months writing on stacks of three-by-five cards: a stack for each act—three, four, perhaps more. On these cards they create the story’s step-outline.

This process, however, doesn’t mean the writer isn’t filling pages. Day after day a huge stack grows on the side of the desk: but these are biographies, the fictional world and its history, thematic notations, images, even snippets of vocabulary and idiom.

This process, however, doesn’t mean the writer isn’t filling pages. Day after day a huge stack grows on the side of the desk: but these are biographies, the fictional world and its history, thematic notations, images, even snippets of vocabulary and idiom. Research and imaginings of all kinds fill a file cabinet while the story is disciplined to the step-outline.

Everything that’s wrong with it in a ten-minute pitch is ten times worse onscreen.

They don’t all sound like one another and they don’t all sound like the writer.

But in their secret selves they know they’re just taking talent for a walk.

High above the forest floor, a millipede strolled along the branch of a tree, her thousand pairs of legs swinging in an easy gait. From the tree top, song birds looked down, fascinated by the synchronization of the millipede’s stride. “That’s an amazing talent,” chirped the songbirds. “You have more limbs than we can count. How do you do it?” And for the first time in her life the millipede thought about this. “Yes,” she wondered, “how do I do what I do?” As she turned to look back, her bristling legs suddenly ran into one another and tangled like vines of ivy. The songbirds laughed as the millipede, in a panic of confusion, twisted herself into a knot and fell to the earth below.

On the forest floor, the millipede, realizing that only her pride was hurt, slowly, carefully, limb by limb, unraveled herself. With patience and hard work, she studied and flexed and tested her appendages, until she was able to stand and walk. What was once instinct became knowledge. She realized she didn’t have to move at her old, slow, rote pace. She could amble, strut, prance, even run and jump. Then, as never before, she listened to the symphony of the songbirds and let music touch her heart. Now in perfect command of thousands of talented legs, she gathered courage and, with a style of her own, danced and danced a dazzling dance that astonished all the creatures of her world.

Anticipate. The effect is to crack open the gap between expectation and result, turning his outer fortunes, inner life, or both from the positive to the negative or the negative to the positive in terms of values the audience understands are at risk.

Superman is not his powers. Superman is his weaknesses.

The Lord of the Rings is not, when you boil it down, about Gandalf’s magical powers or even Aragorn’s orc-slaying skills. It’s about the Hobbits, arguably the weakest (physically and magically) of the people in the books. It’s about Aragorn’s struggle to become king.

# A Manual for Heartache (Cathy Rentzenbrink)

Perhaps heartbreak is what happens on impact, and heartache is what we are left with as time passes, once the dust settles, when we are able to look up and around us but are still shrouded in sadness.

There were times in my past when I didn’t want to be alive. I thought my heart couldn’t bear the pain of the world and might one day just refuse to beat.

I thought I knew what my life was going to be like and now I don’t.’.

We try to impose a hierarchy on pain is really unhelpful for people who are suffering,.

I told them about Maya Angelou, how she said that there is no greater agony than carrying around an untold story.

We worry that if people knew what we were really like, they’d run away.

It’s too easy to let fear of saying the wrong thing lead to not saying anything at all.

People in distress may well take offence easily because they cannot be pleased. Our main duty is to let them and not take offence back.

If there is ever a time to seek meaning in tragedy – and I’m not sure there is – it certainly isn’t in the immediate aftermath.

Perhaps we need to accept that we don’t have the power to fix anyone, but could just be there for them with love.

When Matty and I were little and were trying to figure out the meaning of love, we decided that it meant you’d cry if someone died. And maybe that is it. I loved him, he died, and for years, I cried.

I used to be frightened of loving people because I thought I wouldn’t survive losing them, but now I see that making friends with grief, accepting it as part of being human, will liberate me to love even more, and that the love is always worth it.

As I watched myself on the screen say that reading was my only solace during dark times, that I found books easier to deal with than life, I realized that anyone with any knowledge of depression would know what I was talking about.

We don’t want to embarrass people or make them feel worried or miserable, so we create a version of ourselves that we think they will want to see.

The mind is simply another part of the body. It works hard, deserves our care and we shouldn’t feel ashamed about needing to give it some attention.

I rather like being disagreed with in real life – I don’t think I’m always right and enjoy having my ideas tested – but I can’t cope with it online. I’m not sure why it feels so brutal. Perhaps it’s the absence of eye contact, or the spectre of an unseen audience, but I find it anxiety-inducing.

No matter what happens, we always have dominion over ourselves.

A boggart is a monster that assumes the shape of the thing you fear most.

It’s quite something to realize that you can have power and influence over your own thoughts and moods. This is so important, as the terror of depression is that it might descend unbidden at any moment.

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows you nothing more nor less than your heart’s desire. The happiest person in the world, Dumbledore explains, would see only themselves, as they are.

What I’ve come to see is not that things happen for a reason, but that there is some sort of trick whereby you can look at your mangled wreckage and from it craft meaning and purpose.

‘So shines a good deed in a naughty world.’.

Josephine Hart, in her novel of that name, suggests that damaged people are dangerous because they know they will survive.

A lot of growing up is about learning to hide how you are feeling so you can protect yourself, and then a lot about being really grown-up is unpicking all those defensive measures and working out who you actually want to be. But for now . . . Kids.

A lot of growing up is about learning to hide how you are feeling so you can protect yourself, and then a lot about being really grown-up is unpicking all those defensive measures and working out who you actually want to be.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it is.

‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’.

When I can’t decide whether or not to do something, I ask myself what I will wish I’d done at the end of my long life.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time. I will.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time.

It is, we know, better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.


# The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams)

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

This is not her story.

First, it is slightly cheaper; and second, it has the words DON’T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.

The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.

Ford Prefect usually played to lose.

He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.

What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn’t matter a pair of dingo’s kidneys whether Arthur’s house got knocked down or not now.

“Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.”.

“Very deep,” said Arthur, “you should send that in to the Reader’s Digest. They’ve got a page for people like you.” “Drink up.”.

“Drink up,” said Ford, “you’ve got three pints to get through.” “Three pints?” said Arthur. “At lunchtime?” The man next to Ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, “Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.” “Very deep,” said Arthur, “you should send that in to the Reader’s Digest. They’ve got a page for people like you.” “Drink up.”.

“Did I do anything wrong today,” he said, “or has the world always been like this and I’ve been too wrapped up in myself to notice?”.

He knew where his towel was.

(a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the color blue).

Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.

Emperor—an elected governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly.

His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it.

One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in It’s a nice day, or You’re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you all right? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behavior. If human beings don’t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.

After a few months’ consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one. If they don’t keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.

After a few months’ consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one. If they don’t keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried abut the terrible number of things they didn’t know about.

“Ah,” said Arthur, “this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn’t previously aware of.”.

Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy.

“Charming man,” he said. “I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one …”.

“Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a fina and clinching proof of the nonexistence of God. “The argument goes something like this: ‘I refuse to prove that I exist,’ says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.’ “‘But,’ says Man, ‘the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn’t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don’t. QED.’.

“I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or …” he paused for melodramatic effect, “tell me how good you thought my poem was!”.

“So what you’re saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved,” he said. He paused, “Is that right?”.

“I don’t want to die now!” he yelled. “I’ve still got a headache! I don’t want to go to heaven with a headache, I’d be all cross and wouldn’t enjoy it!”.

“Death’s too good for them,” he said.

(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete while on the planet is surgically removed from your body weight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory there it is vitally important to get a receipt.).

Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars.

“Ford!” he said, “there’s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they’ve worked out.”.

Many respectable physicists said that they weren’t going to stand for this, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn’t get invited to those sorts of parties.

It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute’s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn’t stand was a smart-ass.

Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did.

“‘All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.’”.

One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn’t be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn’t understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so—but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He preferred people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it.

“Funny,” he intoned funereally, “how just when you think life can’t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.”.

Either the climate wasn’t quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

What do I mean by who am I?.

“But what are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?” “You think you’ve got problems,” said Marvin, as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, “what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don’t bother to answer that, I’m fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don’t know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.”.

Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it.

It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.

There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches?.

Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don’t get up and go to work?.

“Maybe. Who cares?” said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. “Perhaps I’m old and tired,” he continued, “but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.”.

“You know,” said Arthur thoughtfully, “all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I’ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was.” “No,” said the old man, “that’s just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that.” “Everyone?” said Arthur. “Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know …” “Maybe. Who cares?” said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. “Perhaps I’m old and tired,” he continued, “but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.”.

“The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.

“For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?”.


# Modern Love (Unknown)

Vulnerability is the animating quality of all love stories, and it can take many forms.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery. Desire makes one feel vulnerable, which then requires one to be brave.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery. Or a lot.

“We get so fixated on the job we want or the person we’re dating because we don’t think there will be another. But there’s always another.”.

I traced it with my finger, from just below her armpit, over the speed bumps of her ribs, to her hip bone.

She had a boyfriend, so we couldn’t date, but we chatted online, learning about each other’s lives while we traded YouTube clips of our favorite Saturday Night Live sketches.

We sat so close I could smell her sweat, though the chemicals of infatuation turned it into a sweet perfume.

I secretly enjoy doing my taxes.

(Shocker: People’s feelings are never wrong.).

She thanked me for the flowers and didn’t even mention the letter. I knew then our relationship was over.

Because fixing something, especially when it’s a person, is what makes a man feel most valuable.

In the movies the romantic gesture works, but it failed me in real life. This was like Diane Court coming to the window only to shut it so she could go back to sleep. I gave her my heart; she thanked me for the $12.99 flowers.

“Happily ever after” is too boring for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

She was simply someone who had fallen out of love with her boyfriend. Which happens. It’s really uncinematic, but it happens.

I don’t very much like not being liked very much!”.

“I’d like to see how this experiment turns out,” I wrote in conclusion. “The question is, do you?”.

Even though I was riding in an ambulance to surgery, that one still stung.

We came up with an absurd screenplay idea, a horror movie set in a hospital.

I felt like a ghost returning to the scene of my own murder.

Sometimes when a guy really likes a girl, he gets a tattoo on his arm. I got this prominent scar instead. But there are times when I finger its deep groove (a new nervous tic), those six beautiful hours in the emergency room flicker in my head, and I am reminded how close I am to an alternate world in which I am happy, a world that occupies the same space as this one but is somehow distinct from it. And while that better world may be difficult to find, it is as close to me as the air in front of my face.

They didn’t say they craved attention but had trouble giving it to others. They didn’t say how cruel they could be.

Maybe he had seeds of doubt and realized what it takes a lot of other people years to figure out: that those seeds of doubt can spread tendrils through your body until they eventually strangle your heart.

There was only so much life to live, and no time to spend it with people who weren’t the very best fit.

This time our bonding was instantaneous and absolute, the kind shared between shipwreck survivors on a bobbing yellow life raft.

“These prickly little bastards is some tough hombres,” he explained. “Just like you and me. We may be in the desert right now, but I’m here to tell ya that we’ll get through this.”.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time:.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time: depressed that you identify with the sentiment, and hopeful because someone feels more miserable than you.

Would they still be happy and smiling in a year’s time, knowing as we did that to love is to risk great unhappiness?.

Personal setbacks and romantic rejection, according to authorities ranging from the Dalai Lama to the editors of CosmoGirl, offer us all opportunities to behave with grace and courage and self-respect.

I wanted her back so bad it gave me a stomachache.

“She’s dead to me,” I told my friends. “I was mentally ill to have dated her,” I told my friends. “Obviously a borderline personality,” I told my friends. “Why did I throw away the best thing I ever had?” I wrote in my journal. “Please, God, bring her back.”.

I lost ten pounds in two weeks.

For some reason I’ve always been susceptible to thinking my life would be vastly improved by the solution to a single problem.

“Ghosting is the most cowardly way to end a relationship,” I once said to a male friend in a room with a guy who had ghosted me years before.

“I feel so lucky right now,” he said. “I can’t believe a girl like you would give me the time of day.”.

“But I don’t want a guy to be nice to me just because he feels obligated to, you know? I want him to be nice because he means it.”.

Some guys say they know immediately She’s the One. Not me. Whether it’s a sweater or software, it takes some time for me to know if I want to keep something, one reason I always save receipts. I can’t say there was an instance when I looked into the pale blue eyes of the girl I met over corned beef hash at a café in San Francisco and thought, This is it.

Now, after eight years, I know. When did I know? Was it how she helped me deal with the death of my grandfather? The relief I felt when she finally answered her cell on September 11? That great hike in Point Reyes? Because she cried when the Sox finally won? The way my nephew greets her like a rock star when she walks into the room? Perhaps I should have known right from the start, that morning of our cross-country trip, when she required one last trip to Arthur Bryant’s for a half slab of ribs for breakfast (and ten minutes into the meal saying to me, “Hey, baby, why don’t you pop open a beer?”). Or did I not truly know until seven years later when we found ourselves forced apart for more than a year? Who can say? It’s the big moments, maybe, but it’s the little moments as much or even more.

We had nothing to do but love each other and be happy.

The finish line was drawing closer. Why not have one last blossoming of the heart?.

Sam, I knew I was happy.

We followed our hearts and gambled, and for a few years we had a bit of heaven on earth.

Maybe love was just what people claimed to feel for anyone who’d put up with them.

That’s probably the beginning of love: when you see someone in a way that defies reality, but which makes perfect sense to you.

Reflected in the slump of her shoulders. I knew about despair. I wore it like a familiar coat, incapable of accepting what must be tolerated and petulantly ignoring what must be acknowledged. But at that moment—at the sight of such sadness in one usually so open and upbeat, sadness in the spirit of a woman who needed something from me—I wanted to offer more than mumbled words of apology. But I also knew that to push myself deeper into her world might carry us to a place where I might lose what I had made of myself, a place where I knew I could no longer hold tight to the hard reality that kept me sane.

“Where can I find a man silly enough to stay home with my boys when they have chicken pox?” she replied, smiling and lifting up to kiss the top of my head. “I like it that you put me first.”.

I chose to love Belinda, chose against my head-logic and with my heart-dreams.

Where once her husband was the center of her passionate universe, there is now a new sun in whose orbit she revolves.

If the most erotic form of foreplay to a mother of a small child is, as I’ve heard some women claim, loading the dishwasher or sweeping the floor, then he’s a master of titillation.

And afterward my husband will say that we, he and I, are the core of what he cherishes, that the children are satellites, beloved but tangential. He seems entirely unperturbed by loving me like this. Loving me more than his children does not bother him.

I was thirty-three years old when we adopted DJ, and I thought I knew what a broken heart looked like, how it felt, but I didn’t know anything. You know what a broken heart looks like? Like a sobbing teenager handing over a two-day-old infant she can’t take care of to a couple who she hopes can.

A lot of people who self-destruct don’t think twice about destroying their children in the process.

# Logical Chess: Move By Move: Every Move Explained New Algebraic Edition (Irving Chernev) (Chernev, Irving)

Develop knights before bishops!.

One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap.

“The best attacking piece is the king’s bishop,” says Tarrasch, so White puts this piece to work and clears the way for early castling.

“You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.”.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.” This.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.”.

The act of leaving the back rank constitutes a developing move.

“Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.”.

“In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.”.

The knight possesses the peculiar property of being able to attack any other piece (except another knight) without being under attack in return.

In queen’s pawn openings, Black’s queen’s knight often does a better job at d7 than at c6.

But why give the king’s permanent address when White has revealed that he is preparing an assault on the kingside?.

“As Rousseau could not compose without his cat beside him, so I without my king’s bishop cannot play chess,”.

“In its absence the game to me is lifeless and cold. The vitalizing factor is missing, and I can devise no plan of attack.”.

The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings.

The pawn attacks the bishop that attacks the knight that defends the pawn that the knight attacks.

This is the point! The knight gives up his good position for a worthy cause. It is important, in order to capitalize on the weakness of the dark square f6, to remove the guardian of this square, the dark-squared bishop on e7.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don’t do this because they don’t have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common-sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one’s own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies.

Begin with 1 e4 or 1 d4, either of which moves releases two pieces.

Anchor at least one pawn in the centre and give it solid support. Pawns in the centre keep enemy pieces from settling themselves on the best squares.

There is danger, though, in attempting this before the king has castled.

Strategically, this represents a triumph for White. Not only does he remain with the advantage of the two bishops against Black’s knight and bishop, but he has also compelled Black’s remaining bishop to take up an unfavourable post, while White retains control of the long light-squared diagonal.

The point of playing 2 c4 so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king.

It took many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop’s development.

All moves must be made with respect to the threats of the opponent, not to arbitrary judgements which declare that certain moves are always ‘good’ or ‘bad’.

The c-pawn must be free to advance and attack White’s centre.

Why not win a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 xd5 instead? There would then follow 6... xd5! (the knight breaks the pin by brute force) 7 xd8 b4+ 8 d2 xd2+ 9 xd2 xd8 and Black has gained a piece.

Notice that White’s pawn at a3 prevents Black from regaining the pawn by 10... b4+, showing that White’s sixth move was not a waste of time.

Notice that he plays no combinations of any sort, either to win material or to start an attack on the king, until most of his pieces are brought off the back rank and into play. It.

Chess Analysed: or Instructions by Which a Perfect Knowledge of This Noble Game May in a Short Time Be Acquired: “A pawn, when separated from his fellows, will seldom or never make a fortune.”.

“He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.”.

It is important to keep the pawn position in the centre fluid. It is important to maintain pressure on White’s d-pawn in the centre. It is important to retain the option of exchanging pawns in the centre.

Rooks must seize open files! What if there are none? Then bring your rooks toward the centre! They will then be at the head of files most likely to be opened. That is why the king’s rook is usually developed at e8 or d8, while the queen’s rook goes to d8 or c8.

“offers the maximum of security with the maximum of opportunity.”.

Whether objectively this is the strongest move is immaterial; the fact that the bishop’s pressure bothers Black is enough reason for Janowsky to maintain the pin!.

In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings.

In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings with only pawns on the board are the easiest to win.

“The hardest thing is to win a won game”.

Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it.


# Barely Functional Adult (Meichi Ng)

There’s only a small sliver of time to follow through on your fun, impractical notions before that pesky voice of reason reels you out of it—so you gotta act fast.

But instead of that license being proof of my competence as a driver, all it proves is that it’s much too easy to get a license.

I’ve never held any of the core competencies one would want of a driver—like the ability to focus—so as a courtesy to the world, I do not drive.

When we arrived at the pet store, my friend asked me why I wasn’t getting a dog or a cat. People always assume it’s one or the other when you declare your intention of acquiring a pet. It really throws off their worldview when your pet species goes beyond the fourth letter of the alphabet.

In fairness, I love both cats and dogs. But it was important for me to get a pet that didn’t have abandonment issues. I didn’t want a pet that would be sad whenever I left for work; I have enough guilt in my life as is. So instead, I focused my search on a pet companion that would love me—but at a comfortable distance. The kind of emotionally independent love that is there when you need it, but won’t swallow you whole. Try not to psychoanalyze that.

It’s easy to love things that are beautiful, but Bobo was far from beautiful. While the other fish in his tank had shimmering, buttercup-yellow scales that effortlessly glistened with every movement in the water, Bobo’s coat was more of a dull mustard color. Even as he anxiously darted from one corner of the tank to the other, his scales shimmered half-heartedly, as though they had long given up on the facade of beauty.

There is something to be said about the people who are able to give us the exact kind of junk we love.

Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.

Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.

It’s the kind of high you could spend your life chasing.

I spent the years that followed feeling silly that someone was able to make such a lasting impact on my life in such a short period of time, but I’ve since learned that time and impact are disturbingly uncorrelated when it comes to the people we love.

But grief presents itself as different monsters for different people.

People say things they don’t mean when they’re hurt,.

When our songs came on the radio, I would find Gum in my ears.

Trying to get over someone you can’t get over is like seeing a bridge and knowing full well that the only thing that separates you from eternal happiness is that one bridge.

My understanding of “moving on” has shifted substantially over the years. I no longer consider moving on to be synonymous with not caring. I think it’s more complex than that. I think moving on is about allowing ourselves to remember the good and the bad, to distinguish the past from the present, and to accept who we are, who we were, and everyone we met along the way.

I should have negotiated my salary, but my parents had always taught me to be thankful instead of asking for more.

The reasonable thing to do would have been to just accept it—to accept what most sensible adults have come to accept—that work is a pointless sacrifice to the gods in order to afford the basic necessities and niceties of life.

My tears are to be saved for sad movies—not sad managers,.

But I think there’s value in knowing when to call it, in knowing when to get up and leave, in knowing when we’re done—even if it means having to walk out into the unknown to start all over again.

“Sometimes I feel like . . . nothing I do is ever good enough or will ever be good enough,” I said, opening yet another jar. “What makes you think that?” my therapist asked. “Well, I look back at something I made three years ago and I feel like it’s total garbage. Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .”.

Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .” I paused briefly here before resuming in a low and conspiratorial whisper, “what if . . . everything I do is always and forever going to be garbage?” I gave my therapist a piercing look, as if daring her to find fallacy in my airtight argument. My therapist simply returned a knowing smile. “And what would it mean to you if everything you do is garbage?” she asked. “Well it would mean that I’m gar . . .” I stopped short of finishing that sentence, but we both knew what I was about to say. I turned away to look out one of the windows before continuing. “I guess . . . one day, I’d just like to look at something I made and be proud of it . . . is all,” I said, hoping to end on a lighter note. My therapist gave me a sympathetic smile and a meaningful look. I hated how it actually made me feel a tiny bit better.

The sky can keep its lousy wishes, I thought. Surely, a shooting star wasn’t that much better than a regular star, and there were plenty of regular stars out there. I decided right then and there that if patience was a virtue, then it would have to be a virtue I lived without.

The kind of mutual best friendships that never needed further validation.

And who knows how many times you’re allowed to say no before you stop getting invited altogether.

I guess I always held this suspicion that people put on different versions of themselves in a group setting. And until you’ve talked to someone one-on-one, you don’t really know what they’re like under that mask. And.

And sure, enjoying the company of just one friend at a time may be more time-consuming, but isn’t it nice to know someone cares enough about you to spend time with just you? And not only when it’s a bundled deal with other people?.

But then again, I had friends back home. I guess when you take something for granted and it’s suddenly lost—you tend to feel a bit lost in return.

Don’t think anyone really needs friends, but maybe they’re just nice to have.

I wanted friends who could co-own bookstore speakeasies with me—the kind of friends you get from decades of friendship. I wanted this kind of deep, meaningful friendship and I wanted it in ten seconds flat.

When I packed my bags to move to another country, I forgot to pack my friends. I guess I just thought they were something I could easily pick up after I had settled in . . . like laundry detergent or potted plants.

Pretending to be extroverted when you’re introverted is about as fun as shoving your face into a dirty bucket of ice.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself. Pointless conversations can go on for hours, but you won’t feel the hours. And if you should say something questionable, they’ll know it’s because you’re having a bad week, and not because you’re a bad person. True friends see the best parts of us, even when we forget those parts ourselves.

If you say something questionable, you become questionable as a person.

True friends know how many siblings you have—that kind of thing is just basic friendship knowledge.

I began to wonder if I would ever come across that friend click again. The kind of friendship where we could share custody of a pet alpaca. And sure, we wouldn’t be able to go on vacation at the same time because someone would (obviously) have to stay and take care of the alpaca, but that’s a sacrifice I’d be willing to make.

I began to remember who I was when I didn’t have to be someone else for other people, and in this version of myself, I met friends who I actually connected with—the kind of friendships that clicked.

Only after I built my perfect home did I realize that I longed for stars not roof on my head. But I guess it was fine, somethings only get inside your head once you have a roof on your head..

In time,.

“Wishing Tree, here I come,” I whispered to myself. It was completely unnecessary to whisper, but that just made it all the more necessary.

Well, technically, they were raising me up, but I was a reluctant passenger on this spaceship to monotony.

Sure, it does take me a lot longer to recover from a night out, and I did find an unverified wrinkle the other day, but I didn’t know that it meant that I was old, I just assumed it meant I was not young.

Trees are majestic beings—nature’s historians who silently safeguard the riddles of our universe.

I guess when you really want something, it’s just easier to assume you won’t get it.

Not getting something you really want is disheartening enough without also having to be consoled by others.

I enlisted the best free labor I had access to—my family.

I don’t fully understand the magic or logic behind it, but sometimes a stranger, with no sense of boundaries, asking you deeply personal questions is exactly what you need to hear in order to rethink your life.

I think we’re allowed to just . . . do whatever it is that we want to do. Whatever it is that makes us happy.

And in trying to figure out what we want to do, in trying to figure out what makes us happy, we’re bound to feel a little lost at times. But maybe this sense of feeling lost is necessary. Maybe feeling lost is what pushes us to keep exploring. It’s the ethereal song that awakens our curiosities and drives us to follow cows, discover hidden coves, and find remnants of good in a world that so often feels too dark and broken.

Maybe feeling lost is just the prerequisite of adventure—the first chapter of any good story.

A portrait-painter, he called himself, but he hadn't painted any portraits. He was sitting on the side-lines with a blanket over his shoulders, waiting for a chance to get into the game.

Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I'm a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn't. I forgot them.

Have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married and then been introduced to her husband? If so you'll understand how I felt when Clarence burst on me. You know the feeling. First of all, when you hear about the marriage, you say to yourself, “I wonder what he's like.” Then you meet him, and think, “There must be some mistake. She can't have preferred this to me!” That's what I thought, when I set eyes on Clarence.

He had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point. About once a month he would take three days writing a few poems; the other three hundred and twenty-nine days of the year he rested.

The corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch, and for a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fish's.

You know, I rather think I agree with those poet-and-philosopher Johnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if he has a bit of trouble. All that stuff about being refined by suffering, you know. Suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and more sympathetic outlook. It helps you to understand other people's misfortunes if you've been through the same thing yourself.

I've often heard that chappies, after some great shock or loss, have a habit, after they've been on the floor for a while wondering what hit them, of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together, and sort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life. Time, the great healer, and Nature, adjusting itself, and so on and so forth. There's a lot in it. I know, because in my own case, after a day or two of what you might call prostration, I began to recover. The frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery, but at least I found that I was able to have a dash at enjoying life again. What I mean is, I braced up to the extent of going round the cabarets once more, so as to try to forget, if only for the moment.

He told me once that he could sit on a fence, watching a worm and wondering what on earth it was up to, for hours at a stretch.


# The Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess (Patrick Wolff)

To begin a game, the board must be placed so that the right-hand corner square nearest each player is white. Throughout this book, we will refer to pictures of the board, called “Diagrams,” that look like Diagram 1. Notice that the bottom right-hand corner in this and every Diagram is white!.

A file is a row of eight squares going from top to bottom. A rank is a row of eight squares going from left to right. Notice that a chessboard has eight files and eight ranks.

“The pawn is the soul of chess,”.

Each side gets only one queen.

Sometimes people get confused about whether the white queen starts on d1 or e1, and whether the black queen starts on d8 or e8. It is easy to remember if you keep in mind that chess was played when chivalry was still very much alive, so as a sign of respect to the queen it always starts the game on the same color square as she.

If you have a computer you can play chess with, here’s a good way to practice reading and writing chess moves: Play a game against the computer, and have it list the moves of the game. While you are playing, you should write down both your moves and its moves without looking at the computer’s list of the moves. When the game is finished, compare your record of the moves with the computer’s.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture it. In Diagrams 1 and 2, by moving two squares forward the white pawn was able to pass by the d3 square, which the black pawn controls, and get to safety on d4. In doing so, it “passed by” the opposing pawn’s control of the square in front of it. The en passant rule gives the opposing pawn one chance to capture the pawn as if it had moved only one square; that is, to capture it as it passes by the square it controls. But the opposing pawn only gets one chance! If it doesn’t capture the pawn on the very next move, then the en passant capture is no longer possible.

What’s the complaint?.

Chess is a really interesting game. All pieces can move forward or backward, other than pawns who can pawns. But that's not the reason why chess is interesting. All pieces remain themselves, or they die as the game proceed. A queen starts as a queen and ends as a queen, alive or dead. A bishop starts as a bishop and ends as a bishop, alive or dead. But a pawn, a pawn if alive, has the potential to became a knight, or bishop, or rook, or even a queen. A pwan can be whatever it wishes to be on reaching the end of line. You know why? Because a pawn will sacrifice itself, but will not move backwards.

The tunnel does have light at the end of it, even if we aren’t able to see it. And there’s a two-for-one offer on clouds and silver linings. Words, just sometimes, can set you free.

That said, if books had to replicate our exact experience of the world to be useful, the only books worth reading would be written by ourselves.

Misery, like yoga, is not a competitive sport. But I have found over the years that by reading about other people who have suffered, survived and overcome despair I have felt comforted. It has given me hope. I hope this book can do the same.

‘But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.’ —Albert Camus, A Happy Death.

The weirdest thing about a mind is that you can have the most intense things going on in there but no one else can see them.

That old classic wish. To never have been born.

(The poet Melissa Broder once tweeted: ‘what idiot called it “depression” and not “there are bats living in my chest and they take up a lot of room, ps. I see a shadow”?’).

It can affect people – millionaires, people with good hair, happily married people, people who have just landed a promotion, people who can tap dance and do card tricks and strum a guitar, people who have no noticeable pores, people who exude happiness in their status updates – who seem, from the outside, to have no reason to be miserable.

The idea that madness should be allowed to be madness.

The idea that madness should be allowed to be madness. That a fearful, repressive society brands anyone different as ill.

I think life always provides reasons to not die, if we listen hard enough.

It underlines the idea we have hammered into us by the hundred thousand TV ads we have seen that everything can be fixed by consuming things. It.

It underlines the idea we have hammered into us by the hundred thousand TV ads we have seen that everything can be fixed by consuming things.

One lesson learned from treating chronic pain is that it is tough to override responses that are hardwired into the body and mind.

For instance, if you live in Greenland you are twenty-seven times more likely to kill yourself than if you live in Greece.

I felt like an outsider, with my left-wing, middle-class parents in a right-wing, working-class town.

‘ . . . once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.’ —Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore.

‘Incipient insanity was mainly a matter of chemicals,’.

Exercise definitely helps me, as does yoga and absorbing myself in something or someone I love, so I keep doing these things. I suppose, in the absence of universal certainties, we are our own best laboratory.

‘Monsters are real,’ Stephen King said. ‘And ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.’.

The way people seem to cope is by not thinking about it too much.

LIFE IS HARD. It may be beautiful and wonderful but it is also hard. The way people seem to cope is by not thinking about it too much. But some people are not going to be able to do that. And besides, it is the human condition. We think therefore we are. We know we are going to grow old, get ill and die. We know that is going to happen to everyone we know, everyone we love. But also, we have to remember, the only reason we have love in the first place is because of this. Humans might well be the only species to feel depression as we do, but that is simply because we are a remarkable species, one that has created remarkable things – civilisation, language, stories, love songs. Chiaroscuro means a contrast of light and shade. In Renaissance paintings of Jesus, for instance, dark shadow was used to accentuate the light bathing Christ. It is a hard thing to accept, that death and decay and everything bad leads to everything good, but I for one believe it. As Emily Dickinson, eternally great poet and occasionally anxious agoraphobe, said: ‘That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet.’.

WHEN I WAS most severely depressed I had quite a vast collection of related mental illnesses. We humans love to compartmentalise things. We love to divide our education system into separate subjects, just as we love to divide our shared planet into nations, and our books into separate genres. But the reality is that things are blurred. Just as being good at mathematics often means someone is good at physics, so having depression means it probably comes with other things.

Minds have their own weather systems. You are in a hurricane. Hurricanes run out of energy eventually. Hold on.

Pain is a debt paid off with time.

‘Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile. Which is to say, don’t kill yourself. Even when the darkness is total. Always know that life is not still. Time is space. You are moving through that galaxy. Wait for the stars.’.

You will one day experience joy that matches this pain. You will cry euphoric tears at the Beach Boys, you will stare down at a baby’s face as she lies asleep in your lap, you will make great friends, you will eat delicious foods you haven’t tried yet, you will be able to look at a view from a high place and not assess the likelihood of dying from falling. There are books you haven’t read yet that will enrich you, films you will watch while eating extra-large buckets of popcorn, and you will dance and laugh and have sex and go for runs by the river and have late-night conversations and laugh until it hurts. Life is waiting for you. You might be stuck here for a while, but the world isn’t going anywhere. Hang on in there if you can. Life is always worth it.

At university our friends always considered us to be a happy couple. And we were, except for the other half of the time when we were an unhappy couple.

This was a kind of kindness. She never could cope if someone felt awkward, and so always bent to meet them as much as she could. I think – if I offered her anything – it was the chance to be herself.

The best gift we can offer our friends is a chance to be themselves.

‘we forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people’,.

‘we forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people’, then love – at its best – is a way to reclaim those lost parts of ourselves. That freedom we lost somewhere quite early in childhood. Maybe love is just about finding the person you can be your weird self with.

I helped her be her, and she helped me be me. We did this through talking. In our first year together we would very often stay up all night talking. The night would start with us going to the wine shop at the bottom of Sharp Street in Hull (the street my student house was on) and buying a bottle of wine we couldn’t afford, and would very often end with us watching breakfast TV on my old Hitachi, which required constant manoeuvring of the aerial to see the picture.

But the arguments were surface stuff. If you go deep enough under a tidal wave the water is still. That is what we were like. In a way we argued because we knew it would have no fundamental impact. When you can be yourself around someone, you project your dissatisfied self outwards. And in Ibiza, I was that. I was not happy. And part of my personality was this: when I was unhappy, I tried to drown.

She encouraged me to read, to write. She earned us money. She gave us time. She handled all the organisational side of my life, the stuff you need to do to tick over.

She filled in the blanks that worry and darkness had left in its wake. She was my mind-double. My life-sitter. My literal other half when half of me had gone. She covered for me, waiting patiently like a war wife, during my absence from myself.

There are seven billion versions of normal on this planet.

But so, increasingly, were books. I read and read and read with an intensity I’d never really known before. I mean, I’d always considered myself to be a person who liked books. But there is a difference between liking books and needing them. I needed books. They weren’t a luxury good during that time in my life. They were a Class A addictive substance. I’d have gladly got into serious debt to read (indeed, I did). I think I read more books in those six months than I had done during five years of university education, and I’d certainly fallen deeper into the worlds conjured on the page. There is this idea that you either read to escape or you read to find yourself. I don’t really see the difference.

There is this idea that you either read to escape or you read to find yourself. I don’t really see the difference. We find ourselves through the process of escaping. It is not where we are, but where we want to go, and all that. ‘Is there no way out of the mind?’ Sylvia Path famously asked. I had been interested in this question (what it meant, what the answers might be) ever since I had come across it as a teenager in a book of quotations. If there is a way out, a way that isn’t death itself, then the exit route is through words. But rather than leave the mind entirely, words help us leave a mind, and give us the building blocks to build another one, similar but better, nearby to the old one but with firmer foundations, and very often a better view.

‘The object of art is to give life a shape,’ said Shakespeare. And my life – and my mess of a mind – needed shape. I had ‘lost the plot’. There was no linear narrative of me. There was just mess and chaos. So yes, I loved external narratives for the hope they offered.

They were, in and of themselves, reasons to stay alive.

Every book written is the product of a human mind in a particular state. Add all the books together and you get the end sum of humanity.

Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself. But each map was incomplete, and I would only locate the treasure if I read all the books, and so the process of finding my best self was an endless quest. And books themselves seemed to me to reflect this idea. Which is why the plot of every book ever can be boiled down to ‘someone is looking for something’.

‘Hate is a lack of imagination,’ we are told.

‘There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in.’.

Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino – The most beautiful book. Imaginary cities, each kind of like Venice but not at all like Venice. Dreams on a page. So unreal they could almost dislodge my strange mind-visions.

The Outsiders, S.E. Hinton – The book that got me properly into reading as a ten-year-old. Has always been my favourite ‘escape’ read. It drips with America and has gorgeously sentimental dialogue. (Like: ‘Stay gold, Ponyboy’, said by Johnny, on his death bed, after reading Robert Frost’s ‘Nothing Gold Can Stay’.).

The Concise Collins Dictionary of Quotations – Quotations are easy to read.

Letters of Keats – I had studied Keats at university. The archetypal young poet was thin-skinned and doomed and intense, and I felt these things.

Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Jeanette Winterson – I loved Jeanette’s writing. Every word contained strength or wisdom. I picked it up at random pages to see sentences that could speak to me. ‘I seem to have run in a great circle, and met myself again on the starting line.’.

Vox, Nicholson Baker – A novel that consists entirely of an episode of phone sex, that had titillated and enthralled me when I was sixteen. Pure dialogue. Again, easy to read, and full of sex, or the idea of sex, and for a young, anxiety-riddled mind, thinking of sex can be a positive distraction.

The Catcher in the Rye, J.D. Salinger – Because Holden was an old friend.

The Penguin Book of First World War Poetry – Poems like Ivor Gurney’s ‘Strange Hells’ (‘The heart burns – but has to keep out of face how heart burns’) and Wilfred Owen’s ‘Mental Cases’ (describing the shell-shocked patients of a mental hospital) fascinated me but troubled me. I had been through no war and yet I related to that feeling of pain contained in every new day, as ‘Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh’. It fascinated me how depression and anxiety overlap with post-traumatic stress disorder. Had we been through some trauma we didn’t know about? Was the noise and speed of modern life the trauma for our caveman brains? Was I that soft? Or was life a kind of war most people didn’t see? A.

A History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters, Julian Barnes – Just because it was a book I had read and loved before and which was funny and strange and I knew it inside out.

Wilderness Tips, Margaret Atwood – Short stories. Smaller hills to climb. A story called ‘True Trash’ was my favourite. About teenage boys perving at waitresses.

The best way to beat a monster is to find a scarier one.

‘Travel makes one modest,’ said Gustave Flaubert. ‘You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.’ Such perspective can be strangely liberating. Especially when you have an illness that may on the one hand lower self-esteem, but on the other intensifies the trivial.

‘There’s too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes.’.

‘The wound is the place where the light enters you.’.

‘Forget safety. Live where you fear to live.’).

Like Haruki Murakami – whose excellent book What I Talk About When I Talk About Running I would later read – I found running to be a way of clearing the fog.

To go on a run every day is to have a kind of battle with yourself.

Weapons for the war that subsides but that can always ignite again. And so writing, reading, talking, travelling, yoga, meditation and running were some of mine.

It is like the distance between a writer and their fictional, semi-autobiographical narrator.

And what does this teach us? That depression can happen to prime ministers and presidents and cricketers and playwrights and boxers and the stars of hit Hollywood comedies.

While we know it can happen to anyone, we can never be told too many times that it can actually happen to anyone.

She told the interviewer that the only thing that stopped her was the thought of her mother finding her.

Actually, depression can be exacerbated by things being all right externally, because the gulf between what you are feeling and what you are expected to feel becomes larger.

Actually, depression can be exacerbated by things being all right externally, because the gulf between what you are feeling and what you are expected to feel becomes larger. If you feel the same amount of depression as someone would naturally feel in a prisoner of war camp, but you are not in a prisoner of war camp, and are instead in a nice semi-detached house in the free world, then you think ‘Crap, this is everything I ever wanted, why aren’t I happy?’.

As any Buddhist would tell you, an over-attachment to material things will lead only to more suffering.

It is said that insanity is a logical response to an insane world. Maybe depression is in part simply a response to a life we don’t really understand. Of course, no one understands their life completely if they think about it. An annoying thing about depression is that thinking about life is inevitable. Depression makes thinkers out of all of us. Just ask Abraham Lincoln.

The political philosopher John Gray – one of my favourite non-fiction writers (read Straw Dogs to see why).

The political philosopher John Gray – one of my favourite non-fiction writers (read Straw Dogs to see why) – believes Churchill didn’t ‘overcome’ depression to become a good war leader, rather that the experience of depression directly enabled him to be one.

A lot of Freud’s work was based on his analysis of his own depression, and what he believed to be the solution. Cocaine was what worked for him, but then – after dishing it out to other sufferers – he started to realise it could be a tad addictive.

Kafka’s most famous story is The Metamorphosis. A travelling salesman wakes up to find himself transformed into a giant insect, who has overslept and is late for work. It is a story about the dehumanising effect of capitalism, yes, but it can equally be read as a metaphor for depression, the most Kafkaesque of illnesses. For, like Gregor Samsa, the depressive can sometimes wake up in the room they fell asleep in, and yet feel totally different. An alien to themselves. Trapped in a nightmare.

Fear makes us curious. Sadness makes us philosophise. (‘To be or not to be?’ is a daily question for many depressives.).

Lincoln didn’t do great work because he solved the problem of his melancholy; the problem of his melancholy was all the more fuel for the fire of his great work.’.

For instance, I find that being grimly aware of mortality can make me steadfastly determined to enjoy life where life can be enjoyed.

There can be infinity inside a day.

To panic without a reason, that’s madness. To panic with a reason, that’s sanity.

‘If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment. Live in the breath.’.

Anaïs Nin called anxiety ‘love’s greatest killer’. But fortunately, the reverse is also true. Love is anxiety’s greatest killer. Love is an outward force. It is our road out of our own terrors, because anxiety is an illness that wraps us up in our own nightmares. This is not selfishness, even though people read it as such. If your leg is on fire, it is not selfish to concentrate on the pain, or the fear of the flames. So it is with anxiety. People with mental illnesses aren’t wrapped up in themselves because they are intrinsically any more selfish than other people. Of course not. They are just feeling things that can’t be ignored. Things that point the arrows inward. But having people who love you and who you love is such a help. This doesn’t have to be romantic, or even familial love. Forcing yourself to see the world through love’s gaze can be healthy. Love is an attitude to life. It can save us.

I still haven’t seen Iceland where my ashes will be scattered.

He’s my lighthouse in the storm.

Reading Emily Dickinson poems.

Reading Keats’ letters.

‘We blow out a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although with the perfect certainty that it will burst.’.

We cannot save ourselves from suffering by buying an iPhone. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy one, it just means we should know such things are not ends in themselves.

The idea that kindness makes us happier than selfishness.

To be selfless, while being mindful, seems to be a good solution, when the self intensifies and causes us to suffer.

How to stop time: kiss. How to travel in time: read. How to escape time: music. How to feel time: write. How to release time: breathe.

There is absolutely nothing in the past that you can change. That’s basic physics.

Kurt Vonnegut was right. ‘Reading and writing are the most nourishing forms of meditation anyone has so far found.’.

Don’t feel guilty about being idle. More harm is probably done to the world through work than idleness. But perfect your idleness. Make it mindful.

Wherever you are, at any moment, try and find something beautiful. A face, a line out of a poem, the clouds out of a window, some graffiti, a wind farm. Beauty cleans the mind.

Hate is a pointless emotion to have inside you. It is like eating a scorpion to punish it for stinging you.

Shower before noon.

Look at the sky. Remind yourself of the cosmos. Seek vastness at every opportunity, in order to see the smallness of yourself.

Read a book without thinking about finishing it. Just read it. Enjoy every word, sentence, and paragraph. Don’t wish for it to end, or for it to never end.

Three in the morning is never the time to try and sort out your life.

Read Emily Dickinson. Read Graham Greene. Read Italo Calvino. Read Maya Angelou. Read anything you want. Just read. Books are possibilities. They are escape routes. They give you options when you have none. Each one can be a home for an uprooted mind.

Remember that the key thing about life on earth is change. Cars rust. Paper yellows. Technology dates. Caterpillars become butterflies. Nights morph into days. Depression lifts.

Reading The Tiger Who Came to Tea, and doing the tiger’s voice.

Cities twinkling at night as you drive past them, as if they are fallen constellations of stars.

“When does a war end?” he asks her of her memories of Vietnam. “When can I say your name and have it mean only your name and not what you left behind?”.


# The Fitness Mindset: Eat for energy, Train for tension, Manage your mindset, Reap the results (Keane, brian)

‘People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel’.

1g of carbohydrates has 4 calories 1g of protein has 4 calories 1g of fat has 9 calories Various foods are a compilation of these three building blocks. Therefore, if you know how many carbohydrates, fats and proteins are present in any given food item, you can calculate how many calories or how much energy that food contains. Below is an example of the formula for calculating the number of calories in a food.

Further in this chapter, I will discuss how making one simple change – eliminating or greatly reducing processed foods – can have an incredibly beneficial impact on your body’s ability to burn body fat or build lean muscle.

Combining legumes with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds or nuts such as walnuts, almonds or cashew provides complete proteins. One of my personal favourites is a trail mix of nuts, cashews, sunflower seeds with hummus or guacamole dip and raw vegetables.

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that keeps your nerves and blood cells healthy.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen. Personally, I use vitamin B12 spray every single day for the regulation of my nervous system, which can also reduce stress, worry and anxiety. However, there are numerous other benefits to adding B12 to your supplement regimen if you are not consuming it from food.

Long-term deficiency puts you at a risk of nerve degeneration, mental disturbance and depression amongst a host of other problems.

Once these symptoms manifest, it’s nearly impossible to fully recover. The take-home message is to make sure that you get enough vitamin B12 from your meat or consider adding it to your supplement regimen. Personally, I only eat red meat once or twice a week, so I hedge my bets and supplement with.

‘The first recorded heart attack was in 1912 and by 1930 the number of heart attacks had reached 3,000 and by 1960, there were over 500,000 deaths recorded from heart attacks.’.

Modern breakfast cereals and cereal bars for example are so highly processed, high in sugar and devoid of absorbable nutrients that they leave you fighting a losing blood sugar battle for the rest of the day. The answer is to eat more fat.

Vegans who eat more seeds tend to have much higher levels of omega 3 as well.

Omega 3 is actively involved in critical biological functions such as improving cognitive abilities, helping you retain information better, helping you perform complicated tasks more effectively, alleviating pain and inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity.

Nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews).

Seeds (pumpkin, linseed, chia).

Keeping your energy and blood sugar levels stable and in balance can allow you to train harder without getting food cravings associated with blood sugar drops, which can come from missing meals and snacks. This can give you a significantly better quality of life by increasing your overall energy levels, as a result helping you lose body fat and/or building lean muscle in the process.

This means that if you consume 200mg of caffeine at 12 midday, 100mg will still be in your system at 5pm.

‘unless people get to bed by 10:30pm and get a full eight hours of sleep, they’re wasting their money’.

Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

Too much protein can raise the alertness chemical in the brain called orexin, which can disrupt your sleep. Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

The Honey Prescription, a small amount of raw honey has a similar effect on relaxing your body before bed. Furthermore, combining honey with some MCT oil will not throw you out of the fat-burning mode, as the shortest-length MCT derived from a supplement produces ketones even in the presence of carbohydrates.

GABA is great at bed time, but can also be used during the day if you’re highly stressed or dealing with anxiety.

Also sold as 5HTP, L-tryptophan is normally talked about after Christmas or thanksgiving dinner, as turkey is particularly high in this amino acid. L-tryptophan can allow your brain to release serotonin (one of our brains happy hormones), which can help you unwind before bed.

A 2% drop in body water can cause a small yet critical shrinkage of the brain, which can impair coordination and massively decrease concentration. Dehydration can also reduce endurance, decrease strength, cause cramping and slow-down muscular response.

There are numerous different training systems and styles that can work great for people, but I’ve found that in order to build a leaner, more muscular or toned physique, there’s one thing that you need to do above all else – tear muscle fibres by creating tension on the muscle.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout. In order for your muscles to repair, your metabolism has to increase, lending itself to burning more calories while you rest.

Tension-style training means keeping the muscle you are working under optimal tension throughout the duration of the movement, i.e. two seconds on the way down, 1 second hold at the bottom or top and two seconds on the way up (2:1:2).

The take-home message is that it’s not about moving the weight from A to B – the aim is to create optimal tension for the duration of the movement and actually ‘feel’ the muscle you are working as a mind–muscle connection.

The best piece of gym advice that I have received was ‘Leave your ego at the door’.

Form: it’s not about the weight, it’s about how you move the weight.

Both systems work incredibly well and can be used interchangeably. My advice would be to use a rest pause on busier gym days, so that you don’t lose your bench or need extra sets of dumbbells and use drop sets when training at home or on quieter gym days.

Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

Aerobic activity by its very nature requires fat to be used as a primary fuel source, with carbohydrates and protein being used to a smaller extent. Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

There is no ‘one best cardio’ or aerobic activity. The key is to find the one you enjoy the most, which your body responds to, normally by reducing body fat and then using that as your primary source of cardio. If you hate to run, try swimming or cycling. If you love team sports, join a sports club and get your cardio that way.

Note: 70% of your max heart rate is your ‘fat-burning zone’ – to calculate your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are 28, it would be 220 minus 28, which is 192.

137-138 heart rate.

LISS is a good tool if your diet is clean – your carbs are low and you’re eating regular meals throughout the day alongside your weight-training program. But I’ve found that you do need to do longer spells of LISS, normally 15–20 minutes or more to see any noticeable changes.

HIIT on the other hand is ‘sprint training’. Its benefits are that it’s quick (five to ten minutes normally), burns through more glycogen (stored carbohydrates) and gives you a great feeling of accomplishment upon finish. Its negatives are that it’s difficult. And when done correctly, very difficult!.

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.).

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.). The key is to go as hard as possible for 30 seconds and then completely rest or recover for the next 30 seconds.

Depleting your glycogen levels by doing your weight training first and your cardio after could potentially allow you to tap into fat stores more effectively. Of course, as long as you are doing your cardio or getting your heart rate up alongside all the other tips mentioned in this book, you will burn body fat. This is just a quick tip that could potentially allow you to do it faster.

For 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout. Her pre-workout meal was chicken or fish, mixed vegetables and one tablespoon of almond butter or 150g of sweet potato. As she is focused on tension during her weight training, she is burning through all the glucose in her body at a pretty rapid rate – she’s not even half way through her workout, and is now very likely to be tapping into her stored carbohydrates (glycogen). Twenty minutes later, her glycogen is nearly completely depleted and she is now using fat as her primary fuel source. She finishes her workout with 10 minutes of HIIT. Two months later, Jane is leaner, fitter, slimmer, more toned, feels better and continues to train for the rest of the year.

Jane Smith trains four days every week for 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout.

Remember, progress is addictive: I don’t know a person in the world who could continue a workout regime with absolutely no progress. So arm yourself with knowledge and get better results in less time.

‘Push, pull, legs’ is the name of the training split for the movement patterns of that specific muscle group. ‘Push’ refers to all the movements where you use muscles that push the weight away from your body as their primary movement pattern – chest, shoulders and triceps. In ‘pull’, all the exercise is geared at pulling the weight toward your body as the muscles’ primary movement patterns – back, rear delts and biceps. ‘Legs’ refers to lower body-focused leg training.

If you use training as your ‘de-stress’ from work, then evening may be best for you.

Make training a priority, but try to fit it around your lifestyle and not the other way around.

Sets: The number of sets is the number of ‘rounds’ you do. For example, if you do 3 sets of 10 reps, you perform 10 reps of the exercise with a 2:1:2 tempo and then rest for 60 seconds. Repeat for your second and third set.

All the cardio in this program is based on HIIT. HIIT burns more calories, takes less time and works incredibly well to elevate metabolism while burning fat when incorporated into a tension styled program. I personally like using the rowing machine or a stationary bike, but HIIT can be done on any cardio machine.

For HIIT training, set a level that you can sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, reduce the level to a very easy pace and recover for these seconds. Repeat this process 10 times for a total of 10 minutes.

Each workout should take between 40–60 minutes. This program is about quality over quantity. Therefore, bring a stopwatch to time your rest periods, train intensely while in the gym and get out within 60 minutes, so that you don’t start to burn through any hard-earned muscle or overstress your central nervous system.

The entire training program is present below, but if you go to www.briankeanefitness.com you can download the videos that wgo through the entire workout and on how to perform each move correctly.

‘Don’t let your own worst enemy live between your two ears.’.

The first audio book I ever listened to was The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, which changed the way I looked at everything I did in my life.

Charles Duhigg talks about the ‘routine – cue – reward’ system of habits. In order to change a habit, you need to change one of the components of this system. The routine is the actual situation or ‘trigger’ – for me, the routine was coming home every day after work. The cue is what you do next, i.e. getting two or three bars from the cupboard and sitting in the same seat watching the same show. And the reward is serotonin release, the ‘happy hormone’ your brain releases from the chocolate.

For me, the routine of coming home from work was always going to be the same, so I changed the cue. Instead of reaching for chocolate bars in the cupboard, I left a pre-packed gym bag beside the front door. I would come home (routine), pick up my gym bag (new cue) and the reward came via the serotonin release from exercise.

I tried and lived my life by internalizing that there are only three ways to look at most of the things in your life: 1) the things you know; 2) the things you don’t know; and 3) the things you don’t know you don’t know.

I used and still use books, podcasts and following the right people on social media to bridge the gap between all three.

Son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

‘My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

There’s a great story in Darren Hardy’s The Compound Effect about a man riding a horse, galloping fast. It appears that’s he’s going somewhere very important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, ‘Where are you going?’ The rider replies, ‘I don’t know. Ask the horse!’.

Psychological studies reveal that 95% of everything we feel, think, do and achieve is a result of a learned habit.

All of the ‘hows’ mean nothing until you find your ‘why’.

I have what I call a ‘non job’ where my life and my job are one and the same.

We all experience emotions like frustration, anger or being overwhelmed and develop a strategy to end these feelings. Some people use food, some use sex, drugs or alcohol. Others use running, going to the gym or reading.

Her journey is her journey, and I have no control over it, but I have control over how much I am present in this journey and how much influence, advice and guidance I can provide to help develop her character along the way.

It might be a comment or a jibe from a friend or a loved one that gives you that spark to get into great shape or a friend who called you stupid that led you to read more books (my why for indulging in reading).

Thus, on days when you’re struggling and want to give up, recall the pain that made you get started and remember your why.

Stress is the figurative ‘death by a thousand cuts’ – you can get everything right with your nutrition, training and supplementation, but if you are in a constant state of fight or flight, stress or anxiety, you are going to struggle to hit your own natural potential.

‘I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most which never happened’.

How about those times when you felt just ‘off’ for no reason other than not feeling right – you just felt on edge, but everything in your life was perfectly fine. This affected me for years until I better understood how certain food ingredients, (additives, flavourings etc.) of certain processed foods had a direct impact on my mood and anxiety levels. If you want to know more about this, take a look at the nutrition section of the book if you’ve not done so yet.

Have you ever wondered why your dog gets happy every single time they see you? Dogs and other animals haven’t developed the part of the brain that allows them to picture the future, so when they see you, they are completely present every single time. They’re not worried about when you will go again, whether they will get food that day or any other scenario that may or may not happen.

Although developing our pre-frontal cortex has allowed us to build civilisations and create things beyond our wildest dreams, the trade off is we can sometimes lack ‘being present’ – or being in the actual moment because we are thinking about the future. Nine out of ten times, it’s normally worrying about something that hasn’t even happened yet – work the next day, paying our bills, etc. This is normally the foundation of anxiety.

‘Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but you never get anywhere’.

Your brain is like a Rottweiler guard dog – if you mind it, care for it and look after it, it will serve you for life, but if you mistreat it or don’t look after it, it can attack you, harm you and even kill you.

Deep down, most of us want to be accepted and liked by our peers and build positive and thriving relationships with people.

‘Become the person you want to be and then wait for reality to catch up with that version of you’.

My biggest goal in life is to leave the world better than how I had found it, and to instil my life’s philosophy into my daughter so that if she chooses to stand on the shoulders of giants, she has the character and a belief in herself to do it. I want the world to be better because we were here.

Sometimes, we determine our character by what we have or do, and that allows us to become that person. For example, if I have a nice car or a big house, then I will be successful, or if I do well in this show, test or exam, I can become successful. In my opinion, the sequence of actions in that model is wrong. It’s the ‘do, have and be’ model. If I do or have this, I can be that.

As I sat in the car feeling horribly sorry for myself, I looked into my audio book library and re-listened to one of my favourites: Mastery by Robert Greene.

The biggest difference in my life over the last two years, alongside the birth of my daughter, is my ability to take control of my wandering and unhelpful thoughts. Two years ago, if I were left to my own devices, my mind would wander off to the social interaction conversations I had that day, and my life never really changed. I had the same income, the same shape of mind and body, the same network of people I hung around with – nothing ever really progressed.

I know that philosophy helps strengthen my mindset, so I read Seneca or Marcus Aurelius before bed.

I think conflict avoidance is one the biggest detriments to happiness and has been the biggest factor in my own life for dealing with chronic worry. I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head.

I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head. I avoided the conversation or the situation because I wanted to avoid the feeling of unease that I knew would inevitably come from it.

Would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself.

I would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself to justify the situation: ‘Oh I don’t want to hurt this person’s feelings’ or ‘It’s probably not true anyway’, etc. There were times when I just didn’t want to admit that I was too much of a coward to take ownership of a situation.

Now, I like to think of tough words as workouts – all the growth and results come from leaning into the pain of the workout. If you are too comfortable when you work out, your body never really changes. You need to go outside of your comfort zone.

I always try to follow the 10% law: your goals and targets should be so high that even if you only hit 10% of it, you would have still achieved more than 99.9% of what you ever dreamed possible.

In every aspect of your life, it’s your choice whether you want to put ‘I’ in front of something (I am angry with those comments, I am annoyed someone would say that, I am disappointed that person used those words). These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself.

These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself. The criticism is not you and you are not the criticism.

Through the readings of Seneca and other stoic philosophers, I can now see from the perspective that sometimes, the criticism or negativity aimed in our direction is actually the other person’s way of consciously or subconsciously dealing with their own demons.

‘Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not the truth’.

When you can truly let go of the thoughts and opinions because that’s all they are, the world will be your oyster. Just ‘do you’ and be happy.

In Yu Dan’s book Confucius From The Heart , he talks about the necessity for benevolent, kind and frugal rulers, the importance of inner moral harmony and its direct connection with harmony in the physical world and how rulers and teachers are important role models for the wider society.

Find the things that make you happy, do more of it. Find the things that make you unhappy, do less of it.

# Where The Sidewalk Ends (Silverstein, Shel)

But all the magic I have known I’ve had to make myself.

This boat that we just built is just fine- And don’t try to tell us it’s not. The sides and the back are divine- It’s the bottom I guess we forgot….

And all the colors I am inside Have not been invented yet.

Oh, if you’re a bird, be an early bird And catch the worm for your breakfast plate. If you’re a bird, be an early early bird- But if you’re a worm, sleep late.

Ricky was “L” but he’s home with the flu, Lizzie, our “O,” had some homework to do, Mitchell, “E” prob’ly got lost on the way. So I’m all of love that could make it today.

If the world was crazy, you know what I’d do? I’d walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe, I’d fly through the ground and I’d skip through the air, I’d run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair. When I met somebody I’d say “G’bye, Joe,” And when I was leaving-then I’d say “Hello.” And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy So I would be king … if the world was crazy.

How do we tell if a window is open? Just throw a stone at it. Does it make a noise? It doesn’t? Well, it was open. Now let’s try another… CRASH! It wasn’t!.

Chester come to school and said, “Durn, I growed another head.” Teacher said,”It’s time you knowed The word is ‘grew’ instead of ‘growed.’.

Sweet Marie, she loves just me (She also loves Maurice McGhee). No she don’t, she loves just me (She also loves Louise Dupree). No she don’t, she loves just me (She also loves the willow tree). No she don’t, she loves just me! (Poor, poor fool, why can’t you see She can love others and still love thee.).

Standing on my elbow With my finger in my ear, Biting on a dandelion. And humming kind of queer While I watched a yellow caterpillar Creeping up my wrist, I leaned on a tree And I said to me, “Why am I doing this?”.

I’m Reginald Clark, I’m afraid of the dark So I always insist on the light on, And my teddy to hug. And my blanket to rub. And my thumby to suck or to bite on. And three bedtime stories. Two trips to the toilet. Two prayers, and five hugs from my mommy, I’m Reginald Clark, I’m afraid of the dark So please do not close this book on me.

# Save the Cat! Writes a Novel (Jessica Brody)

The word “plot” on its own is pretty useless. It’s just a series of events that happen in a story.

But structure is the order in which those events happen and, maybe even more importantly, the timing of when they happen. Then you add in a character who needs to change and does change by the end, and.

But structure is the order in which those events happen and, maybe even more importantly, the timing of when they happen. Then you add in a character who needs to change and does change by the end, and presto! You’ve got a story worth telling.

How do you create a hero who is interesting, memorable, and relatable, a hero whom readers want to read about? A hero worthy of an entire novel written about them?.

That’s why it shouldn’t be easy for your hero to get what they want. It should be hard. They should have to work for.

That’s why it shouldn’t be easy for your hero to get what they want. It should be hard. They should have to work for it.

If it was easy for yout hero to get what they wanted, then there is no story to be told about that hero of yours.

Louisa in Me Before You by Jojo Moyes goes from just wanting a job to help provide for her family to wanting to save Will’s life.

When a hero wants something, it sets them in motion. It gets them off their butt and into the action, which is exactly where we want them to be!.

When really these wants are just Band-Aids covering a deeper problem.

# All The Lonely People (Mike Gayle)

It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams.

It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams. But there were moments, usually when he least expected, when he felt her absence so intensely he could barely draw breath.

‘Now tell me, girl, why does a fancy, la-di-dah academic like you want to know what a boring old man like me has been doing with his days? You a glutton for punishment?’.

‘Oh, Dad,’ chided Rose, ‘what are you like? You really should take an interest in your friends, you know. They’re good for your health. I came across a very interesting study the other day that said people with a small group of good friends are more likely to live longer.’.

‘Will you give it a try?’ Hubert had his reservations but Rose was someone he simply couldn’t say no to.

‘Hubert,’ she would say, ‘you need to spend less time fixing on the problem and more time working out what you’re going to do about it!’ And as he lay there in bed it occurred to him that she was right. Lying around feeling sorry for himself wasn’t going to sort anything out. What he needed was a solution to his current predicament. A way forward. A plan.

‘He’s been such a good friend to me and me hate the idea of him ending up alone.’.

When you don’t see someone regularly you imagine them carrying on their lives as they’d always done from one year to the next but the truth was things changed.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

In fact, soon Hubert began to quantify how good or bad a day was simply by the quality and quantity of interactions he had with Joyce.

Believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce.

But in a short space of time he went from believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce would go out with him to becoming convinced that if he just said the right thing in the right way and looked handsome and debonair while doing it, he might be in with a chance.

‘I’ve got a question for you … What are you doing Saturday night?’ Hubert stared at her confused. ‘Me … me … got no plans.’ ‘Good,’ she replied. ‘In that case you’re taking me to the five o’clock showing of South Pacific at the Regal in Blackfriars.’ Hubert stood frozen to the spot, speechless. A wry smile played on Joyce’s lips. ‘What? You haven’t seen it already, have you?’ Even if he had, twenty times, he would gladly see it twenty times more if it meant going with her. ‘No, me haven’t seen it.’ ‘Good,’ said Joyce. ‘Then I’ll meet you outside the Regal at four thirty so we can chat before the film.’.

He grinned in the lift on the way back down to the warehouse. He grinned as he passed Mr Coulthard yelling at the new lads. And he grinned all the more later when Kenneth told him a very odd story about being sent on a wild-goose chase to the fourth floor by a girl from haberdashery.

‘Of course I do,’ said Ashleigh. ‘And yes, I know sometimes the world’s a horrible place but not always. Sometimes it’s a lovely place where nice things happen for no reason and I’d much rather …’ She began to get upset. ‘… I’d much rather live in that world than the other one!’.

It was a kiss that didn’t so much say goodbye as hello.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy. At the time he had thought the idea nonsense – how could the man ever be happy knowing that he’d never be with his girl again? – but in this moment Hubert finally understood the character’s motivation. In this moment he knew that he too would do anything, absolutely anything to prevent his girl from enduring pain no matter what the cost to himself.

‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’.

‘Me tried to read one once,’ confessed Hubert, ‘but me didn’t get very far. Couldn’t make head nor tail of it!’ As Ashleigh flicked through one of the books, Hubert pointed out the dedication inside, which read, ‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’ Hubert laughed. ‘That’s the one part of this book me never get tired of reading!’.

‘Me think your daughter will be whatever she wants to be,’.

‘Joyce Anne Pierce, would you do me the honour of being my wife? And not because of the baby, and not because you have nowhere else to go, but because me don’t want to waste another single minute without you.’.

When.

Sajjan: 3284.

The moment it had dawned on him that he wasn’t an island. That, in spite of himself, he missed the company of other human beings. No, he wasn’t really in the mood for cake, company or conversation but he had to acknowledge that this was something he needed, even if it wasn’t necessarily what he wanted.

It was meant to be a thankyou not a death threat.

What is it them always say? It’s the thought that counts.’.

“Sometimes the best way to get to know a new place is to get lost in it.”’.

‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

‘Joyce, you know you can’t pick a fight with everyone who has something to say about us, don’t you?’ ‘I know,’ she whispered in the darkness. ‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

Joyce bit her lip. Sometimes she was so ashamed of this country she called home, she could cry.

‘I bet you wish you’d never come sometimes.’ Hubert fell silent, clearly struggling with his answer. ‘If me being honest me do sometimes,’ he said eventually. ‘But then me think about you and Rose, and the wonderful life we’re going to have together and me say to myself, “Hubert Bird, what are you talking about? You is the luckiest man alive.”’.

‘It will be my way of saying thank you to you, Mr Hubert, for your kindness with the pineapple juice.’.

‘If anybody had tried to steal my Joyce on our wedding day, me would’ve boxed them ears!’.

‘The days ain’t half long sometimes when you’re on your own,’.

‘You needn’t look so worried!’ teased Jan. ‘I’m done with romance, Hubert. All I need these days are my soaps, a good murder mystery to curl up with on a rainy day and some quality company every now and again. So what do you say?’.

‘Smiler, you know me, I’m not the settling kind. I don’t like to be boxed in and it felt like everything Lois was doing was about building a great big box to keep me in.’.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom? Gus had been happy with Lois, that was.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom?.

Gus had spoken about it as if it was a trap but Hubert didn’t feel trapped at all.

Before he knew what he was doing, Hubert was on his feet too, taking Joyce’s hand and holding it tightly in his. As he met the gaze of first Joyce’s father and then each of her brothers, Hubert told himself he was ready for whatever happened next. As far as he was concerned, his wife’s battles were his and that was just the way it was and would always be.

Hubert pulled out his handkerchief and wiped away sweat both real and imaginary.

Though she might not be here any more, Joyce was still his girl.

‘Well, if you’re really not interested in her that way, Hubert, then make sure you’re totally honest with her, because one thing you’ve got to know about us ladies is that we’re eternal optimists!’.

‘Kids,’ she said, spearing a new potato on her fork and dipping it into the salad cream, ‘you raise them the best you can, make all the sacrifices in the world, give them all the love in the universe and all they do is break your heart.’.

The world is moving so fast and no one’s got time to stop these days. It’s sad really. I read a thing in the paper last week while I was having my break at work. Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

‘There are so many lonely people around these days,’ she said. ‘I see it at the vet’s all the time: old dears whose only friend in the world is their pet and who want nothing more than a little chat when they pop in for worming medicine or whatever. The world is moving so fast and no one’s got time to stop these days. It’s sad really. I read a thing in the paper last week while I was having my break at work. Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

Then, holding the bouquet out over the water, he released his grip and as it fell through the air then finally into the river below, Hubert thought about Joyce, their life together and how, even now, nearly thirteen years on, he still missed her with every fibre of his being.

Distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

With her eyes still closed, she reached over and took his hand and together they listened to the sounds of the children playing, of the sparrows chirping in the holly bush behind them, of the distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

Sometimes, as his Joyce used to say, instead of waiting around for somebody else to do something, you have to be that person. Sometimes you just have to go big or go home.

How could his two babies both look so grown up when it had only been yesterday that they would crawl into his lap to watch TV? It didn’t seem possible, and yet here he was, about to set one of them on a journey that would take her who knew where? Time seemed to be racing past, the clock ticking two beats for every one, and Hubert sometimes felt like he couldn’t keep up. Before he knew it, David would be leaving too, whether to university as Hubert hoped, or off pursuing dreams of his own, and then it would be just him and Joyce again, like it had been in the early days. But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person.

But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person. He wasn’t that young man any more and Joyce wasn’t that young woman. They were different, they were parents and had been for so long now that it was almost impossible to conceive of a life when they were anything else.

It was only when he and Jan were in place that it occurred to Hubert just how nervous he was about facing the general public. After all, it was one thing to pass the time of day with someone, but it was quite another to attempt to recruit them into volunteering their time and commitment.

Some people are like sun. They are admired when they come and when they go. You spend the rest of the time avoiding them, looking for some shade. But some people are like moon. You don't take notice of the time when they come. And like moon, they have an habit of disappearing in the lovely night. Every time they come, they are a little different. They are not the brightest, in fact the shine they carry is not even their own, they only reflect. However, you can spend the entire night fathoming their beauty. And entire day longing their company. Some people are the moon of our life.

‘I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that she’s my baby girl and nobody, not even Prince Charles himself, is going to be good enough for her.’.

‘Well, tough, you shouldn’t have been so greedy and eaten your lunch as a mid-morning snack!’.

There was another long, awkward pause, then Jan said, ‘Hubert, I don’t mean to pry but about earlier … you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to. But I just want you to know that if you need to talk, I’m here to listen.’.

‘I’m Zara, and I’ll be doing your make-up this morning. Not that there’s a lot to do. You have the most amazing skin and cheekbones to die for! Anyway, take a seat and I’ll give you a quick powder.’.

It was the not knowing that was the most painful thing, the hope sometimes as painful as the despair.

‘Me love you from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and what’s more, me always will.’.

‘It’s easy to waste a lot of time trying to think of a perfect solution to a problem. But sometimes the only thing you can do is cross your fingers and have a go.’.

“Smiler, this damn tea so weak it nearly a fortnight!”.

Each time he had been to see Gus before now, he had come wanting something from his friend: the first to renew their friendship for Rose’s sake and the second to find out what had gone so wrong in his old friend’s life. This time around he wanted it to be different: he didn’t want anything from Gus other than to share a meal and remember the old days. Hubert had been prepared to sit in silence while Gus ignored both him and the food. This then was a pleasant surprise, a glimmer of how they used to be and, he hoped, a spark that might reignite the fire of their friendship.

At the time of their wedding, lots of people had doubted whether the marriage would last, the odds being so stacked against them, but what they didn’t know, what they couldn’t know unless they were in Hubert and Joyce’s shoes, was that even though they had been married in a down-at-heel register office in Brixton rather than a fancy church, even though there had been no big wedding party, no lavish gifts, no honeymoon, they had meant every single word of their vows: ‘For better for worse … in sickness and in health, ’til death us do part.’.

One lot break into your house and the other suck the money straight from your bank account!.

She left the room, leaving Hubert to consider the future. No more pantomime with the telephone, no more Rose, no more fooling himself that his life was anything other than what it was: day after day of emptiness. His mind flicked back to that moment with Jan and the kiss they’d shared, a moment that now seemed to belong to another time.

Anyway, avoiding people was easy once you learned how, and with every day that passed it seemed to be getting easier.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’ ‘Me know. And me didn’t exactly make it easy for you and for that me sorry. You of all people didn’t deserve to be shut out like that.’.

Now that she had recovered herself, there was an unmistakable frostiness in her tone.

‘Jan,’ began Hubert, ‘you have every right to be upset. You’ve been nothing but a friend to me and me have behave … well, it can’t have been nice for you.’ ‘You mean worrying about you day and night?’ said Jan. ‘You mean going over and over everything I’d said and done? You mean knocking on your door, calling you, even writing letters only to be completely ignored? No, it wasn’t nice. It wasn’t nice at all.’.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort her.’.

‘Oh, Hubert. Of course it’s possible. I don’t think I could ever be angry with you for any length of time.

‘No, you don’t,’ said Hubert. ‘Until me met you, me hadn’t even given romance a second thought. Why would me do that, when lightning never strikes in the same place twice? But then me got to know you, and me spend time in your company and well … all me can say is that you, Jan, you is a mighty fine woman, and me wish with me whole heart that me could be saying that me want us to be together.

‘Oh Hubert, the important thing is that you don’t have to go through anything alone any more. You’ve got Ashleigh and Layla, you’ve got your friend Gus back on the scene, you’ve got all the committee, and last but not least, you’ve got a friend in me for life, if nothing else.’.

‘You see, the key to helping other people out of them loneliness is nothing more difficult than good old-fashioned perseverance. It’s not always easy, me know that, but you’ve got to be willing to keep doors open, to carry on trying even if it doesn’t look like it’s working. You’ve got to refuse to give up on people, even if them given up on themselves.’ He paused again, reflecting on just how lonely he’d been all those years, how cut off from the rest of the world.

‘And that’s the funny thing about life. Extraordinary things can happen to ordinary people like you and me, but only if we open ourselves up enough to let them.’.

In fact, to choose to continue living was to honour the memory of those he had loved and lost, a celebration of the life they had once shared.


# The Midnight Library (Matt Haig)

It was hard not to compare Mrs Elm to her mother, who treated Nora like a mistake in need of correction.

Even on days when it wasn’t raining she would spend her afternoon break in the small library.

‘Dad thinks I’ve thrown everything away. Now I’ve stopped swimming.’.

‘Well, far be it from me to say, but there is more to this world than swimming really fast.

But she’d been feeling lonely. And though she’d studied enough existential philosophy to believe loneliness was a fundamental part of being a human in an essentially meaningless universe, it was good to see him.

Great. I was thinking of doing a half-marathon and then I remembered I hate running.’.

As if he was Confucius contemplating a deep philosophical truth about the universe rather than the boss of a musical equipment shop dealing with a late employee.

‘So, what happened?’ She gave the short version. ‘It was a lot of pressure.’ ‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’.

‘So, what happened?’ She gave the short version. ‘It was a lot of pressure.’ ‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ She didn’t correct his knowledge of diamonds. She didn’t tell him that while coal and diamonds are both carbon, coal is too impure to be able, under whatever pressure, to become a diamond. According to science, you start off as coal and you end up as coal. Maybe that was the real-life lesson.

‘I’m afraid, Nora’ – he paused for a moment, about the time it takes to lift an axe into the air – ‘I’m going to have to let you go.’.

The town was a conveyor belt of despair.

The universe tended towards chaos and entropy. That was basic thermodynamics. Maybe it was basic existence too.

‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’.

As Nora escaped the shop, she wished there were nothing but doors ahead of her, which she could walk through one by one, leaving everything behind.

‘Cheer up, love, it might never happen,’ someone said.

She was a waterfall of apologies. She was drowning in herself.

And on the subject of summer lawns: despite the fact that the books looked old, the air in the library felt fresh.

Mrs Elm had held her, stroking and smoothing the back of her head like a baby, not offering platitudes or false comforts or anything other than concern.

‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’.

Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed.

An unfinished jigsaw of a human.

‘Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can’t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try . . . But you are no longer within a lifetime. You have popped outside. This is your opportunity, Nora, to see how things could be.’.

Still staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person.

Still staring blankly at The Book of Regrets, she wondered if her parents had ever been in love or if they had got married because marriage was something you did at the appropriate time with the nearest available person. A game where you grabbed the first person you could find when the music stopped.

‘To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three-parts dead’.

If you have found a life you truly want to live, then you get to live it until you die of old age.

This was a life where she put four exclamation marks in a row. That was probably what happier, less uptight people did.

‘Dan,’ she said, as if he was something that needed identifying.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but.

A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.

Nothing that dramatic. But after Izzy had gone to Australia, things had faded between them until their friendship became just a vapour trail of sporadic Facebook and Instagram likes and emoji-filled birthday messages.

Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories.

At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories.

‘And have you never walked into a room and wondered what you came in for? Have you never forgotten what you just did? Have you never blanked out or misremembered what you were just doing?’.

Maybe you have a lack problem rather than a want problem.

‘So, you see? Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . .’ She searched for the appropriate term and found it. ‘A load of bullshit.’.

And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness?.

She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness?.

Nora understood this. She thought of a study she had read about somewhere, about fish. Fish were more like humans than most people think. Fish get depression. They had done tests with zebrafish. They had a fish tank and they drew a horizontal line on the side of it, halfway down, in marker pen. Depressed fish stayed below the line. But give those same fish Prozac and they go above the line, to the top of their tanks, darting about like new.

But give those same fish Prozac and they go above the line, to the top of their tanks, darting about like new. Fish get depressed when they have a lack of stimulation. A lack of everything. When they are just there, floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all.

Maybe even suicide would have been too active. Maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don’t even try to change. Maybe that was most lives.

‘Yes,’ said Nora, aloud now. ‘Maybe I got stuck. Maybe in every life I am stuck. I mean, maybe that’s just who I am. A starfish in every life is still a starfish. There isn’t a life where a starfish is a professor of aerospace engineering. And maybe there isn’t a life where I’m not stuck.’.

A starfish in every life is still a starfish.

When we first fell in love we didn't have to tell that we love each other. Suddenly in our busy lives there was time we had for each other. Maybe all the time we had, we had for each other. Even when we were not together, we kept each other in thoughts. Life was always hard to be lived alone, but when we fell in love, we told each other, "don't be sacred, I'm there", we didn't say it out loud, we made sure that the other one felt that way..

There is a reason why people make friends who are different then they are. If people loved their own company so much, they would have befriended the mirror.

‘Librarians have knowledge. They guide you to the right books. The right worlds. They find the best places. Like soul-enhanced search engines.’.

‘For someone who has read a lot of books, you aren’t very specific with your choice of words.’.

From that moment in that car park she had felt she was really just an extension of the pain in his left knee. A walking wound.

‘The rook is my favourite piece,’ she said. ‘It’s the one that you think you don’t have to watch out for. It is straightforward. You keep your eye on the queen, and the knights, and the bishop, because they are the sneaky ones. But it’s the rook that often gets you. The straightforward is never quite what it seems.’.

‘Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.’.

Henry David Thoreau.

It was cold. Properly cold. The cold that almost burns, that hurts your fingers and toes and stiffens your cheeks.

His troublesome soul lingered on every street . . . I kept telling his memory to piss the fuck off but it wouldn’t. Grief is a bastard.

But the truth is, it only half-works, you know? Places are places and memories are memories and life is fucking life.’.

This must be the hardest bit about being a spy, she thought. The emotion people store in you, like a bad investment. You feel like you are robbing people of something.

‘If one advances confidently,’ Thoreau had written in Walden, ‘in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.’ He’d also observed that part of this success was the product of being alone. ‘I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.’.

‘That’s why everyone hates each other nowadays,’ he reckoned. ‘Because they are overloaded with non-friend friends. Ever heard about Dunbar’s number?’.

And that was the problem. In the face of death, life seemed more attractive, and as life seemed more attractive, how could she get back to the Midnight Library? She had to be disappointed in a life, not just scared of it, in order to try again with another book.

Every mistake she had ever made. Every mark on her body. Every dream she hadn’t reached or pain she had felt. Every lust or longing she had suppressed.

She imagined, now, what it would be like to accept herself completely. Every mistake she had ever made. Every mark on her body. Every dream she hadn’t reached or pain she had felt. Every lust or longing she had suppressed.

‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’.

‘But what about us? We’re doing.

I'm writting a rhyme,
don't raise expectations,
I am short on time. 
But there is a story,
that needs to be told,
Kishan has committed a crime,
But hold,
Before I tell you all about that,
there is something you should know
before santa is back.
Soon it will be midnight,
And the clock will welcome the new day with folded hands,
Cricket, they will play their sound,
Standby boat will call to say, 'me kab aau?'
And there will be a cc, or maybe a vc,
and the crane will dance.
Raksha might call, Rasha has no chance.
There will be flute music in the air,
And uk lily will sing,
Nosey will try to say something,
But Jeeru will cut him in between,
Kishan has committed a crime,
And that's the agenda prime.
A.

‘You’re overthinking this, Nora,’ said Ravi. ‘I have no other type of thinking available.’.

She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.

All good things are wild and free.

A message from Izzy.

It seems impossible to live without hurting people.’.

‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’.

‘Compassion is the basis of morality,’ the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer had written, in one of his softer moments. Maybe it was the basis of life too.

Each life she had experienced had a different feeling, like different movements in a symphony, and this one felt quite bold and uplifting. Eduardo was incredibly sweet-natured, and their marriage seemed to be a successful one.

She had known three types of silence in relationships. There was passive-aggressive silence, obviously, there was the we-no-longer-have-anything-to-say silence, and then there was the silence that Eduardo and she seemed to have cultivated. The silence of not needing to talk. Of just being together, of together-being. The way you could be happily silent with yourself.

You didn’t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.

You didn’t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed. Equally, enjoying a life didn’t mean you stayed in that life. You only stayed in a life for ever if you couldn’t imagine a better one, and yet, paradoxically, the more lives you tried the easier it became to think of something better, as the imagination broadened a bit more with every new life she sampled.

Single moment could contain both intense pleasure and intense pain, as if both were dependent on each other, like a pendulum in motion. A simple walk outside and she could feel a heavy sadness simply because the sun had slipped behind a cloud.

Single moment could contain both intense pleasure and intense pain, as if both were dependent on each other, like a pendulum in motion. A simple walk outside and she could feel a heavy sadness simply because the sun had slipped behind a cloud. Yet, conversely, meeting a dog who was clearly grateful for her attention caused her to feel so exultant that she felt she could melt into the pavement with sheer bliss. In that life she had a book of Emily Dickinson poems beside her bed and she had a playlist called ‘Extreme States of Euphoria’ and another one called ‘The Glue to Fix Me When I Am Broken’.

In one life she spent all day arguing with people she didn’t know on Twitter and ended a fair proportion of her tweets by saying ‘Do better’ while secretly realising she was telling herself to do that.

‘You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’.

“It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”’.

‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’.

She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’ And Ash only saw the Nora he had fallen in love with and married, and so, in a way, that was the Nora she was becoming.

‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’.

We don’t have to play every game to know what winning feels like.

We don’t have to play every game to know what winning feels like. We don’t have to hear every piece of music in the world to understand music. We don’t have to have tried every variety of grape from every vineyard to know the pleasure of wine. Love and laughter.

It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from.

The paradox of volcanoes was that they were symbols of destruction but also life. Once the lava slows and cools, it solidifies and then breaks down over time to become soil – rich, fertile soil.

She wasn’t a black hole, she decided. She was a volcano. And like a volcano she couldn’t run away from herself. She’d have to stay there and tend to that wasteland. She could plant a forest inside herself.


# I Will Not Die an Unlived Life: Reclaiming Purpose and Passion (Dawna Markova)

When I was ten, I read about Helen Keller and Joan of Arc and Wonder Woman, and for a few years I believed that if I did what my heart told me to do, I could help create less suffering in the world, and maybe even a little more joy. When people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I told them I wanted to make the world a better place.


# No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness (Michelle Segar)

I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

One day after school, when I was at odds with myself and the world, I decided to put on my sneakers and jog around the neighborhood. I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

Although I’ve always enjoyed running, I really love to walk. I rely on walking not only to nourish my body but also to clear my mind.

My interdisciplinary research challenges the status quo within the health promotion and healthcare industries by showing that logical rewards like “health” and “weight loss” do not motivate people to sustain health-related behavior as well as immediate and emotional rewards such as “well-being.”.

Yet the secret to achieving sustainable self-perpetual behavior change lies precisely in understanding how to create goals, motivation, and behavior that reflect what is most aligned with and meaningful to our sense of self.

No Sweat is written for individuals looking for real and sustainable ways to feel better, live better, and become happier, healthier, and fit.

Some personal projects may be focused on achievement (for example, learning to play the piano) or obtaining something (getting that promotion). Other personal projects focus on the process (spending time with your family, being a better parent, trying to relax more). They may be things you choose to do (read a book for pleasure), things you have to do (get your teeth cleaned, find a second job), things you are working toward (that trip to the Galapagos, learning to control your temper), or things you are trying to avoid (going into debt, fighting with your partner).


# What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky (Lesley Nneka Arimah)

His stepmother regards him as one would a stray dog that comes by often enough that she knows its face, but she’ll be.


# The Sicilian (Mario Puzo)

Though he was smiling, it was a face that made you dream of murder.

Don Croce immediately led him into the garden, for like all Sicilians he ate his meals out of doors when he could.

He drove carefully and slowly, as men do who have learned to drive motor vehicles late in life.

Michael thought, What the hell was the man saying? Why couldn't he get a straight answer from any of them? Because this was Sicily, he thought. Sicilians had a horror of truth. Tyrants and Inquisitors had tortured them for the truth over thousands of years. The government in Rome with its legal forms demanded the truth. The priest in the confessional box commanded the truth under pain of everlasting hell. But truth was a source of power, a lever of control, why should anyone give it away?.

He aims a gun forward and slaughters his friend by his side.

"Tell the truth, all Sicilians prefer smelling the shit of their villages to the best perfumes in Paris. What am I doing here? I could have escaped to Brazil like some others. Ah, we love where we are born, we Sicilians, but Sicily does not love us.".

He always had such grand ideas, he always talked of justice. A true Sicilian talks of bread.".

In his first days as an outlaw he looked down from the mountains but could not see. And I looked up and could not see. But we felt each other's presence, each other's love.

The girl could go, she was bound only by love, not by blood.

There were a hundred children for each olive that fell to the ground, and these children were like locusts.

"What a nuisance life is. I have work to do on my land and yet when my neighbor asked me to do this little favor, how could I refuse? My father knew his father, my grandfather his grandfather. And it is my nature, perhaps my misfortune that I will do anything a friend asks me to do. After all, are we not Christians together?".

In the street Turi Guiliano felt his moodiness fade with the sheer beauty of the day. The golden sun was glorious, the smell of lemon and olive trees filled the air. He loved the town of Montelepre, its crooked streets, the stone houses with their balconies filled with those gaudy flowers that grew in Sicily without the slightest encouragement.

"If we could all live like donkeys, eh, what a life.".

"These are hard times," he said to Guiliano. "The promised reward of heaven is too far away, men must have some pleasure now. God will forgive them.".

Don Croce had never believed in the divine right of kings, indeed he asserted that no reasonable human being had ever believed in it except when the alternative was being torn apart by four wild horses.

Don Croce indignantly boasted that he had never used torture of any kind. Simple murder sufficed.

For Don Croce believed that greediness was the greatest of all human failings, and he shared his profits freely. He was more.

It was bad enough to be an outlaw, but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous. "That's.

It was bad enough to be an outlaw, but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous.

When did the dreams of heroes begin, if not when sitting in a lonely glen, talking to dear friends.

And his godson would be another of these heroes, not understanding that for Sicily to change, there would have to be a moral volcano that would incinerate the land.

A belief in one's own virtue is far more dangerous than a belief in one's cunning.

Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta.

They were best friends and they were the center of each other's universe. Their friendship revolved around the fact that they were there, not only when they needed each other, but also when they did not.

Man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

"A man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

For say what you would of a Sicilian: that they were born criminals, that they murdered as easily as a woman picks flowers, that they were as cunningly treacherous as Turks, that they were socially three hundred years behind the times; yet no one could dispute that Sicilians loved, no, they idolized children.

Even a Member of Parliament was called Honorable to his face though everyone knew these rascals were greater thieves than anyone.

Guiliano laughed and the Prince was charmed by that youthful laugh, the boyish handsomeness of his face. But with Guiliano's answer the charm vanished. "Your government has set a price of ten million lire on my head. It would be an insult to Your Lordship if the ransom were not ten times as high." The Prince was stunned then said ironically, "I hope my family thinks as highly of me as you do.".

"Do you really care so much for what you wear on the outside of your skin?".

And this was not uncommon in Italy. The lower classes were treated cruelly only when they fought for their economic rights.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me. And.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me.

There could not therefore be any doubt that they would become lovers, for no Sicilian believed that any male and female alone together, no matter what difference in age, could refrain.

"I'll take you to Guiliano, but keep your lupare.

But not the secrets Guiliano ordered him not to tell.

Writing a poem is easy
Writing a song is hard,
With song you need music,
And somone might have to dance.

Making a friend is easy,
Being a friend is hard,
For making you only need meeting,
For being you need to keep them in heart, even when apart.

The Fiat skirted the.

In a corner of the garden, beneath a lemon tree, was an oval wooden table with rustic wooden chairs around.

'Don't reproach your two beautiful children who will be the pleasure and comfort of your old age. The money I have given them is far greater than you have lost. And know this: From today on, you and your children are under the protection of GUILIANO.'.

"But what made me love him was the pleasure he received in doing a good deed. He was really delighted to help someone else. That never changed. I always saw the same pleasure, as if he gained more from the giving than they did from the taking. That is why the people of Sicily love him.".

Pisciotta was a man who could never trust anyone completely and was therefore a man who by definition could not be trusted by anyone completely.

Waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as.

"Let's talk Sicilian together," the Don said gravely. "When we are children, when we are young, it is natural to love our friends, to be generous to them, to forgive their faults. Each day is fresh, we look forward to the future with pleasure and without fear. The world itself is not so dangerous; it is a happy time. But as we grow old and have to earn our bread, friendship does not endure so easily. We must always be on our guard. Our elders no longer look after us, we are no longer content with those simple pleasures of children. Pride grows in us – we wish to become great or powerful or rich, or simply to guard ourself against misfortune. I know how much you love Turi Guiliano, but now you must ask yourself, what is the price of this love? And after all these years does it still exist or is it just the memory that exists?" He waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as white. For Pisciotta's face had gone very pale.

"You warned me about his attack on my hotel. That was an act of friendship?".

"That is Sicily," the Don said. "There is always treachery within treachery.".

It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

For the first time the Don showed annoyance. He poured himself another glass of anisette and drank it down. He pointed a finger at his son. "You wanted to learn," he said. "Now listen to me. A man's first duty is to keep himself alive. Then comes what everyone calls honor. This dishonor, as you call it, I willingly take upon myself. I did it to save your life as you once took on dishonor to save mine. You would never have left Sicily alive without Don Croce's protection. So be it. Do you want to be a hero like Guiliano, a legend? And dead? I love him as the son of my dear friends, but I do not envy him his fame. You are alive and he is dead. Always remember that and live your life not to be a hero but to remain alive. With time, heroes seem a little foolish." Michael sighed. "Guiliano had no choice," he said. "We are more fortunate," the Don said. It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

When they are free they abuse their health – they smoke to excess, they drink to drunkenness, they fornicate to exhaustion. They don't sleep enough or get enough exercise. Then when they have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, they do push-ups, they spurn tobacco, they watch their diet and are moderate in all things.".

The piece of paper Hector Adonis had slipped inside Aspanu's shirt read so die all who betray guiliano.

Ah, Sicily, Sicily, he thought, you destroy your best and bring them to dust. Children more beautiful than the angels spring from your earth and turn into demons. The evil flourish in this soil like the bamboo and the prickly pear. And yet why was Don Croce here to lay flowers at Guiliano's grave?.

By remaining faithful, Pisciotta would have been forgotten, Guiliano would fill the legend alone. But by committing his great crime, he would stand alongside his beloved Turi forever.

Pisciotta would be buried in this same cemetery. The two of them would gaze forever at their cherished mountains, those same mountains that held the skeleton of Hannibal's elephant, that once echoed with the great blasts of Roland's horn when he died fighting the Saracens. Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta had died young, but they would live, if not forever, certainly longer than Don Croce or himself, Professor Hector Adonis.


# The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War (Ben MacIntyre)

The spy was being spied upon by his fellow spies.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it. The Soviet spy service was in his heart.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it.

“Better that ten innocent people should suffer than one spy get away,” said Nikolai Yezhov, chief of the NKVD.

NKVD, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Stalin’s secret police and the precursor of the KGB.

“The NKVD is always right,” he said: a conclusion both wholly sensible and entirely wrong.

The elder Gordievsky was a prime example of the species Homo Sovieticus, an obedient state servant forged by Communist repression. But underneath he was fearful, horrified, and perhaps gnawed by guilt. Oleg later came to see his father as “a frightened man.”.

From boyhood, Oleg saw that it was possible to live a double life, to love those around you while concealing your true inner self, to appear to be one person to the external world and quite another inside.

For hours he would run, through Moscow’s streets and parks, alone with his thoughts.

“Only a physical barrier, reinforced by armed guards in their watchtowers, could keep the East Germans in their socialist paradise and stop them fleeing to the West.”.

“It was I, rather than she, who was being tested.”.

“ashamed of all those crimes and atrocities committed by the KGB, and simply afraid to discuss the work of the KGB with his own son.”.

.

The KGB’s “Red Banner” elite training academy, deep in the woods fifty miles north of Moscow, was code-named School 101, an ironic and entirely unconscious echo of George Orwell’s Room 101 in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the basement torture chamber where the Party breaks a prisoner’s resistance by subjecting him to his worst nightmare.

Gordievsky adopted his first spy name. Soviet and Western intelligence services used the same method for choosing a pseudonym—it should be close to the real name, with the same initial letter, because that way if a person addressed you by your real name, someone who only knew you by your spy name might well assume he or she had misheard. Gordievsky chose the name “Guardiyetsev.”.

There was calculation as well as control in this: a married KGB officer was considered less likely to defect while abroad, since his wife and family could be held as hostages.

Oleg was rejected for illegals work: according to KGB logic, having more than one family member abroad, and particularly having two in the same country, might be an inducement to defect.

There was a very good reason, he reflected, why ordinary Soviet citizens were not permitted to travel abroad: who but a fully indoctrinated KGB officer would be able to taste such freedoms and resist the urge to stay?.

The rezident, Leonid Zaitsev, a charming and conscientious officer, seemed oblivious to the fact that most of his underlings were incompetent, lazy, or crooked, and usually all three. They expended far more energy on fiddling their expenses than actually spying.

The broad remit of the KGB was to cultivate Danish contacts, recruit informants, and target possible agents. This, Gordievsky swiftly realized, was “an invitation to corruption,” since most officers simply invented their interactions with Danes, falsified bills, made up their reports, and pocketed their allowances. The Center does not appear to have noticed the anomaly that few of its personnel in Copenhagen spoke good Danish, and some spoke none at all.

He spoke English with a fruity upper-class accent, larded with old-fashioned Britishisms (What ho! Pip pip!), making him sound like a Russian Bertie Wooster.

He attended classical-music concerts, devoured library books, and traveled to every corner of Denmark, sometimes on spy business, but mostly for the sheer pleasure of being able to do so.

To work off his frustration, he ran every day in Copenhagen’s parks, alone, for hour after hour, returning home too exhausted to quarrel.

The Prague Spring was over, and a new Soviet winter began.

Englishman, a cheerful, back-slapping fellow who referred to the people he liked as “complete darlings” and those he did not as “prize shits.”.

Richard Bromhead was one of those Englishmen who put a great deal of effort into appearing to be a lot stupider than they really are. He was a formidable intelligence officer.

(the grease that oils the wheels of so much espionage),.

One of the oldest gambits in intelligence is “the dangle,” when one side appears to make a play for someone on the other, lures him into complicity, and gains his trust, before exposing him.

Here, finally, was the hint of collusion—not a flash of leg exactly, but the glimpse of an ankle.

In spying, as in love, a little distance, a little uncertainty, an apparent cooling on one side or the other can stimulate desire.

“Search for people who are hurt by fate or nature—the ugly, those suffering from an inferiority complex, craving power and influence but defeated by unfavorable circumstances….In cooperation with us, all these find a peculiar compensation. The sense of belonging to an influential and powerful organization will give them a feeling of superiority over the handsome and prosperous people around them.”.

“Intelligence agents, in my experience, are even bigger liars than journalists.”.

A degree of intellectual snobbery is common to most, the secret sense of knowing important things unknown to the person standing next to you at the bus stop. In part, spying is an act of the imagination.

Oleg Penkovsky, the Russian spy who furnished the West with crucial intelligence during the Cuban Missile Crisis, hoped to prevent nuclear war, but he also wanted prostitutes and chocolates brought to his London hotel, and demanded to meet the Queen.

He was looking for revenge, for fulfillment, but also for love.

Spies want to feel wanted, part of a secret community, rewarded, trusted, and cherished.

“a marvellous man…[who] looked at you as if nothing more important in life than you and talking to you existed at that moment.”.

The Russian euphemism for the summary death sentence was vyshaya mera, “highest measure”: the traitor was taken into a room, made to kneel, and then shot in the back of the head. Sometimes the KGB was more imaginative. It was said that Penkovsky had been cremated alive and his death filmed, as a warning to potential turncoats.

Leila knew from the outset, without ever being told, that Gordievsky was a KGB officer. The thought that his interest in such books might conceal a deeper dissidence never crossed her mind.

Double infidelity with precision and care. Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

The KGB officers in Copenhagen, Oleg explained, spent far more time inventing contacts in order to justify their expenses than actually meeting anyone. This reassuring intelligence was passed on to PET.

During the war, the Hanslope boffins produced an astonishing array of technical gadgets for spies, including secure radios, secret ink, and even garlic-flavored chocolate—issued to spies parachuting into occupied France to ensure their breath smelled convincingly French on landing.

He abandoned his own refusal to reveal names and identified every KGB officer, every illegal, and every source. Finally, he agreed to accept money.

Love often begins with an outpouring of naked truth, a passionate baring of the soul.

The friendship was also a betrayal.

“The purpose of this was twofold: if Oleg just wanted reassurance that we were continuously looking out for his interests, he could see us but not make himself visible. If he wanted to make a brush contact and pass on a physical message, he would make himself visible by means of the gray cap and Safeway bag.”.

Only years after his death did Gordievsky learn that his father had been married before he met Olga, and may have had children by this earlier, hidden marriage. Oleg,.

Only years after his death did Gordievsky learn that his father had been married before he met Olga, and may have had children by this earlier, hidden marriage.

“Real happiness is to queue all night, and then get what you want,”.

Here was further indication that Arne Treholt was an active KGB agent.

“To my good friend Oleg—Don’t believe anything you see in print! Kim Philby.”.

The KGB offered a 10 percent salary increase to officers who passed an official foreign-language course, with a maximum of two languages.

He read Churchill’s History of the Second World War, Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal, and Fielding’s Tom Jones.

The problem with buttering up the boss is that bosses tend to move on, which can mean a lot of wasted butter.

Jack Jones was one of the most respected figures in the trade union movement, a crusading socialist once described by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as “one of the world’s greatest trade union leaders.” He was also a KGB agent.

Lenin is often credited with coining the term “useful idiot,” poleznyi durak in Russian, meaning one who can be used to spread propaganda without being aware of it or subscribing to the goals intended by the manipulator.

His colleagues were convinced Britain would be defeated by plucky little Argentina.

Tall and spare, with thick spectacles and a mustache that never seemed fully confident of itself, he was hard to spot in a group and invisible in a crowd.

He wore a trench coat to look like a spy, and practiced magic tricks. He liked fooling people.

Ames was intelligent and imaginative, but reality never seemed to measure up to his hopes or furnish him with what he considered his just deserts.

“If asked to do something he didn’t want to do, he didn’t argue: he just didn’t do it,”.

“Lying is wrong, son, but if it serves a greater good, it’s OK,”.

Greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

And a greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

Disloyalty was not a sin, but an operational tool.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared. He was wrong: the essence of successful agent running is the maintenance of trust, the supplanting of one allegiance by another, higher, loyalty.

“Remember ’68”—to give the impression that the Turkish population was outraged by the Soviet invasion. He dumped the posters in a bin and went for a drink.

The revelation that Richard Nixon had used the CIA to try to obstruct a federal investigation into the Watergate burglary in 1972 triggered a crisis within the agency and a series of investigations into its activities over the preceding twenty years.

After nearly twenty years in the CIA he understood the workings of the agency, but his career was stagnating, for which he blamed everybody else.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came on.

“She was like a breath of fresh air entering a room stale with cigar smoke,”.

There was nothing special about Ames—and that, perhaps, was the problem.

Paranoia is born of propaganda, ignorance, secrecy, and fear.

The escape plan from Moscow, Operation PIMLICO, would be kept in readiness while he was in London. The KGB was generous in its holiday entitlement, and officers tended to return on annual leave for four weeks in the winter and up to six weeks in the summer. He might also be summoned back at short notice. Whenever he was in Moscow, MI6 officers would continue to check the signal sites at the bread shop on Kutuzovsky Prospekt and the Central Market, looking out for a man with a Safeway bag. They would even do so when the spy was not in the country. The KGB closely watched all British diplomats in Moscow and bugged their apartments, while surveillance posts monitored their movements from the top of the Hotel Ukraine and the roof of the foreigners’ apartment block. Any deviation from routine might be noticed; if they regularly walked past the bread shop when Gordievsky was in Moscow, stopped doing so when he was absent, and started again when he returned, the pattern might just be detected.

But there was one aspect of the Gordievsky trove that made the top brass of British intelligence and security sit up and swallow, hard.

The Kremlin, however, assuming that capitalism penetrated every aspect of Western life, believed that a “blood bank” was, in fact, a bank, where blood could be bought and sold.

In a craven and hierarchical organization, the only thing more dangerous than revealing your own ignorance is to draw attention to the stupidity of the boss.

But obedience was more powerful than common sense in the world of Soviet intelligence, and KGB stations across the world dutifully began searching for evidence of hostile plans.

In spy jargon such information is known as “chicken feed,” genuine but not seriously damaging information that can be given to an enemy to establish an agent’s bona fides, bulky, filling, but lacking in any real nutritional value.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that. He was using her to improve his standing within the KGB. She thought she was striking a blow against the Soviet Union. Here was another example of the combined trickery and tenderness inherent in espionage: a friendship between a British Tory researcher and a Russian Soviet diplomat, both of whom were secret spies. They were lying to each other, with genuine affection.

He would eventually betray the entire CIA spy network inside the Soviet Union, sending many agents to their deaths.

Working out of Deverell’s office, they were sealed off from the rest of MI5 while they dug, a secret cell within a secret department of a secret organization.

A mole does not just foment mistrust. Like a heretic, he undermines the coherence of faith itself.

Storm trooper,”.

Bettaney wanted to know, and conceal, a bigger secret than the spy sitting alongside him.

Felt I needed radically to influence events.” Bettaney did not want money, revolution, or world peace; he wanted attention.

If the marks of potential treachery are being clever, eccentric, and inclined to have a few too many drinks, then half the wartime and postwar spies in Britain and America would have been suspect.

There was a hidden solitude in the heart of his marriage.

“Do they ever ask themselves what is the purpose of life? What is it all for?…No. Their creed is barren of conscience, immune to the promptings of good and evil.”.

The psychological gratification of all intelligence work lies in knowing more than your adversaries, but also more than your allies.

“Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”.

The CIA had won a small but satisfying professional victory over MI6. The Brits thought they knew something the Americans did not know; but now the CIA knew something that MI6 did not know they knew. That is how the game is played. Oleg Gordievsky was assigned the random CIA code name TICKLE, a neutral-sounding label to go with a little harmless international rivalry.

“Everyone has a right to their own strangeness.”.

Ames was truculent. His breath smelled and his job stank. He felt underappreciated by the CIA. But he would later offer a simpler explanation for his actions: “I did it for the money.” He needed to pay for Rosario’s shopping trips to Neiman Marcus and dinners at the Palm restaurant. He wanted to move out of his one-bedroom apartment, pay off his ex-wife, hold an expensive wedding, and own his car outright.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved. Gordievsky had never been interested in the money. Ames was interested in nothing else.

The KGB was a cumbersome beast, but it could move fast when it needed to.

His systematic betrayal of every Soviet agent on the CIA’s books would not take place for another month. In memoirs published in 2005, Cherkashin claimed the crucial tip-off about Gordievsky came not from Ames, but from a shadowy informant, “a Washington-based British journalist.” The CIA dismisses this as disinformation designed to reflect well on the KGB, with “all the earmarks of being a false lead.”.

In the 1980s he had served in East Germany, where one of the KGB officers under his command was the young Vladimir Putin.

He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor.

It is perfectly possible for two people to listen to the same words and hear entirely different things. This was one of those moments. Brown thought he was offering Oleg a way out, while reminding him that this might waste a golden opportunity. Gordievsky believed he was being instructed to return to Moscow. He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor. But Brown, as instructed, gave no such direction. The decision was Gordievsky’s.

“People say that when soldiers hear the artillery start, they go into a sort of panic. That is what happened to me. I could not even remember the escape plan. But then I thought: ‘The plan is unreliable anyway. I should forget about it, and just look forward to the bullet in the back of the neck.’ I was paralyzed.”.

Here he was being accused of treason, and the chief investigator was defending the quality of KGB sandwiches.

When the senior MI6 officer liaising with the MI5 eavesdropping team was asked how the alarm raised by Gordievsky could possibly have been missed, he offered a quotation from Horace: Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus, often translated as “Even Homer nods.” The most highly trained experts can still be caught napping.

Price had been told that the mosquitoes could be fierce on the Russian-Finnish border in early summer. So she bought some mosquito repellent.

The only way husband and wife could communicate at home was by passing notes, in bed, under the sheets. Usually these were written in fountain pen with soluble ink on toilet paper that could then be flushed. “We were under constant watch. There was almost no privacy, ever, anywhere. It was exhausting, and quite stressful.” Even in the embassy, the only place to be sure a conversation was not overheard was the “safe-speech room” in the basement, “a sort of Portakabin surrounded by noise within an empty space.”.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance. He told her nothing, and she believed him.

‘I am your rock,’ I said. ‘Don’t worry. Drink if you want to. I don’t mind.’ ”.

The many perks of KGB membership included access to various health spas and holiday centers.

“All of the people on my June 13 list knew the risks they were taking. If one of them learned about me, he would have told the CIA and I would have been arrested and thrown in jail…It wasn’t personal. It was simply how the game was played.”.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare:.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare: from Nazi Germany to Communist Russia to Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and North Korea today, a willingness to betray those nearest to you for the greater good was the ultimate mark of committed citizenship and ideological purity.

The decision to leave his family behind was either an act of monumental self-sacrifice, or one of selfish self-preservation, or both. He told himself he had no choice, which is what we all tell ourselves when forced to make a terrible choice.

And part of his heart broke.

William Shakespeare has an answer for most of life’s questions. In Hamlet, the greatest writer in the English language pondered the nature of fate and courage, when life’s challenges seem overwhelming. “When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.”.

It was Arthur Gee’s turn to monitor the signal site, but the traffic was slow.

“I drove on, feeling as if the world had fallen in and I had done the wrong thing, for the right reasons.”.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the KGB.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him. And if they did not, the KGB was perfectly capable of sending a Spetsnaz special forces squad to do the job. The Soviets were known to monitor Finnish airports, so simply flying the family out of Helsinki was not an option.

She packed mosquito repellent, clean clothes, and a shaving kit.

She hoped the Moscow team would remember to bring additional spare tires, in good condition, in case of punctures. That, too, was in the escape plan.

“I am quite certain that the prime minister will feel we have an overwhelming moral duty to save this man.”.

“We’ll say it’s a gross provocation. We’ll say they shoved the fellow in the boot of the car.”.

Gordievsky made his preparations, appearing to do the sorts of things a man who was about to escape would not do.

His fate was now back in his own hands.

“Mr. Harrington’s Washing” is the tale of a British spy who escapes from revolutionary Russia through Finland.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

The story is about risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

Whether or not he escaped, the KGB would comb through the transcripts of his telephone conversations afterward, and realize they had been mocked: they would hate him all the more, but perhaps admire him, too.

(“It was so secret I later had a problem getting my expenses reimbursed.”).

The royal courtier fumed. If you are a private secretary, there is nothing more galling than another private secretary being more private than you are.

“She admired him hugely even though it cut against some of her principles—she hated traitors. But he was different. In a different league. She had huge respect for those who stood up to the regime.”.

He did nothing that might seem out of the ordinary, on the most extraordinary day of his life.

Then he ran through the full surveillance-evasion menu, methodically and meticulously: jumping on a Metro train as the door closed, alighting after two stops, waiting for the next train to arrive and then making certain every passenger on the platform had boarded before letting the doors close and catching a train in the opposite direction; ducking down one street, doubling back and up another, into a shop by one entrance and then out of the back.

“A thick mist had risen from the lakes and rivers, extending into long belts beside the hills and through the trees and villages. The land slowly coalesced into substantial forms out of these foaming banks of violet and rose. Three very bright planets shone out in perfect symmetry, one to the left, one to the right, and one straight ahead. We passed solitary figures already scything hay, picking herbs, or taking cows to pasture along the slopes and gullies of common land. It was a stunning sight, an idyllic moment. It was difficult to believe that any harm could come out of a day of such beginnings.”.

In Communist lore, the Finland Station is symbolic of revolutionary liberty and the birth of the Soviet Union; to Gordievsky it also represented the route to freedom, but in the opposite direction, in every sense, to Lenin.

Instead, they seem to have done what timeservers do in every autocracy that punishes honest failure: they did nothing at all, and hoped the problem would go away.

“I felt an extraordinary period of stillness at the center of the turning world,” Simon Brown recalled. He had brought along Hotel du Lac, the Booker Prize–winning novel by Anita Brookner. “I thought if I took a long book it would be tempting fate, so I took a short book.”.

Weekends are lethargic times in all large bureaucracies, when the second-tier staff comes to work and the boss relaxes.

They were playing Finlandia.

Veronica Price did not approve of emotional displays, but she was visibly moved, “her expression a mixture of recognition and love.”.

Gordievsky waved away the sandwiches and fruit juice Price had carefully packed. “I wanted whisky,” he said later. “Why didn’t they give me whisky?” Brown had expected him to be hysterical with exhaustion, but instead Gordievsky seemed “perfectly controlled.”.

Gently raised the question of his family. “It was.

“It was too much of a risk to bring them,” Gordievsky said flatly, and stared out of the window at the passing Finnish countryside.

If the KGB was still watching, they would have noticed that Rachel Gee’s bad back had miraculously recovered.

“Look. Let’s be clear. I was a wife. My job was to clean, cook, shop, sleep with him, have children, share the bed, and be his friend. I was good at it. I’m grateful he didn’t tell me anything. For six years of my life I was a perfect wife. I did everything for him. You, the KGB, you have thousands of people with salaries whose job was to check up on people; they checked him and checked him and cleared him. And you come to me and blame me? Don’t you think that sounds stupid? You didn’t do your job. It wasn’t my job, it was yours. You ruined my life.”.

Among those affected was Vladimir Putin, a product of the Leningrad KGB who saw most of his friends, colleagues, and patrons purged as a direct consequence of Gordievsky’s escape.

From his point of view he was my savior. But who put me in the shit-hole? He’d forgotten the first part. You can’t kick someone off a cliff and then put out a hand and say: ‘I saved you!’ He was so bloody Russian.” Leila could not forget, or get over, what had happened to her. They tried to reassemble a family life, but the marriage that existed before the escape was from another world, another time, and could not be wished back to life.

In the end, she felt Gordievsky’s loyalty to an idea had taken precedence over his love for her.

Ames spied for money; Gordievsky was driven by ideological conviction. Ames’s victims were rooted out by the KGB and, in most cases, killed; the people Gordievsky exposed, such as Bettaney and Treholt, were watched, intercepted, tried by due process, imprisoned, and eventually released back into society. Gordievsky risked his life for a cause; Ames wanted a bigger car. Ames chose to serve a brutal totalitarian regime for which he felt no affinity, a country where he would never have considered living; Gordievsky had tasted democratic freedom, and made it his mission to defend and support that way of life and culture, finally settling in the West at huge personal cost. In the end, the difference between them is a matter of moral judgment: Gordievsky was on the side of the good; and Ames was on his own side.

He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

Oleg Gordievsky still lives a double life. To his suburban neighbors, the bowed, bearded old man living quietly behind the tall hedges is just another old-age pensioner, a person of little consequence. In reality he is someone else entirely, a figure of profound historical importance and a remarkable man: proud, shrewd, irascible, his brooding manner illuminated by sudden flashes of ironic humor. He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

It contained the following: a Mars bar, a plastic Harrods bag, a map of western Russia, pills “for the relief of worry, irritability, insomnia and stress,” mosquito repellent, two bottles of chilled beer, and two cassette tapes: Dr. Hook’s Greatest Hits and Sibelius’s Finlandia.

They deserve far greater credit than I can give them; but, to their credit, they do not want it.

A sum of money is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a tale about bees.

All officers were officers for life, unless proved legally insane.

No member of the Rosewater Foundation could tell the Corporation what to do with the capital. Conversely, the Corporation was powerless to tell the Foundation what to do with the copious profits the Corporation made.

Leonard Leech, once told him about getting ahead in law. Leech said that, just as a good airplane pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer be looking for situations where large amounts of money were about to change hands.

"In every big transaction," said Leech, "there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient's blubbering thanks.".

Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day.

The report contained Eliot's speech to the writers word-for-word. The meeting, including Eliot's drunken interruption, had been taken down on tape. "I love you sons of bitches," Eliot said in Milford. "You're all I read any more.

You're the only ones with guts enough to _really_ care about the future, who _really_ notice what machines do to us, what wars do to us, what cities do to us, what big, simple ideas do to us, what tremendous misunderstandings, mistakes, accidents and catastrophes do to us. You're the only ones zany enough to agonize over time and distances without limit, over mysteries that will never die, over the fact that we are right now determining whether the space voyage for the next billion years or so is going to be Heaven or Hell." * Eliot admitted later on that science-fiction writers couldn't write for sour apples, but he declared that it didn't matter. He said they were poets just the same, since they were more sensitive to important changes than anybody who was writing well. "The hell with the talented sparrowfarts who write delicately of one small piece of one mere lifetime, when the issues are galaxies, eons, and trillions of souls yet to be born.".

He didn't understand that what Trout had in common with pornography wasn't sex but fantasies of an impossibly hospitable world.

In Milford, Eliot told the writers that he wished they would learn more about sex and economics and style, but then he supposed that people dealing with really big issues didn't have much time for such things.

To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

Am I in favor of feeding labor crooks to lions? Well, to give those who get such satisfaction from imagining that I am covered with primordial scales a little twinge of pleasure, let me say, "Yes. Absolutely. This afternoon, if it can be arranged." To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer. I still find it hard to realize that I am an alcoholic, though even strangers know this right away.

"You know, I think the main purpose of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps is to get poor Americans into clean, pressed, unpatched clothes, so rich Americans can stand to look at them.".

I've gone sixteen hours without a drink! I don't miss the poison at all! Cheers!.

He often carries birth-control devices in his pocket, which many people find alarming and disgusting. The same people find it alarming and disgusting that the boy's father did _not_ use birth-control devices.

"I'm going to love these discarded Americans, even though they're useless and unattractive. _That_ is going to be my work of art.".

"_hysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself_.".

Samaritrophia, _he read_, is the suppression of an overactive conscience by the rest of the mind.

"and she confessed to me that she spent the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of her life saying nothing but, 'No, thank you.' Which is all very well for a girl of that age and station. But it would have been a damned unattractive trait in a _male_ Rockefeller, and an even more unsuitable one, if I may say so, in a male Rosewater.".

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more." Eliot.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more.".

It was stashed into a foundation in order that tax-collectors and other predators not named Rosewater might be prevented from getting their hands on it.

What engaged his emotions was the fact that the Rosewater fortune was the largest single money package represented by McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. He recalled what his favorite professor,.

Mushari, who thought of himself as brave little David about to slay Goliath, was exactly half his age. And it was almost as though God Himself wanted little David to win, for confidential document after document proved that Eliot was crazy as a loon.

And Samuel bought newspapers, and preachers, too. He gave them this simple lesson to teach, and they taught it well: _Anybody who thought that the United States of America was supposed to be a Utopia was a piggy, lazy, God-damned fool_. Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day. And yet he could be thankful for the opportunity to pay a hundred thousand dollars or more for a painting by an Italian three centuries dead. And he capped this insult by giving paintings to museums for the spiritual elevation of the poor. The museums were closed on Sundays.

Giving ninety-five per cent of it to the Foundation you now control didn't cause him a twinge.

The family visited the so-called "home" in Rosewater County very briefly every year, just long enough to reinvigorate the lie that it was home.

His duties, according to the charter, were exactly as flimsy or as formidable as he himself declared them to be.

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers --joined in the serious business of keeping our food, shelter, clothing and loved ones from combining with oxygen.

He drove away his rich friends by telling them that whatever they had was based on dumb luck. He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do. He asked his scholarly friends, "Who has time to read all the boring crap you write and listen to all the boring things you say?" He alienated his friends in the sciences by thanking them extravagantly for scientific advances he had read about in recent newspapers and magazines, by assuring them, with a perfectly straight face, that life was getting better and better, thanks to scientific thinking.

Hamlet had one big edge on me. His father's ghost told him exactly what he had to do, while I am operating without instructions. But from somewhere something is trying to tell me where to go, what to do there, and why to do it. Don't worry, I don't hear voices. But there is this feeling that I have a destiny far away from the shallow and preposterous posing that is our life in New York. And I roam.

It was the one dash of reality added by Eliot's great-grandfather to a stock and bond fantasy of a canal that would join Chicago, Indianapolis, Rosewater and the Ohio.

Avondale as a constitutional monarch. They were employees of the Rosewater Corporation, and the properties they managed were owned by the Rosewater Foundation. Eliot could not tell them what to do --but he was surely the King, and Avondale knew it.

The therapist, after a deeply upsetting investigation of normality at this time and place, was bound to conclude that a normal person, functioning well on the upper levels of a prosperous, industrialized society, can hardly hear his conscience at all.

"Yes. If I don't make anything else clear tonight, at least let me make that clear: Eliot is right to do what he's doing. It's beautiful what he's doing. I'm simply not strong enough or good enough to be by his side any more. The fault is mine.".

"The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

Pained mystification, and then helplessness, suffused the Senator's face. "Tell me one good thing about those people Eliot helps." "I can't." "I thought not." "It's a secret thing," she said, forced to argue, pleading for the argument to stop right there. Without any notion of how merciless he was being, the Senator pressed on. "You're among friends now --suppose you tell us what this great secret is." "The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

"Sixty-eight years is a long time for a body to live without having one nice thing ever happen to the body. Nothing nice ever happened to me. How could it? I was behind the door when the good Lord passed out the brains.".

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If.

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If Eliot is going to love everybody, no matter what they are, no matter what they do, then those of us who love particular people for particular reasons had better find ourselves a new word.".

He looked up at an oil painting of his deceased wife. "For instance --I loved _her_ more than I loved our garbage collector, which makes me guilty of the most unspeakable of modern crimes: _Dis-crim-i-nay-tion_.".

"We don't piss in your ashtrays, So please don't throw cigarettes in our urinals.".

Stick your stainless steel spoon in this unhappy old man's brains, Doctor,' I told him, 'and stir.'.

Says, '_Don't Kill Yourself. Call the Rosewater Foundation_,' and it's got your number." Such stickers were in every phone booth in the county, and in the back windows of the cars and trucks of most of the volunteer firemen, too. "You know what somebody's written right under that in pencil?" "No.".

"The Government. If I'm not a Church, and I still want to keep people from killing themselves, I must be the Government. Right?".

"I'd ask you to name the rock-bottom price you'd charge to go on living for just one more week.".

Why do so many souls voluntarily return to Earth after failing and dying, failing and dying, failing and dying there? Because Heaven is such a null.

And those who read these lines of wit Should eat these little balls of shit.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes. I think it's terrible the way people don't share things in this country. I think it's a heartless government that will let one baby be born owning a big piece of the country, the way I was born, and let another baby be born without owning anything.

"We come to a supremely ironic moment in history, for Senator Rosewater of Indiana now asks his own son, 'Are you or have you ever been a communist?'" "Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

There's plenty for everybody in this country, if we'll only _share_.

"Sure --provided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there is a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and the powerful are,' I'd.

'Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies --: "'God damn it, you've got to be kind.'".

He came out of the Pisquontuit Drug Store, squinted in the sunlight, took three deep breaths, went into the Pisquontuit News Store next door.

The lawyers and bankers felt somewhat cheated, since George didn't seem to be drawing any sort of moral from what should have been an important experience in almost any man's life. One lawyer, who had been looking forward to pointing out the moral when George got mad, couldn't restrain himself from pointing it out anyway, even though George was laughing: "People should always _read_ things before they sign them.".

It was on top of a jelly cupboard in the cellar of Fred's home. That was where he kept the rat poison, too.

The carpenter was worth twenty thousand dollars dead, thanks to Fred. He could think of little else but suicide whenever premium time rolled around.

"It comes when I have a bride come up to me and say, 'I don't know how the children and I can ever thank you enough for what you've done. God bless you, Mr. Rosewater.'".

"And your father didn't name us your guardians in his will because he thought we would agree politely with anything you might say.

"Every year at least one young man whose affairs we manage comes into our office, wants to give his money away. He has completed his first year at some great university. It has been an eventful year! He has learned of unbelievable suffering around the world. He has learned of the great crimes that are at the roots of so many family fortunes. He has had his Christian nose rubbed, often for the very first time, in the Sermon on the Mount. "He is confused, tearful, angry! He demands to know, in hollow tones, how much money he is worth. We tell him. He goes haggard with shame, even if his fortune is based on something as honest and useful as Scotch Tape, aspirin, rugged pants for the working man, or, as in your case, brooms. You have, if I'm not mistaken, just completed one year at Harvard?" "Yes." "It's a great institution, but, when I see the effect it has on certain young people, I ask myself, 'How dare a university teach compassion without teaching history, too?' History tells us this, my dear young Mr. Buntline, if it tells us nothing else: Giving away a fortune is a futile and destructive thing. It makes winners of the poor, without making them rich or even comfortable. And the donor and his descendents become undistinguished members of the whining poor.".

Your fortune is the most important single determinant of what you think of yourself and of what others think of you. Because of the money, you are extraordinary. Without it, for example, you would not now be taking the priceless time of a senior partner in McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee.

That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

Let me see you smile! Let me see that you already understand what they do not teach at Harvard until the junior year: That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

"That's what I was _going_ to guess," said Caroline.

"People get what they deserve," said Amanita. "Isn't that right, Bunny?" "That's the First Law of Life," said Bunny Weeks.

There was never much doing in life insurance for poor people on warm afternoons.

The oath, which Selena had taken six hundred times, before six hundred very plain suppers, went like this, and was written by Castor Buntline, poor old Stewart's great-grandfather: I do solemnly swear that I will respect the sacred private property of others, and that I will be content with whatever station in life God Almighty may assign me to. I will be grateful to those who employ me, and will never complain about wages and hours, but will ask myself instead, "What more can I do for my employer, my republic, and my God?" I understand that I have not been placed on Earth to be happy. I am here to be tested. If I am to pass the test, I must be always unselfish, always sober, always truthful, always chaste in mind, body, and deed, and always respectful to those to whom God has, in His Wisdom, placed above me.

All right, we're poor! This is America! And America is one place in this sorry world where people shouldn't _have_ to apologize for being poor. The question in America should be, 'Is this guy a good citizen? Is he honest? Does he pull his own weight?'".

I've got the clap, and the blueballs, too. The clap don't hurt, but the blueballs do.

"I'm leaving," said Peach. "I know when I'm not wanted.".

"Kilgore Trout once wrote a whole book about a country that was devoted to fighting odors. That was the national purpose. There wasn't any disease, and there wasn't any crime, and there wasn't any war, so they went after odors.".

The Senator blew up. "Why do you _hate_ me so?" he cried. Eliot was flabbergasted. "Hate you? Father --I don't hate you. I don't hate anybody." "Your every act and word is aimed at hurting me as much as you possibly can!".

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use?.

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use? "In time, almost all men and women will become worthless as producers of goods, food, services, and more machines, as sources of practical ideas in the areas of economics, engineering, and probably medicine, too. So --if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are _human beings_, then we might as well, as has so often been suggested, rub them out.".

"There we have people treasuring people as people. It's extremely rare. So from this we must learn.".

"I just wish you'd stop saying you're a socialist. You're not! You're a free-enterpriser!".

"Keep away from booze, remember who you are, and behave accordingly," the Senator roundly declared. "And don't play God to people, or they will slobber all over you, take you for everything they can get, break commandments just for the fun of being forgiven --and revile you when you are gone.".

"It seems to me," said Trout, "that the main lesson Eliot learned is that people can use all the uncritical love they can get.".

"It's news that a man was able to _give_ that kind of love over a long period of time. If one man can do it, perhaps others can do it, too. It means that our hatred of useless human beings and the cruelties we inflict upon them for their own good need not be parts of human nature. Thanks to the example of Eliot Rosewater, millions upon millions of people may learn to love and help whomever they see.".

"Let their names be Rosewater from this moment on. And tell them that their father loves them, no matter what they may turn out to be. And tell them --" Eliot fell silent, raised his tennis racket as though it were a magic wand. "And tell them," he began again, "to be fruitful and multiply.".

Imagine what it would be like to see yourself dead and to discover that nobody missed you or even cared that you’d died. That’s what happens to Scrooge when he meets the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

And at the very least, the next time you hear someone described as ‘dead as a doornail’ you’ll know that it was Charles Dickens who made the phrase popular and you’ll think, as I do, of Old Marley, coming spookily to life on Scrooge’s front door.

# Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy)

There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself.


# India: A History. Revised and Updated (Keay, John)

‘Prior to the thirteenth century AD,’ wrote Professor R.C. Majumdar in the 1950s, ‘we possess no historical text of any kind, much less such a detailed narrative as we possess in the case of Greece, Rome or China.’.


# Norse Mythology (Neil Gaiman)

The gods were going to battle the frost giants, and they were all going to die.

The Norse myths are the myths of a chilly place, with long, long winter nights and endless summer days, myths of a people who did not entirely trust or even like their gods, although they respected and feared them.

You can find Tyr the one-handed (Odin’s son), Odin, Thor, and Frigg, the queen of the gods, in, respectively, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Freya’s tears, for example, was a poetic way of saying “gold.”.

As I retold these myths, I tried to imagine myself a long time ago, in the lands where these stories were first told, during the long winter nights perhaps, under the glow of the northern lights, or sitting outside in the small hours, awake in the unending daylight of midsummer, with an audience of people who wanted to know what else Thor did, and what the rainbow was, and how to live their lives, and where bad poetry comes from.

# Everybody Loves a Good Drought (P. Sainath)

Oddly, the same Government of India waved a different wand at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. And that was less than nine months before it found a fall in poverty in the country. At that summit, it presented a document saying 39.9 per cent of Indians were below the poverty line. It was, after all, begging for money from donors. The more the poor, the more the money. At home, less than 300 days later, it produced the 19 per cent estimate. (Those intrigued by the mysteries of the official poverty line can look at Appendix 1 at the back of the book.).

But I did want to escape what Swami Vivekananda once described as the propensity of the Indian elite to discuss for hours whether a glass of water ought to be taken with the left hand or the right hand. So the focus remains on people and their problems.

These were Ramnad and Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, Godda and Palamau in Bihar, Malkangiri and Nuapada in Orissa and Surguja and Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh.

These projects are just started for the money they bring, not for the Korwas or anyone else.’.

‘If the money were simply put into bank fixed deposits, none of these families would ever have to work again. The interest alone would make them very well off by Surguja’s standards.’.

In 1992, USAID gave India US $ 325 million (Rs. 800 crores) to be spent solely on population control in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This programme has serious implications. One is that hazardous contraceptives like Norplant will be pushed onto very poof rural women who have little or no access to proper health care. The same contraceptives are not in general use in any Western country.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health. The current figure of public spending is 1.3 per cent of GDP. Nicaragua spends 6.7, Brazil 2.8 and China 2.1 per cent. Among the advanced industrial nations, Sweden spends 7.9 and the United States 5.6 per cent.

Only 20 per cent of hospital beds are in rural areas where 80 per cent of Indians live.

More than a few doctors, having been trained at the expense of the poorest people in the world, settle abroad to address the ailments of affluent Americans. So some of the most deprived, disease-ridden people subsidise the health of the richest.

Lack of resources has little to do with it. Maharashtra and Gujarat are the two states praised for having been at the front line of the economic ‘reforms’. Between August 1991 and August 1994, the two attracted investments worth Rs. 114,000 crores (almost $ 38 billion). Yet, these were the states where the plague broke out. Even before the reforms began, Gujarat was spending only around Rs. 49 per capita on health. (The reform period brought more cuts.) The figure for Kerala, a much poorer state than Gujarat in economic terms, was Rs. 71.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69. The average Keralite can expect to live 72 years. For Gujaratis that figure is 61 years and for Maharashtrians 63.

Kerala’s IMR and life expectancy rates are comparable with those of the USA.

Biswas’s brother is also a ‘doctor’. Taking a diploma in homoeopathy at an institute the name of which he has regrettably forgotten, he now practises allopathy in the same village as his sibling.

Words like ‘chloroquine’ and ‘paracetamol’ are not easy to handle even for English speakers. For a tipsy dissari, mixing mantras with mahua, they can be tricky and harmful if interchanged.

And one of the first things to happen was this: the people in the PHCs there got hauled up for talking to me and ‘leaking’ stuff from the records.

The actual gap between SC/ ST literacy levels and those of the non-SC/ ST population grew worse between 1961 and 1981.

S.C. Jain saab is the principal of the Government Postgraduate College in Alirajpur. He is also in charge of all UGC programmes in the college. Besides, he is the head of the Botany department, the Physics department and the Law department. In past years, he has headed, at least temporarily, several other departments. He rounds off this portfolio by being the college sports officer. In his spare time—if a person of such onerous responsibilities can have any spare time —he practises ayurveda and homoeopathy. Clearly a man of many parts.

Less than fifteen people found jobs, at very menial levels, in HAL, which has a total workforce of around 4,500. Another thirty also got into HAL, with some difficulty, as casual labourers. They had no security of tenure. Those who ‘made it’ as casual workers were offered an alternative home—120 km away from the HAL township.

Then, too, Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Orissa. ‘And he had this grand idea that all the units of HAL would come to Koraput.’ So huge tracts of land were acquired in pursuit of that vision.

The other units of HAL came up in Bangalore and elsewhere. As a result, thousands of acres forcibly taken over from the eighteen villages remain unused to this day.

He was clearly hoping I would ask. ‘The third crop in this region is drought relief. The funds involved in it are huge but the harvest is generally reaped by block-level officials and their contractor friends.

Simply put, the Oriya migrants have to suffer because they came to Andhra Pradesh on their own. That they are very much in the grip of contractors here does not count. And secondly, the Andhra labour department cannot be held legally responsible for their plight.

# Learn to Earn (Peter Lynch)

A lot of people must have told you by now that it’s important to get a good education, so you can find a promising career that pays you a decent wage. But they may not have told you that in the long run, it’s not just how much money you make that will determine your future prosperity. It’s how much of that money you put to work by saving it and investing it.

# The Course of Love: A Novel (Alain de Botton)

A marriage doesn’t begin with a proposal, or even an initial meeting. It begins far earlier, when the idea of love is born, and more specifically the dream of a soul mate.

It may come very fast, this certainty that another human being is a soul mate. We needn’t have spoken with them; we may not even know their name. Objective knowledge doesn’t come into it. What matters instead is intuition, a spontaneous feeling that seems all the more accurate and worthy of respect because it bypasses the normal processes of reason.

He will surmise that love can endure only when one is unfaithful to its beguiling opening ambitions, and that, for his relationships to work, he will need to give up on the feelings that got him into them in the first place. He will need to learn that love is a skill rather than an enthusiasm.

What we typically call love is only the start of love.

In the midst of this practical conversation, he manages nonetheless to catch the occasional glimpse of a more private side. To his question about her parents, Kirsten answers, with a note of awkwardness in her voice, that she was brought up in Inverness by her mother alone, her father having lost interest in family life early on. “It wasn’t an ideal start to make me hopeful about people,” she says with a wry smile (and he realizes it’s the left upper front tooth that is at a bit of an angle). “Maybe that’s why the thought of ‘happily ever after’ has never really been my thing.”.

Instead of which, Rabih feels certain that he has discovered someone endowed with the most extraordinary combination of inner and outer qualities: intelligence and kindness, humor and beauty, sincerity and courage; someone whom he would miss if she left the room even though she had been entirely unknown to him but two hours before; someone whose fingers—currently drawing faint lines with a toothpick across the tablecloth—he longs to caress and squeeze between his own; someone with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life.

We tend not to get very anxious when seducing people we don’t much care about.

At the perimeter of Kirsten’s life, he is at the apogee of modesty.

Love stories begin not when we fear someone may be unwilling to see us again but when they decide they would have no objection to seeing us all the time; not when they have every opportunity to run away but when they have exchanged solemn vows promising to hold us, and be held captive by us, for life.

Love stories begin not when we fear someone may be unwilling to see us again but when they decide they would have no objection to seeing us all the time; not when they have every opportunity to run away but when they have exchanged solemn vows promising to hold us, and be held captive by us, for life. Our understanding of love has been hijacked and beguiled by its first distractingly moving moments. We have allowed our love stories to end way too early. We seem to know far too much about how love starts, and recklessly little about how it might continue.

He has, without knowing how, richly succeeded at the three central challenges underpinning the Romantic idea of love: he has found the right person; he has opened his heart to her; and he has been accepted.

He loves from a feeling of incompleteness—and from a desire to be made whole.

Family folklore has it that Kirsten’s father upped and left one morning, having packed a small suitcase while his wife of ten years was off teaching. The sole explanation he provided was a slip of paper on the hallway table with “Sorry” scrawled on it. Thereafter he drifted around Scotland, taking up odd jobs on farms, keeping in touch with Kirsten only through an annual card and a gift on her birthday.

The sole explanation he provided was a slip of paper on the hallway table with “Sorry” scrawled on it. Thereafter he drifted around Scotland, taking up odd jobs on farms, keeping in touch with Kirsten only through an annual card and a gift on her birthday. When she turned twelve, a package arrived containing a cardigan fit for a nine-year-old. Kirsten sent it back to an address in Cammachmore, along with a note advising the sender of her frank hope that he would die soon. There has been no word from him since. Had he left for another woman, he would merely have betrayed his wedding vows. But to leave his wife and child simply to be by himself, to have more of his own company, without ever furnishing a satisfactory account of his motives—this was rejection on an altogether deeper, more abstract, and more devastating scale.

Love reaches a pitch at those moments when our beloved turns out to understand, more clearly than others have ever been able to, and perhaps even better than we do ourselves, the chaotic, embarrassing, and shameful parts of us. That someone else gets who we are and both sympathizes with us and forgives us for what they see underpins our whole capacity to trust and to give. Love is a dividend of gratitude for our lover’s insight into our own confused and troubled psyche.

Without shaming him, she can identify and name the forms his madness sometimes takes.

They normally have to answer to names imposed on them by the rest of the world, used on official documents and by government bureaucracies, but love inspires them to cast around for nicknames that will more precisely accord with the respective sources of their tenderness.

Her being submissive to him means allowing a loving person to tell her exactly what to do, letting him take responsibility and choice away from her.

To receive the apparently dirtiest, most private, guiltiest part of her lover into the most public, most respectable part of herself is symbolically to free them both from the punishing dichotomy between dirty and clean, bad and good—in the process, as they fly through the glacial lower atmosphere towards Scheveningen at 400 kilometers an hour, returning unity to their previously divided and shamed selves.

It tells us something about the relative status of rigorous analysis in the nuptial process that it would be considered un-Romantic, and even mean, to ask an engaged couple to explain in any depth, with patience and self-awareness, what exactly had led them to make and accept a proposal. But we’re keen, of course, always to ask where and how the proposal took place.

The prestige of instinct is the legacy of a collective traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable “reason.”.

Life on his own had become, he realized then, untenable. He had had enough of solitary walks home at the end of desultory parties; of entire Sundays passed without speaking a word to another human; of holidays spent tagging along with harassed couples whose children left them no energy for conversation; of the knowledge that he occupied no important place in anyone’s heart.

A shameful extent, the charm of marriage boils down to how unpleasant it is to be alone. This isn’t necessarily our fault as individuals. Society as a whole appears determined to render the single state as nettlesome and.

To a shameful extent, the charm of marriage boils down to how unpleasant it is to be alone. This isn’t necessarily our fault as individuals. Society as a whole appears determined to render the single state as nettlesome and depressing as possible: once the freewheeling days of school and university are over, company and warmth become dispiritingly hard to find; social life starts to revolve oppressively around couples; there’s no one left to call or hang out with. It’s hardly surprising, then, if when we find someone halfway decent, we might cling.

The success of any relationship should be determined, not just by how happy a couple are to be together, but by how worried each partner would be about not being in a relationship at all.

Marriage: a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don’t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully omitted to investigate.

He would find it so much easier to give blood to an injured child in Badakhshan or to carry water to a family in Kandahar than to lean across and say sorry to his wife.

The small issues are really just large ones that haven’t been accorded the requisite attention.

“When you say you want a window open in the middle of winter, it scares and upsets me—emotionally rather than physically. It seems to me to speak of a future in which precious things will be trampled upon. It reminds me of a certain sadistic stoicism and cheerful bravery in you which I am generally in flight from. On some subconscious level, I feel afraid that it’s not really fresh air you want but that, instead, you’d ideally like to push me out of the window in your charming but brusque, sensible, daunting way.”.

“My insistence on leaving so early is in the end a symptom of fear. In a world of randomness and surprises, it’s a technique I’ve developed to ward off anxiety and an unholy, unnameable sense of dread. I want to be on time the same way others lust for power and from a similar drive for security; it makes a little sense, though only a little, in light of the fact that I spent my childhood waiting for a father who never showed up. It’s my own crazy way of trying to stay sane.”.

Over a single weekend they might spin from claustrophobia to admiration, desire to boredom, indifference to ecstasy, irritation to tenderness.

“Oh, come on!” she says, raising her voice to be heard. “At least tell me what’s going on.” To which he replies, “Fuck you, leave me alone.” Which is sometimes how fear can sound.

At the heart of a sulk lies a confusing mixture of intense anger and an equally intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about.

It is a privilege to be the recipient of a sulk; it means the other person respects and trusts us enough to think we should understand their unspoken hurt. It is one of the odder gifts of love.

Only when we don’t have to explain can we feel certain that we are genuinely understood.

Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, dangerous ideal that can be traced back to our earliest childhoods: the promise of wordless understanding. In the womb, we never had to explain. Our every requirement was catered to. The right sort of comfort simply happened. Some of this idyll continued in our first years. We didn’t have to make our every requirement known: large, kind people guessed for us. They saw past our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions: they found the explanations for discomforts which we lacked the ability to verbalize. That may be why, in relationships, even the most eloquent among us may instinctively prefer not to spell things out when our partners are at risk of failing to read us properly. Only wordless and accurate mind reading can feel like a true sign that our partner is someone to be trusted; only when we don’t have to explain can we feel certain that we are genuinely understood. When.

We do our sulking lovers the greatest possible favor when we are able to regard their tantrums as we would those of an infant. We are so alive to the idea that it’s patronizing to be thought of as younger than we are; we forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with—and forgive—the disappointed, furious, inarticulate child within.

Speaking up and volunteering one’s opinions were not standard practices among the Khans.

Rabih thereby grew up to understand the love of others as a reward for being good, not for being transparent.

Rabih thereby grew up to understand the love of others as a reward for being good, not for being transparent. As an adult and as a husband, he lacks any idea of how to make something coherent out of the nonnormative parts of himself. It is neither arrogance nor a sense that his wife has no right to know who he really is that makes him secretive and hesitant; rather, it is sheer terror that his tendencies towards self-loathing will be intensified to an unbearable degree by the presence of a witness.

Complete indifference. He has chosen love over libido.

Unfortunately, to admit that we may be drawing on the confusions of the past to force an interpretation onto what’s happening now seems humbling and not a little humiliating: Surely we know the difference between our partner and a disappointing parent, between a husband’s short delay and a father’s permanent abandonment; between some dirty laundry and a civil war?.

“Sorry to have interrupted you, Mrs. Khan. But I think I used to live here,” says Rabih. “Definitely not. You must be looking for 34A, and this is 34B, you see. . . .” “I think we once got married. Do you remember? That’s our child, Dobbie, over there in the corner. He’s very silent. Kind of like his mum.”.

Neither he nor she have to be perfect, he reflects; they only need to give each other the odd sign they know they can sometimes be quite hard to live with.

We don’t need to be constantly reasonable in order to have good relationships; all we need to have mastered is the occasional capacity to acknowledge with good grace that we may, in one or two areas, be somewhat insane.

The most superficially irrational, immature, lamentable, but nonetheless common of all the presumptions of love is that the person to whom we have pledged ourselves is not just the center of our emotional existence but is also, as a result—and yet in a very strange, objectively insane and profoundly unjust way—responsible for everything that happens to us, for good or ill. Therein lies the peculiar and sick privilege of love.

The world upsets, disappoints, frustrates, and hurts us in countless ways at every turn. It delays us, rejects our creative endeavors, overlooks us for promotions, rewards idiots, and smashes our ambitions on its bleak, relentless shoals. And almost invariably we can’t complain about any of it. It’s too difficult to tease out who may really be to blame—and too dangerous to complain even when we know for certain (lest we be fired or laughed at). There is only one person to whom we can expose our catalogue of grievances, one person who can be the recipient of all our accumulated rage at the injustices and imperfections of our lives. It is of course the height of absurdity to blame them. But this is to misunderstand the rules under which love operates. It is because we cannot scream at the forces who are really responsible that we get angry with those we are sure will best tolerate us for blaming them. We take it out on the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in the vicinity, the ones least likely to have harmed us, but the ones most likely to stick around while we pitilessly rant at them.

The accusations we make of our lovers make no particular sense. We would utter such unfair things to no one else on earth. But our wild charges are a peculiar proof of intimacy and trust, a symptom of love itself—and in their own way a perverted manifestation of commitment. Whereas we can say something sensible and polite to any stranger, it is only in the presence of the lover we wholeheartedly believe in that can we dare to be extravagantly and boundlessly unreasonable.

People who are planning to sack you should really have the decency and courage not also to want you to like them, reflects Rabih.

The very concept of trying to “teach” a lover things feels patronizing, incongruous, and plain sinister.

The very concept of trying to “teach” a lover things feels patronizing, incongruous, and plain sinister. If we truly loved someone, there could be no talk of wanting him or her to change.

It is this fundamental commitment to benevolence that makes the early months of love so moving.

And yet the best guarantee of calm in a teacher is a relative indifference to the success or failure of his or her lesson.

Maturity means acknowledging that Romantic love might only constitute a narrow and perhaps rather mean-minded aspect of emotional life, one principally focused on a quest to find love rather than to give it, to be loved rather than to love. Children may end up being the unexpected teachers of people many times their age, to whom they offer—through their exhaustive dependence, egoism, and vulnerability—an advanced education in a wholly new sort of love, one in which reciprocation is never jealously demanded or fractiously regretted and in which the true goal is nothing less than the transcendence of oneself for the sake of another.

As parents, we learn another thing about love: how much power we have over people who depend on us and, therefore, what responsibilities we have to tread carefully around those who have been placed at our mercy.

We learn of an unexpected capacity to hurt without meaning to: to frighten through eccentricity or unpredictability, anxiety or momentary irritation.

He finds it almost heartbreaking to remember that there is a place not far away from his office where people know how to care properly about one another and where a person’s tears and confusion, let alone lunch menu and sleeping position, can be of such deep concern to another human.

Anything can be a good starting point for curiosity when you haven’t yet got to the stifling stage of supposedly knowing where your interests lie.

It is a wonderful thing to live in a world where so many people are nice to children. It would be even better if we lived in one where we were a little nicer to the childlike sides of one another.

A person has to feel rather safe around someone else in order to be this difficult. Before a child can throw a tantrum, the background atmosphere needs to be profoundly benevolent.

The role of being a good parent brings with it one large and very tricky requirement: to be the constant bearer of deeply unfortunate news. The good parent must be the defender of a range of the child’s long-term interests, which are by nature entirely impossible for him or her to envisage, let alone assent to cheerfully. Out of love, parents must gird themselves to speak of clean teeth, homework, tidy rooms, bedtimes, generosity, and limits to computer usage. Out of love, they must adopt the guise of bores with a hateful and maddening habit of bringing up unwelcome facts about existence just when the fun is really starting. And, as a result of these subterranean loving acts, good parents must, if things have gone well, end up as the special targets of intense resentment and indignation.

“people whose suggestions I may go along with if—and only if—I see the point of what they’re saying.”.

It’s a strange thing indeed for Rabih, congenitally intent as he is on avoiding confrontation of any sort, to have to deliver such an apparently unloving message to someone he loves beyond measure.

Once, when Esther was four, she said to both her parents, with great seriousness, “I wish Mummy would die so I could marry Daddy.”.

She can see what a bewitching and glamorous figure Rabih could seem to someone under ten.

Parental kindness were enough, the human race would stagnate and in time die off. The survival of the species hinges on children eventually getting fed up and heading off into the world armed with hopes of finding more satisfying sources of excitement.

If parental kindness were enough, the human race would stagnate and in time die off. The survival of the species hinges on children eventually getting fed up and heading off into the world armed with hopes of finding more satisfying sources of excitement.

As Esther talks, William can be heard singing in the background, making a show of how uninterested he is in any father who has had the bad taste to leave him behind.

He is in love with a woman who too often appears not to need love at all; a fighter so capable and strong that there are few opportunities afforded to nurture her; someone with a problematic relationship to anyone inclined to help her, and who sometimes seems most comfortable when she feels disappointed by those to whom she has entrusted herself.

One generally has to care quite a lot about a partner to bother to betray them.

It makes him feel a little lonely to realize how easy it is to be liked by someone who has no idea who he is.

Otherwise it may seem that what we are dealing with is not really love at all but rather a kind of small-minded and hypocritical possessiveness, a desire to make one’s partner happy if, but only if, that happiness involves oneself.

Is there not, wonders Rabih, an infantile idealism in our wish to find everything in one other being—someone who will be simultaneously a best friend, a lover, a co-parent, a co-chauffeur, and a business partner? What a recipe for disappointment and resentment in this notion upon which millions of otherwise perfectly good marriages regularly founder.

He’s impelled to say the very worst things, to try to smash the relationship to see if it’s real and worth trusting.

Love isn’t like a cake: if you give love to one person, it doesn’t mean there is less for anyone.

But in order for love to keep going, it also seems impossible to imagine partners not learning to keep a great many of their thoughts to themselves.

No relationship could start without a commitment to wholehearted intimacy. But in order for love to keep going, it also seems impossible to imagine partners not learning to keep a great many of their thoughts to themselves.

The person who can’t tolerate secrets, who in the name of “being honest” shares information so wounding to the other that it can never be forgotten—this person is no friend of love. And if we suspect (as we should regularly if our relationship is a worthy one) that our partner is also lying (about what she’s thinking of, how he judges our work, where she was last night, etc.), then we would do well not to act the sharp and relentless inquisitor. It may be kinder, wiser, and closer to the true spirit of love to pretend we simply didn’t notice.

The truth risks distorting the relationship far more than the untruth.

For most of recorded history, people stayed married because they were keen to fit in with the expectations of society, had a few assets to protect, and wanted to maintain the unity of their families. Then gradually another, very different standard took hold: couples were to remain together, ran the thought, only so long as certain feelings still obtained between them—feelings of authentic enthusiasm, desire, and fulfillment. In this new Romantic order, spouses could be justified in parting ways if the marital routine had become deadening, if the children were getting on their nerves, if sex was no longer enticing, or if either party had lately been feeling a little unhappy.

The more Rabih appreciates how chaotic and directionless his feelings are, the more sympathetic he grows to the idea of marriage as an institution.

At a conference, he might spy an attractive woman and want to throw away everything for her sake, only to recognize two days later that he would prefer to be dead than without Kirsten. Or, during protracted rainy weekends, he might wish that his children might grow up and leave him alone until the end of time so he could read his magazine in peace—and then a day later, at the office, his heart would tighten with grief because a meeting threatened to overrun and get him home an hour too late to put the kids to bed.

The avoidant person for their part will speak of a need for “space,” will enjoy their own company, and will find requirements for sexual intimacy daunting at points.

Rabih anxiously attacks; Kirsten avoidantly withdraws.

They cannot offer each other that most romantically necessary of gifts: a guide to their own vulnerabilities.

1. “I want emotionally close relationships, but I find that other people are often disappointing or mean without good reason. I worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others. I don’t mind spending time on my own.” (avoidant attachment).

2. “I want to be emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that they are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I worry that others don’t value me as much as I value them. It can make me feel very upset and annoyed.” (anxious attachment).

3. “It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I feel comfortable depending on others and having them depend on me. I don’t worry about being alone or not being accepted by others.” (secure attachment).

He is on track to die with the largest parts of his talent still unexploited, registering as mere flashes of inspiration that he occasionally perceives out of the corner of his mind’s eye while he’s in the shower or driving alone down the motorway.

This isn’t a midlife crisis; it’s more that he is finally, some thirty years too late, leaving adolescence behind.

He sees he is a man with an exaggerated longing for Romantic love who nevertheless understands little about kindness and even less about communication.

Rabih used to assume that only the flawless version of anything was worth having. He was a perfectionist. If the car was scratched, he couldn’t enjoy driving it; if the room was untidy, he couldn’t rest; if his lover didn’t understand parts of him, the entire relationship was a charade. Now “good enough” is becoming good enough.

He’s learnt, over many painful episodes, that his beautiful, intelligent wife doesn’t do reassurance.

But, better than that, he’s started to understand why. She isn’t mean; it’s her experience of men and her defenses against being let down kicking in. It’s just how she processes challenges. It helps to see these things; he is accruing alternatives to vengeance and anger.

Few in this world are ever simply nasty; those who hurt us are themselves in pain. The appropriate response is hence never cynicism nor aggression but, at the rare moments one can manage it, always love.

How could a parent ever truly approve? How could they possibly be expected, after eighteen or so years of answering to a child’s every need, to react enthusiastically to a new and competing source of love? How could anyone sincerely perform the requisite emotional somersault and not suspect in their heart—and let on as much, through a succession of more or less sour remarks—that their child had mistakenly fallen into the clutches of someone fundamentally unsuited to the complex and unique task of administering to them?.

Today’s so-called bad photograph will be next year’s good one. Nature’s kind trick is to make everything happen so slowly that we don’t get as scared as we should.

He is a collection of tissues and cells delicately and intricately conjoined and brought to life for only an instant. It will take just one sharp collision or a fall to render them inanimate again. All the seriousness of his plans depends on a steady flow of blood to his brain through a vulnerable network of capillaries. Should any of these suffer even the tiniest of failures, the tenuous sense he has begun to make of life will at once be erased. He is just a fortuitous constellation of atoms which have chosen to resist entropy for a few moments within cosmic eternity. He wonders which of his organs will fail first.

One evening, returning home through the dark streets, he spots a florist’s shop. He must have passed it many, many times, and yet he’s never taken any notice of it before. The front window is brightly illuminated and filled with a variety of blooms. He steps in, and an elderly woman smiles warmly at him. His eye is drawn to the first native flowers of a tentative spring: snowdrops. He watches the woman’s hands wrap the little bunch in fine white tissue. “For someone nice, I think?” She smiles at him. “My wife,” he replies. “Lucky woman,” she says as she hands him the bundle and his change. He hopes to get home and, on this occasion, prove the florist right.

It’s not the paradox it seems. Given that marriage yields its important lessons only to those who have enrolled in its curriculum, it’s normal that readiness should tend to follow rather than precede the ceremony itself, perhaps by a decade or two.

Choosing a person to marry is hence just a matter of deciding exactly what kind of suffering we want to endure rather than of assuming we have found a way to skirt the rules of emotional existence.

For this realization to sink in, it helps to have had a few lovers before settling down, not in order to have had a chance to locate “the right person,” but in order to have had an ample opportunity to discover at first hand, and in many different contexts, the truth that there isn’t any such a person; that everyone really is a bit wrong when considered from close up.

It’s everyone else who is out of step . . . and yet, maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness.

It’s profoundly counterintuitive for us to think of ourselves as mad. We seem so normal and mostly so good—to ourselves. It’s everyone else who is out of step . . . and yet, maturity begins with the capacity to sense and, in good time and without defensiveness, admit to our own craziness.

Rabih is ready for marriage because he is prepared to love rather than be loved.

He is ready for marriage because (on a good day) he is happy to be taught and calm about teaching.

We are ready for marriage when we accept that, in a number of significant areas, our partner will be wiser, more reasonable, and more mature than we are.

“Sorry, Mr. Sfouf, that I haven’t always been who you wanted me to be.”.

And for a brief moment on the slopes of a Scottish mountain in the late-afternoon summer sun—and every now and then thereafter—Rabih Khan feels that he might, with Kirsten by his side, be strong enough for whatever life demands of him.


# Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, Third Edition: The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping - Now Revised and Updated (Robert M. Sapolsky)

But the outcome will also depend heavily on such surprising factors as his personality, the amount of emotional stress he experiences over the years, whether he has someone’s shoulder to cry on when those stressors occur.

As part of updating the material for this third edition, I have added two new chapters: one on the interactions between stress and sleep, and one on what stress has to do with addiction.

Yet most of us are not incapacitated by stress-related disease. Instead, we cope, both physiologically and psychologically, and some of us are spectacularly successful at it.

I love science, and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means that you cannot also choose compassion, or the arts, or be awed by nature. Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but to reinvent and reinvigorate it.

There is a tradition among stress physiologists who dedicate their books to their spouses or significant others, an unwritten rule that you are supposed to incorporate something cutesy about stress in the dedication. So, to Madge, who attenuates my stressors; for Arturo, the source of my eustress; for my wife who, over the course of the last umpteen years, has put up with my stress-induced hypertension, ulcerative colitis, loss of libido, and displaced aggression. I will forgo that style in the actual dedication of this book to my wife, as I have something simpler to say.

The diseases that plague us now are ones of slow accumulation of damage—heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disorders.

This book is a primer about stress, stress-related disease, and the mechanisms of coping with stress. How is it that our bodies can adapt to some stressful emergencies, while other ones make us sick? Why are some of us especially vulnerable to stress-related diseases, and what does that have to do with our personalities?.

How many hippos worry about whether Social Security is going to last as long as they will, or what they are going to say on a first date? Viewed from the perspective of the evolution of the animal kingdom, sustained psychological stress is a recent invention, mostly limited to humans and other social primates.

For animals like zebras, the most upsetting things in life are acute physical crises.

An organism can also be plagued by chronic physical challenges.

Drought, famine, parasites, that sort of unpleasantness—not the sort of experience we have often, but central events in the lives of non-westernized humans and most other mammals.

Critical to this book is a third category of ways to get upset—psychological and social disruptions.

Chess grand masters, during their tournaments, can place metabolic demands on their bodies that begin to approach those of athletes during the peak of a competitive event.

We can experience wildly strong emotions (provoking our bodies into an accompanying uproar) linked to mere thoughts.

And if someone spends months on end twisting his innards in anxiety, anger, and tension over some emotional problem, this might very well lead to illness.

Ah, that dimly remembered concept, the idea that the body has an ideal level of oxygen that it needs, an ideal degree of acidity, an ideal temperature, and so on. All these different variables are maintained in homeostatic balance, the state in which all sorts of physiological measures are being kept at the optimal level. The brain, it has been noted, has evolved to seek homeostasis.

But when we get into a physiological uproar and activate the stress-response for no reason at all, or over something we cannot do anything about, we call it things like “anxiety,” “neurosis,” “paranoia,” or “needless hostility.”.

Homeostasis is about tinkering with this valve or that gizmo. Allostasis is about the brain coordinating body-wide changes, often including changes in behavior.

One of the hallmarks of the stress-response is the rapid mobilization of energy from storage sites and the inhibition of further storage.

You have better things to do than digest breakfast when you are trying to avoid being someone’s lunch.

During stress, growth and tissue repair is curtailed, sexual drive decreases in both sexes; females are less likely to ovulate or to carry pregnancies to term, while males begin to have trouble with erections and secrete less testosterone.

If you constantly mobilize energy at the cost of energy storage, you will never store any surplus energy. You will fatigue more rapidly, and your risk of developing a form of diabetes will even increase.

But if you constantly try to balance a seesaw with two elephants instead of two little kids, all sorts of problems will emerge:.

The half of the autonomic nervous system that is turned on is called the sympathetic nervous system.

The sympathetic nervous system kicks into action during emergencies, or what you think are emergencies. It helps mediate vigilance, arousal, activation, mobilization. To generations of first-year medical students, it is described through the obligatory lame joke about the sympathetic nervous system mediating the four F’s of behavior—flight, fight, fright, and sex.

If a neuron (a cell of the nervous system) secretes a chemical messenger that travels a thousandth of an inch and causes the next cell in line (typically, another neuron) to do something different, that messenger is called a neurotransmitter.

This realization gave rise to the memorable cliché that the pituitary is the master gland of the body.

The other, less polished but more honest, said the competition was all that drove him for decades and described his relationship with his co-winner as “many years of vicious attacks and bitter retaliation.”.

(Are you overwhelmed and intimidated by these terms, wondering if you should have bought some Deepak Chopra self-help book instead? Please, don’t even dream of memorizing these names of hormones. The important ones are going to appear so regularly in the coming pages that you will soon be comfortably and accurately slipping them into everyday conversation and birthday cards to favorite cousins. Trust me.).

By the end of this book you will be astonishingly informed about glucocorticoid trivia, since I am in love with these hormones.

Taylor argues convincingly that the physiology of the stress-response can be quite different in females, built around the fact that in most species, females are typically less aggressive than males, and that having dependent young often precludes the option of flight.

Moreover, oxytocin may be critical for a female to form a monogamous pair bond with a male (in the relatively few mammalian species that are monogamous).

For example, while stress causes a prompt decline in the secretion of growth hormone in rats, it causes a transient increase in growth hormone secretion in humans (this puzzle and its implication for humans are discussed in the chapter on growth).

A question no doubt at the forefront of every reader’s mind at this point: if one of the features of the cardiovascular stress-response is to conserve water in the circulation, and this is accomplished by inhibition of urine formation in the kidneys, why is it that when we are really terrified, we wet our pants?.

Basically, your heart is just a dumb, simple mechanical pump, and your blood vessels are nothing more exciting than hoses. The cardiovascular stress-response essentially consists of making them work harder for a while, and if you do that on a regular basis, they will wear out, just like any pump or hose you’d buy at Sears.

In the last few years, it is becoming clear that the amount of damaged, inflamed blood vessels is a better predictor of cardiovascular trouble than is the amount of circulating crud.

Means that your legs and chest hurt like hell for lack of oxygen and glucose whenever you walk; you are then a candidate for bypass surgery.

(reminding one of the oft-quoted statement by Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate writer and Holocaust survivor: “The opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of love is indifference.”).

This is the case among people in non-westernized populations. The disease is not, therefore, a normal feature of aging; instead, it is a disease of inactivity and fat surplus, conditions that just happen to be more common with age in some societies.).

Congratulations, you now have a “functional” GI disorder.

An ulcer is a hole in the wall of an organ, and ulcers originating in the stomach or in the organs immediately bordering it are termed peptic ulcers.

Clinicians celebrated at never having again to sit down with their ulcer patients, make some serious eye contact, and ask them how their lives were going.

There’s nothing like parenthood to make you really neurotic, as you worry about the consequences of your every act, thought, or omission.

You only want perfection for the ones you love beyond words, so you get nutsy at times.

What is childhood about? It is a time when you make assessments about the nature of the world.

“If something is hidden underneath something else, it still exists.”.

“Even if Mommy disappears for a while, she will come back because Mommy always comes back.”.

I will suggest that this arises from having learned at a premature age a deep emotional lesson about the nature of life, namely, that this is a world in which awful things can happen over which you have no control.

Consider a female who is pregnant during a famine. She’s not getting enough calories, nor is her fetus. It turns out that during the latter part of pregnancy, a fetus is “learning” about how plentiful food is in that outside world, and a famine winds up “teaching” it that, jeez, there’s not a whole lot of food out there, better store every smidgen of it. Something about the metabolism of that fetus shifts permanently, a feature called metabolic “imprinting” or “programming.” Forever after, that fetus will be particularly good at storing the food it consumes, at retaining every grain of precious salt from the diet. Forever after, that fetus develops what has been termed a “thrifty” metabolism.

Everything else being equal throughout life, even late in life, that organism is more at risk for hypertension, obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Fetal Origins of Adult Disease.

And then the chapter informs us that the boy became the author of the much-beloved children’s classic—Peter Pan. J. M. Barrie’s writings are filled with children who didn’t grow up, who were fortunate enough to die in childhood, who came back as ghosts to visit their mothers.

To take a concrete, nuts and bolts feature of growth, the rate at which this child was depositing calcium in his long bones could be successfully predicted by his proximity to a loved one.

You can’t ask for a clearer demonstration that what is going on in our heads influences every cell in our bodies.

Sometimes a stressor can be the failure to provide something essential, and the absence of touch is seemingly one of the most marked developmental stressors that we can suffer.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet. In a particular culture, how often is a child typically held by parents, by non-parents? Do babies sleep alone ever and, if so, starting at what age? What is the average length of time that a child cries in a particular culture before she is picked up and comforted?.

Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

An infant human or animal can be well fed, maintained at an adequate temperature, peered at nervously, and ministered to by the best of neonatologists, yet still not thrive. Something is still missing. Perhaps we can even risk scientific credibility and detachment and mention the word love here, because that most ephemeral of phenomena lurks between the lines of this chapter. Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

All the experts believed that affection not only wasn’t needed for development but was a squishy, messy thing that kept kids from becoming upright, independent citizens. Yet young organisms were able to teach about how these savants were wrong in a classic set of studies begun in the 1950s—studies that are, in my opinion, among the most haunting and troubling of all the pages of science.

Kids don’t love their mothers because Mom balances their nutritive intake, these results suggested. They love them because, usually, Mom loves them back, or at least is someone soft to cling to. “Man cannot live by milk alone. Love is an emotion that does not need to be bottle- or spoon-fed,” wrote Harlow.

They have taught us the science of why we primates love individuals who treat us badly, why the mistreatment can at times increase the love. They have taught us about why being abused as a child increases the risk of your being an abusive adult.

The Stress of My Life.

Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

As will be discussed in chapter 9, endorphins play a role in blocking pain perception and are secreted in response to exercise (helping to account for the famed “runner’s high” or “endorphin high” that hits many hardy joggers around the 30-minute mark).

Getting an erection to work properly is so incredibly complicated physiologically that if men ever actually had to understand it, none of us would be here.

This is accomplished by activating his parasympathetic nervous system. In other words, the guy has to be calm, vegetative, relaxed.

(Incredibly complicated choreography between these two systems; don’t try this unsupervised.).

This new understanding generates tricks that sexual therapists advise—if you are close to ejaculating and don’t want to yet, take a deep breath. Expanding the chest muscles briefly triggers a parasympathetic volley that defers the shift from parasympathetic to sympathetic.

Turns out that they are fabulous hunters. And you know what happens? Lions, who are not particularly effective hunters, because they are big and slow and conspicuous, spend most of their time keying in on hyenas and ripping off their kills. No wonder when it’s dawn on the savanna the hyenas on the periphery are looking cranky, with circles under their eyes. They stayed up all night hunting that thing, and who’s having breakfast now?.

This hasn’t yet been demonstrated, but perhaps Berkeley scientists working on this, squandering tax dollars that could otherwise be going to Halliburton and Bechtel, will do.

An enzyme in the fat cells of females usually eliminates these androgens by converting them to estrogens.

There is a small amount of male sex hormone in the bloodstream of females, even non-hyena females.

In human beings, this doesn’t come from the ovaries (as in the hyenas), but from the adrenals. The amount of these “adrenal androgens” is only about 5 percent of that in males, but enough to cause trouble.*.

Scientists have called them the original affluent society.

Instead, they typically act for the good of their own genetic legacy and that of their close relatives.

The evidence for the brain’s influence on the immune system goes back at least a century, dating to the first demonstration that if you waved an artificial rose in front of someone who is highly allergic to roses (and who didn’t know it was a fake), they’d get an allergic response.

Such immune defenses are brought about by a complex array of circulating cells called lymphocytes and monocytes (which are collectively known as white blood cells; cyte is a term for cells).

What the data show: the fewer social relationships a person has, the shorter his or her life expectancy, and the worse the impact of various infectious diseases.

For the same illness, people with the fewest social connections have approximately two-and-a-half times as much chance of dying as those with the most connections, after controlling for such variables as age, gender, and health status.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced. In other words, this stressor is associated with increased mortality in the subset of parents with the added risk factor of minimal social support.

In searching for a link between stress and increased risk of cancer, it may not be surprising to find that women who have spent long periods (decades in these studies) working night shifts have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, the most plausible explanation here has nothing to do with stress. Instead, a shifted day/night schedule dramatically decreases the level of a light-responsive hormone called melatonin, and depletion of this hormone greatly increases the risk of a number of types of cancer, including breast cancer.

Love, Medicine and Miracles.

As the book unfolds, you note that it is a strange world that Siegel inhabits. When operating on anesthetized patients, “I also do not hesitate to ask the [anesthetized] patient not to bleed if circumstances call for it,” he asserts. In his world, deceased patients come back as birds, there are unnamed countries in which individuals consistently live for a century, and best of all, people who have the right spirituality not only successfully fight cancer but can drive cars that consistently break down for other people.

“I feel that all disease is ultimately related to a lack of love”.

Obviously, a theme of this book is just how many things can go wrong in the body because of stress and how important it is for everyone to recognize this.

Now, like an aging Cretaceous dinosaur, I watch these new mammals proliferating.

“how big is a normal thymus?”.

Perhaps the best moral is that when doing science (or perhaps when doing anything at all in a society as judgmental as our own), be very careful and very certain before pronouncing something to be the norm—because at that instant, you have made it supremely difficult to ever again look objectively at an exception to that supposed norm.

However, it turns out that while Yossarian merely does not believe in the existence of a God and is rather angry about the whole concept, the God that she does not believe in is one who is good and warm and loving, and thus she is offended by the.

“How much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?” “Pain?” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. “Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.” “And who created the dangers?” Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. “Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! Why couldn’t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of his celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person’s forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn’t He?” “People would certainly look silly walking around with red neon tubes in the middle of their foreheads.” “They certainly look beautiful now writhing in agony or stupefied with morphine, don’t they?” Unfortunately, we lack neon lights in the middle of our foreheads, and in the absence of such innocuous signs, we probably do need pain perception. Pain can hurt like hell, but it can inform us that we are sitting too close to the fire, or that we should never again eat the novel item that just gave us food poisoning. It effectively discourages us from trying to walk on an injured limb that is better left immobilized until it heals. And in our westernized lives, it is often a good signal that we had better see a doctor before it is too late. People who congenitally lack the ability to feel pain (a condition known as pain asymbolia) are a mess; because they can’t feel pain when they step down with too much force, their feet may ulcerate, their knee joints may disintegrate, and their long bones may crack; they burn themselves unawares; in some cases, they even lose a toe without knowing it. Pain is useful to the extent that it motivates us to modify our behaviors in order to reduce whatever insult is causing the pain, because invariably that insult is damaging our tissues. Pain is useless and debilitating, however, when it is telling us that there is something dreadfully wrong that we can do nothing about. We must praise the fact that we have evolved a physiological system that lets us know when our stomachs are empty. Yet at the same time we must deeply rue our evolving physiological system that can wrack a terminal cancer patient with unrelenting pain. Pain, until we get the lights on our foreheads, will remain a necessary but highly problematic part of our natural physiology. What is surprising is how malleable pain signals are—how readily the intensity of a pain signal is changed by the sensations, feelings, and thoughts that coincide with the pain. One example of this modulation, the blunting of pain perception during some circumstances of stress, is the subject of this chapter.   The Basics of Pain Perception   The sensation of pain originates in receptors located throughout our body. Some are deep within the body, telling us about muscle aches, fluid-filled, swollen joints, or damage to organs. Or even something as mundane as a distended bladder. Others, in our skin, can tell us that we have been cut, burned, abraded, poked, or compressed.* Often, these skin receptors respond to the signal of local tissue damage. Cut yourself with a paring knife, and you will slice open various cells of microscopic size that then spill out their proverbial guts; and, typically, within this cellular soup now flooding out of the area of injury is a variety of chemical messengers.

It turned out that patients who had views of trees from their windows requested significantly less pain medication than those who looked out on blank walls.

Here’s an example that will finally make reading this book worth your while—how to make neurobiology work to your competitive advantage at sports. You’re playing tennis against someone who is beating the pants off of you. Wait until your adversary has pulled off some amazing backhand, then offer a warm smile and say, “You are a fabulous tennis player. I mean it; you’re terrific. Look at that shot you just made. How did you do that? When you do a backhand like that, do you hold your thumb this way or that, and what about your other fingers? And how about your butt, do you scrunch up the left side of it and put your weight on your right toes, or the other way around?” Do it right, and the next time that shot is called for, your opponent/victim will make the mistake of thinking about it explicitly, and the stroke won’t be anywhere near as effective. As Yogi Berra once said, “You can’t think and hit at the same time.” Imagine descending a flight of stairs in an explicit manner, something you haven’t done since you were two years old—okay, bend my left knee and roll the weight of my toes forward while shifting my right hip up slightly—and down you go down the stairs.

As a result, the study of “adult neurogenesis” is now, arguably, the hottest topic in neuroscience.

Woody Allen once said, “My brain is my second-favorite organ.” My guess is that most of us would rank our brains even higher up on a list.

“We can’t do this, we’re going to die, I’m serious, people DIE from lack of sleep, it’s not possible to do this, it’s physiologically proven, we’re all going to DIE.”.

Not getting enough sleep is a stressor; being stressed makes it harder to sleep. Yup, we’ve got a dread vicious cycle on our hands.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional. You breathe underwater, fly in the air, communicate telepathically; you announce your love to strangers, invent languages, rule kingdoms, star in Busby Berkeley musicals.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain. Weirdly, another major reason to sleep is to dream. If you skip a night’s sleep, when you finally get to sleep the next night, you have more REM sleep than normal, suggesting that you’ve built up a real deficit of dreaming.

Both slow wave and REM sleep also seem to play roles in the formation of new memories, the consolidation of information from the previous day, even information that became less accessible to you while awake over the course of the day. One type of evidence supporting this is the fact that if you teach an animal some task and disrupt its sleep that night, the new information isn’t consolidated.

Being exposed to lots of new information during the day is associated with more REM sleep that night.

For example, lots of REM sleep during the night predicts better consolidation of emotional information from the day before, while lots of stage 2 sleep predicts better consolidation of a motor task, and a combination of lots of REM and slow wave sleep predicts better retention of perceptual information.

In 1910, the average American slept nine hours a night, disturbed only by the occasional Model T backfiring. We now average 7.5 and declining. When there’s the lure of 24-hour-a-day fun, activities, and entertainment or, for the workaholic, the knowledge that somewhere, in some time zone, someone else is working while you indulge yourself in sleep, that pull of “just a few more minutes,” of pushing yourself, becomes irresistible. And damaging.

Just when we finally grow up and learn to like ourselves and to love and play, the shadows lengthen. There is so little time.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves. There are types of cognitive skills that improve in old age (these are related to social intelligence and to making good strategic use of facts, rather than merely remembering them easily).

If you want to degenerate very fast, secrete a ton of glucocorticoids.

Live—if you squander a lot of your heartbeats being nervous about blind dates when you’re sixteen, there would be that much less metabolic reserve available to you at eighty.

But this time, when the painful stimulus occurs, the organism under study can reach out for its mommy and cry in her arms. Under these circumstances, this organism shows less of a stress-response.

We humans also deal better with stressors when we have outlets for frustration—punch a wall, take a run, find solace in a hobby. We are even cerebral enough to imagine those outlets and derive some relief: consider the prisoner of war who spends hours imagining a golf game in tremendous detail. I have a friend who passed a prolonged and very stressful illness lying in bed with a mechanical pencil and a notepad, drawing topographic maps of imaginary mountain ranges and taking hikes through them.

It’s a real primate specialty as well. A male baboon loses a fight. Frustrated, he spins around and attacks a subordinate male who was minding his own business.

“He’s one of those guys who doesn’t get ulcers, he gives them.”.

Social support networks—it helps to have a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, an ear to listen to you, someone to cradle you and to tell you it will be okay.

In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular stress-response.

Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher glucocorticoid levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting cortisol levels.

As noted in chapter 8, people with spouses or close friends have longer life expectancies.

If you are a member of an ethnic minority, the fewer members there are of your group in your neighborhood, the higher your risks of mental illness, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide..

The instant the second burst of drilling ends, down goes blood pressure. By being given news about the stressor to come, you are also implicitly being comforted by now knowing what stressors are not coming.

It’s that the temperature in the tropics is 20 degrees colder than anticipated.

Among other reasons, we wish to optimize our coping strategies when we request the most devastating piece of medical information any of us will ever face: “How much time do I have left?”.

Thus, the exercise of control is not critical; rather, it is the belief that you have it.

An everyday example: airplanes are safer than cars, yet more of us are phobic about flying. Why? Because your average driver believes that he is a better-than-average driver, thus more in control. In an airplane, we have no control at all. My wife and I tease each other on plane flights, exchanging control: “Okay, you rest for a while, I’ll take over concentrating on keeping the pilot from having a stroke.”.

Amazingly, the same is seen in a rat—let a rat run voluntarily in a running wheel, and it makes it feel great. Force a rat to do the same amount of exercise and it gets a massive stress-response.

Endless studies have shown that the link between occupational stress and increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is anchored in the killer combination of high demand and low control—you have to work hard, a lot is expected of you, and you have minimal control over the process.

The control element is more powerful than the demand one—low demand and low control is more damaging to one’s health than high demand and high control.

For example, it was only in recent years that orchestra unions won the right for regularly scheduled bathroom breaks during rehearsals, instead of having to wait until the conductor cared to note how squirmy the reed players had become.*.

Being subject to a random act of kindness.

An inappropriate sense of control in the face of awful events can make us feel terrible. Some of our most compassionate words to people experiencing tragedy involve minimizing their perceived sense of control. “It’s not your fault, no one could have stopped in time; she just darted out from between the cars.”.

“If they’d only made the effort to assimilate, they wouldn’t have these problems” (minorities have the power to prevent their persecution).

People with a strong internal locus of control (in other words, people who think they are the masters of their own ship—that what goes on around them reflects their actions) have far greater stress-responses than do those with external loci when confronted with something uncontrollable.

In the next two chapters we will consider psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and personality disorders, in which there’s a bad match between how stressful the real world is and how stressful the person perceives it to be.

Progeria, idiot savants with autism, cannibals with kuru.

Its incidence has been steadily increasing for decades—by the year 2020, depression is projected to be the second leading cause of medical disability on earth.

The defining feature of a major depression is loss of pleasure. If I had to define a major depression in a single sentence, I would describe it as a “genetic/neurochemical disorder requiring a strong environmental trigger whose characteristic manifestation is an inability to appreciate sunsets.”.

None of us will live forever, and on occasion we actually believe it; our days are filled with disappointments, failures, unrequited loves.

This trait is called anhedonia: hedonism is “the pursuit of pleasure,” anhedonia is “the inability to feel pleasure” (also often called dysphoria—I’ll be using the terms interchangeably).

There can be complex layers of these feelings: not just obsessive guilt, for example, about something that has contributed to the depression, but obsessive guilt about the depression itself—what it has done to the sufferer’s family, the guilt of not being able to overcome depression, a life lived but once and wasted amid this disease. Small wonder that, worldwide, depression accounts for 800,000 suicides per year.

An additional vegetative symptom is extremely relevant to this chapter, namely that major depressives often experience elevated levels of glucocorticoids.

In one variant, unipolar depression, the sufferer fluctuates from feeling extremely depressed to feeling reasonably normal.

In another form, the person fluctuates between deep depression and wild, disorganized hyperactivity. This is called bipolar depression or, more familiarly, manic depression.

Or we could describe someone as being in a manic state when he is buoyed by some unexpected good news—talking quickly, laughing, gesticulating.

The best evidence suggests that depression involves abnormal levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.

In one part of the body (the heart, for example), norepinephrine is a messenger concerning arousal and the Four F’s, while in a different part of the nervous system, norepinephrine seems to have something to do with the symptoms of depression.

The best evidence is that most of the drugs that lessen depression increase the amount of signaling by these neurotransmitters.

As mammals, we have large limbic systems; lizards have relatively tiny limbic systems—they are not noted for the complexity of their emotional lives.

Above that is the cortex. Everyone in the animal kingdom has some, but it is a real primate specialty. The cortex does abstract cognition, invents philosophy, remembers where your car keys are. The stuff of the previous chapter.

On an incredibly simplistic level, you can think of depression as occurring when your cortex thinks an abstract negative thought and manages to convince the rest of the brain that this is as real as a physical stressor.

Thus, an astonishingly crude prediction: cut the connections between the cortex and the rest of a depressive’s brain, and the cortex will no longer be able to get the rest of the brain depressed.

And the emotions that the ACC is involved in seem to be negative ones. Induce a positive state in someone by showing something amusing, and ACC metabolism decreases. In contrast, if you electrically stimulate the ACC in people, they feel a shapeless sense of fear and foreboding.

Specifically, activation of the left PFC is associated with positive moods, and activation of the right PFC, with negative.

Thus, not surprisingly, in depressives, there is decreased left PFC activity and elevated activity in the right PFC.

To begin, people who secrete too little thyroid hormone can develop major depressions and, when depressed, can be atypically resistant to antidepressant drugs working.

When something upsetting happens, women are more likely to ruminate over it—think about it or want to talk about it with someone else. And men, terrible communicators that they so often are, are more likely to want to think about anything but the problem, or even better, go and do something—exercise, use power tools, get drunk, start a war. A ruminative tendency, the cognitive psychologists argue, makes you more likely to become depressed.

Share every single gene with someone who is depressive and you still have a 50 percent chance of not having the disease.

Genes are rarely about inevitability, especially when it comes to humans, the brain, or behavior. They’re about vulnerability, propensities, tendencies.

But the key thing is that having version X of this gene Z doesn’t guarantee you get depression, it just increases your risk. And, in fact, knowing nothing more about someone than which version of gene Z she has doesn’t increase your odds of predicting whether she gets depressed. Version X increases depression risk only when coupled with a history of repeated major stressors.

In the case of a major melancholic depression, you have become obsessed with the ambivalence—the simultaneity, the irreconcilable nature of the intense love alongside the intense hatred.

Melancholia—a major depression—Freud theorized, is the internal conflict generated by this ambivalence.

“If only I had said the things I needed to, if only we could have worked things out”—for all of time, you have lost the chance to purge yourself of the ambivalence. For the rest of your life, you will be reaching for the door to let you into a place of pure, unsullied love, and you can never reach that door.

“Face it. We suffer from learned cooking helplessness.”.

If a teacher at a critical point of our education, or a loved one at a critical point of our emotional development, frequently exposes us to his or her own specialized uncontrollable stressors, we may grow up with distorted beliefs about what we cannot learn or ways in which we are unlikely to be loved.

Times were good enough that he wasn’t going to starve, and he had reached the realization that there were things in life more important than fighting your way up the hierarchy.

He has a best friend in their mother, Barbara, and never gives a thought to what he’s turned his back on.

We are ecologically buffered and privileged enough to be stressed mainly over social and psychological matters.

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood.

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood of a bad outcome.

I will attempt to do that reframing below. Instead, they characterized Type-A people as immensely competitive, overachieving, time-pressured, impatient, and hostile. People with that profile, they reported, had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Their work suggested that a persistent sense of insecurity is, in fact, a better predictor of cardiovascular profiles than is hostility, although theirs appears to be a minority view in the field.

In support of that, experimental studies show that the full expression of anger is a powerful stimulant of the cardiovascular system.

By contrast, in the reanalysis of the original Type-A data a particularly powerful predictor of heart disease was not only high degrees of hostility, but also the tendency not to express it when angry.

Run them through the blood and guts, and, with them gripping the arms of their chairs and trying to remain stoic, and still, the sympathetic activation becomes even greater. Repressing the expression of strong emotions appears to exaggerate the intensity of the physiology that goes along with them.

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s.

They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s. They describe themselves as planners who don’t like surprises, who live structured, rule-bound lives—walking to work the same way each day, always wearing the same style of clothes—the sort of people who can tell you what they’re having for lunch two weeks from Wednesday. Not surprisingly, they don’t like ambiguity and strive to set up their world in black and white, filled with good or bad people, behaviors that are permitted or strictly forbidden. They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

A lesson of repressive personality types and their invisible burdens is that, sometimes, it can be enormously stressful to construct a world without stressors.

If the context is one in which that special someone is likely to eventually say yes, her running hot and cold is all that’s needed to start you off on a fifty-year courtship.

Glucocorticoids, those hormones which have been discovered at the scene of the crime for virtually all the stress-related pathology we’ve been learning about, those same villainous glucocorticoids…will trigger the release of dopamine from pleasure pathways.

These are the folks who push every envelope. They spend every last dollar in Monopoly, have furtive sex in public places, try out a new, complicated recipe on important dinner guests, answer the ad in Soldier of Fortune. What’s up with them?.

Food for a hungry rat, sex for a horny one, and dopamine levels rise 50 to 100 percent in this pathway. But give the rat some cocaine and there is a THOUSAND-FOLD increase in dopamine release.

If someone always yells at you, you stop listening. If you flood a synapse with a gazillion times more of a neurotransmitter than is usually the case, the recipient neuron has to compensate by becoming less sensitive.

This is the addictive cycle of escalating drug use.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels. It’s about the motivation to avoid the punishment of not having the drug.

No wonder you feel so awful. Brain-imaging studies of drug users at that stage show that viewing a film of actors pretending to use drugs activates dopamine pathways in the brain more than does watching porn films.

As goes one of the clichés of addiction, there’s really no such thing as an ex-addict—it is simply an addict who is not in the context that triggers use.

The premise of this book is that we humans, especially we westernized humans, have come up with some pretty strange sources of negative emotions—worrying about and being saddened by purely psychological events that are displaced over space and time. But we westernized humans have also come up with some strange sources of positive emotions.

If we were nothing but machines of local homeostatic regulation, as we consume more, we would desire less.

Caveat—when I discuss a way in which stress can make you sick, that is merely shorthand for discussing how stress can make you more likely to get diseases that make you sick.

At the other extreme are the folks anchored in mind-body issues, for whom poor health is about psychological stress, lack of control and efficacy, and so on.

And it has come in the form of criticizing the extremes of both camps: on the one hand, trying to make clear how limiting it is to believe that humans can ever be reduced to a DNA sequence, and on the other, trying to indicate the damaging idiocy of denying the realities of human physiology and disease.

That disease, even the most reductive of diseases, cannot be appreciated without considering the person who is ill.

If we can’t consider disease outside the context of the person who is ill, we also can’t consider it outside the context of the society in which that person has gotten ill, and that person’s place in that society.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,”.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,” he wrote. And, “Physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor.”.

Resources, no matter how plentiful, are rarely divvied up evenly.

You spend hours sweet-talking someone into grooming you, getting rid of those bothersome thorns and nettles and parasites in your hair, and the grooming session can be broken up by someone dominant just for the sheer pleasure of hassling you. Or you could be sitting there, minding your own business, bird-watching, and some high-ranking guy having a bad day decides to make you pay for it by slashing you with his canines.

The answer, overwhelmingly, is that rank emerges first, and drives the distinctive stress profile.

Social subordination equals being chronically stressed equals an overactive stress-response equals more stress-related disease.

Some people always get more of their share of equality than others.

Where people in the community would stop kids from vandalizing a car even if they don’t know whose car it is.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality. In contrast, hierarchy is about domination, not symmetry and equality.

To figure this out, you need some fancy statistical techniques called path analysis.

One more grim example of how this works. America: enormous wealth, enormous income inequality, high crime, the most heavily armed nation on earth. And markedly low levels of social capital—it is virtually the constitutional right of an American to be mobile and anonymous. Show your independence. Move across the country for any job opportunity. (He lives across the street from his parents? Isn’t that a little, er, stunted?) Get a new accent, get a new culture, get a new name, unlist your phone number, reboot your life. All of which are the antitheses of developing social capital. This helps to explain something subtle about the health-income inequality relationship.

Our American credo is that people are willing to tolerate a society with miserably low levels of social capital, so long as there can be massive income inequality…with the hope that they will soon be sitting at the top of this steep pyramid.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight.

Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight. Agriculture allowed for the stockpiling of surplus resources and thus, inevitably, the unequal stockpiling of them—stratification of society and the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think that the punch line of the primate-human difference is that when humans invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low-ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.

Their simple, empowering, liberating message: if manipulating such psychological variables can work in these trying circumstances, it certainly should for the more trivial psychological stressors that fill our daily lives.

It is critical that one not walk away with the conclusion that in order to manage and minimize psychological stressors, the solution is always to have more of a sense of control, more predictability, more outlets, more social affiliation. These principles of stress management work only in certain circumstances. And only for certain types of people with certain types of problems.

Despite the endless ways in which stress can disrupt, we do not all collapse into puddles of stress-related disease and psychiatric dysfunction.

Animals of many different species show some version of giving up on life in the face of something aversive and out of their control.

When it comes to humans who wish to cope with stress and achieve successful aging, you should be sure to pick the right parents’ genes, and the right parents’ socioeconomic status as well.

What if we happen not to be the sort of baboon who looks at the bright side, the person who holds on to hope when others become hopeless, the parent of the child with cancer who somehow psychologically manages the unmanageable?.

As the most obvious example, physical conditioning brought about by regular exercise will lower blood pressure and resting heart rate and increase lung capacity, just to mention a few of its effects.

Among Type-A people, psychotherapy can change not only behaviors but also cholesterol profiles, risk of heart attack, and risk of dying, independent of changes in diet or other physiological regulators of cholesterol. As another example, the pain and stressfulness of childbirth can be modulated by relaxation techniques such as Lamaze.

Exercise is great to counter stress for a number of reasons. First, it decreases your risk of various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and therefore decreases the opportunity for stress to worsen those diseases.

For that reason, I think it would be helpful to put my cards on the table before tackling this subject. I had a highly orthodox religious upbringing and believed devoutly. Except that now I am an atheist, have no room in my life for spirituality of any kind, and believe that religion is phenomenally damaging. Except that I wish I could be religious. Except that it makes no sense to me and I’m baffled by people who believe. Except that I’m also moved by them. So I’m confused. On to the science.

For example, an endless source of tension in heterosexual relationships is that women, on average, tend toward emotion- or relationship-based coping styles, whereas men tend toward problem-solving approaches.

As an idiotic example, suppose there’s a big exam looming. One version of coping with it is to study; another is to reframe the meaning of a bad grade (“There’s more to life than this class, I’m still a good person who is good at other things…”). Obviously before the exam, the stress-reduction-by-studying strategy should dominate, while you should hold off on the stress-reduction-by-reframing approach until after the exam.

80 percent of the stress reduction is accomplished with the first 20 percent of effort. What.

For example, clinically depressed people feel significantly better simply by scheduling a first appointment to see a therapist—it means they’ve recognized there’s a problem, it means they’ve fought their way up through the psychomotor quagmire to actually do something, it means they’ve turned a corner.

Love has a history and we ride – sometimes rather helplessly – on its currents.


# On China (Henry Kissinger)

The American motive for the opening was to put before our people a vision of peace transcending the travail of the Vietnam War and the ominous vistas of the Cold War.

This book is an effort, based in part on conversations with Chinese leaders, to explain the conceptual way the Chinese think about problems of peace and war and international order, and its relationship to the more pragmatic, case-by-case American approach.

The first war had occurred over 1,300 years earlier, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), when China dispatched troops to support an Indian kingdom against an illegitimate and aggressive rival. After China’s intervention, the two countries had enjoyed centuries of flourishing religious and economic exchange. The lesson learned from the ancient campaign, as Mao described it, was that China and India were not doomed to perpetual enmity.

Weeks later the offensive proceeded much as he described: China executed a sudden, devastating blow on the Indian positions and then retreated to the previous line of control, even going so far as to return the captured Indian heavy weaponry.

While other countries were named after ethnic groups or geographical landmarks, China called itself zhongguo—the “Middle Kingdom” or the “Central Country.” 2 Any attempt to understand China’s twentieth-century diplomacy or its twenty-first-century world role must begin—even at the cost of some potential oversimplification—with a basic appreciation of the traditional context.

Chinese today can understand inscriptions written in the age of Confucius; contemporary Chinese books and conversations are enriched by centuries-old aphorisms citing ancient battles and court intrigues.

The famous opening of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a fourteenth-century epic novel treasured by centuries of Chinese (including Mao, who is said to have pored over it almost obsessively in his youth), evokes this continuous rhythm: “The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.”3.

No Chinese leader ever articulated a rationale for why China would want to control the Japanese archipelago.

The borders between China and the surrounding peoples were not so much political and territorial demarcations as cultural differentiations.

“civilization pretending to be a nation-state.”.

As late as 1820, it produced over 30 percent of world GDP—an amount exceeding the GDP of Western.

Almost all empires were created by force, but none can be sustained by it.

Almost all empires were created by force, but none can be sustained by it. Universal rule, to last, needs to translate force into obligation. Otherwise, the energies of the rulers will be exhausted in maintaining their dominance at the expense of their ability to shape the future, which is the ultimate task of statesmanship. Empires persist if repression gives way to consensus.

Not the least exceptional aspect of Chinese culture is that these values were essentially secular in nature. At the time when Buddhism appeared in Indian culture stressing contemplation and inner peace, and monotheism was proclaimed by the Jewish—and, later, Christian and Islamic—prophets with an evocation of a life after death, China produced no religious themes in the Western sense at all. The Chinese never generated a myth of cosmic creation. Their universe was created by the Chinese themselves, whose values, even when declared of universal applicability, were conceived of as Chinese in origin.

[l]ove of kindness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by foolishness. Love of knowledge, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by loose speculation. Love of honesty, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by harmful candour. Love of straightforwardness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by misdirected judgment. Love of daring, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by insubordination. And love for strength of character, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by intractability.

‘those who come modestly are sent off generously.’”.

China did not export its ideas but let others come to seek them.

What was most remarkable about the Chinese approach to international affairs was less its monumental formal pretensions than its underlying strategic acumen and longevity.

The highest aspiration was less to conquer (though China occasionally mounted major military campaigns) than to deter invasion and prevent the formation of barbarian coalitions.

Its goal was not to conquer and subjugate the barbarians but to “rule [them] with a loose rein” (ji mi).

[I]f the tribes are divided among themselves they [will remain] weak and [it will be] easy to hold them in subjection; if the tribes are separated they shun each other and readily obey. We favor one or other [of their chieftains] and permit them to fight each other. This is a principle of political action which asserts: “Wars between the ‘barbarians’ are auspicious for China.”.

They invited other European countries in for the purpose of first stimulating and then manipulating their rivalry.

To give them . . . elaborate clothes and carriages in order to corrupt their eyes; to give them fine food in order to corrupt their mouth; to give them music and women in order to corrupt their ears; to provide them with lofty buildings, granaries and slaves in order to corrupt their stomach . . . and, as for those who come to surrender, the emperor [should] show them favor by honoring them with an imperial reception party in which the emperor should personally serve them wine and food so as to corrupt their mind. These are what may be called the five baits.

A turbulent history has taught Chinese leaders that not every problem has a solution and that too great an emphasis on total mastery over specific events could upset the harmony of the universe.

Rarely did Chinese statesmen risk the outcome of a conflict on a single all-or-nothing clash; elaborate multiyear maneuvers were closer to their style.

Rarely did Chinese statesmen risk the outcome of a conflict on a single all-or-nothing clash; elaborate multiyear maneuvers were closer to their style. Where the Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces emphasizing feats of heroism, the Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage.

If chess is about the decisive battle, wei qi is about the protracted campaign. The chess player aims for total victory. The wei qi player seeks relative advantage. In chess, the player always has the capability of the adversary in front of him; all the pieces are always fully deployed. The wei qi player needs to assess not only the pieces on the board but the reinforcements the adversary is in a position to deploy. Chess teaches the Clausewitzian concepts of “center of gravity” and the “decisive point”—the game usually beginning as a struggle for the center of the board. Wei qi teaches the art of strategic encirclement. Where the skillful chess player aims to eliminate his opponent’s pieces in a series of head-on clashes, a talented wei qi player moves into “empty” spaces on the board, gradually mitigating the strategic potential of his opponent’s pieces. Chess produces single-mindedness; wei qi generates strategic flexibility.

Chinese thinkers developed strategic thought that placed a premium on victory through psychological advantage and preached the avoidance of direct conflict.

Ultimate excellence lies Not in winning Every battle But in defeating the enemy Without ever fighting.

In contrast to the Western approach of treating history as a process of modernity achieving a series of absolute victories over evil and backwardness, the traditional Chinese view of history emphasized a cyclical process of decay and rectification, in which nature and the world can be understood but not completely mastered.

China entered the modern age a singular kind of empire: a state claiming universal relevance for its culture and institutions but making few efforts to proselytize; the wealthiest country in the world but one that was indifferent to foreign trade and technological innovation; a culture of cosmopolitanism overseen by a political elite oblivious to the onset of the Western age of exploration; and a political unit of unparalleled geographic extent that was unaware of the technological and historical currents that would soon threaten its existence.

Count Nikolai Ignatieff, the Czar’s brilliant and devious young plenipotentiary in Beijing, managed to convince the Chinese court that only Russia could secure the evacuation of the Western occupying powers from the Chinese capital, and to convince the Western powers that only Russia could secure Chinese compliance with the treaties.

The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,.

A Communist state, according to Mao, must not turn into a bureaucratic society; the motivating force must be ideology rather than hierarchy.

In pursuit of the Great Harmony, Mao launched the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, which invited public debate and then turned on those intellectuals who practiced it; the Great Leap Forward in 1958, designed to catch up with the West industrially in a three-year period but which led to one of the most pervasive famines in modern history and produced a split in the Communist Party; and the Cultural Revolution in 1966, in which a generation of trained leaders, professors, diplomats, and experts were sent to the countryside to work on farms to learn from the masses.

Only a people as resilient and patient as the Chinese could emerge unified and dynamic after such a roller coaster ride through history.

Stalin was by now beyond ideology. His leadership was instead marked by a ruthless, cynical Machiavellianism based on his brutal interpretation of Russian national history.

The efficacy of the threat is measured by things that do not happen, that is, the wars being avoided.

His motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.

Wherever possible, he strove for the initiative. On one level, this was similar to the Western concept of preemption—anticipating an attack by launching the first blow. But in the Western doctrine, preemption seeks victory and a military advantage. Mao’s approach to preemption differed in the extraordinary attention he paid to psychological elements. His motivating force was less to inflict a decisive military first blow than to change the psychological balance, not so much to defeat the enemy as to alter his calculus of risks.

As we shall see in the later chapters, Chinese actions in the Taiwan Strait Crises of 1954–58, the Indian border clash of 1962, the conflict with the Soviets along the Ussuri River in 1969–71, and the Sino-Vietnam War of 1979 all had the common feature of a sudden blow followed quickly by a political phase.

In the West, the Cold War and the destructiveness of nuclear weapons have produced the concept of deterrence: to pose risks of destruction to a potential aggressor out of proportion to any possible gain. The efficacy of the threat is measured by things that do not happen, that is, the wars being avoided.

OTTO VON BISMARCK, probably the greatest diplomat of the second half of the nineteenth century, once said that in a world order of five states, it is always desirable to be part of a group of three. Applied to the interplay of three countries, one would therefore think that it is always desirable to be in a group of two.

Mao added a novel dimension to power politics, one for which I know of no precedent. Far from seeking the support of either superpower—as traditional balance-of-power theory would have counseled—he exploited the Soviet-U.S. fear of each other by challenging each of the rivals simultaneously.

Almost all postcolonial countries have insisted on the borders within which they achieved independence. To throw them open to negotiations invites unending controversies and domestic pressure. On the principle that he was not elected to bargain away territory that he considered indisputably Indian, Nehru rejected.

“A person sleeping in a comfortable bed is not easily roused by someone else’s snoring.”.

In meetings of the Central Military Commission and of top leaders, Mao commented on Nehru’s Forward Policy with one of his epigrams: “A person sleeping in a comfortable bed is not easily roused by someone else’s snoring.”.

Since Nehru sticks his head out and insists on us fighting him, for us not to fight with him would not be friendly enough. Courtesy emphasizes reciprocity.

“For a communist the minimum requirement is that he should make a clear distinction between the enemy and ourselves, that he should be ruthless towards the enemy and kind to his own comrades.”.

Deng Xiaoping, the principal leader of China from 1979 to 1991, argued that the Cultural Revolution had nearly destroyed the Communist Party as an institution and wrecked its credibility at least temporarily.

Cherish its hates and threaten its neighbors. There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.”.

# The Ride of a Lifetime (Robert Iger;)

I’d been in Shanghai for two weeks and was running on adrenaline.

In the sixty-one years since Walt Disney built Disneyland in Anaheim, California, we’d opened parks in Orlando and Paris and Tokyo and Hong Kong.

The bond you form in high-stress moments like this, when you’re sharing information that you can’t discuss with anyone else, is a powerful one.

I’m often asked what aspect of the job most keeps me up at night. The honest answer is that I don’t agonize over the work very much. I don’t know if it’s a quirk of brain chemistry, or a defense mechanism I developed in reaction to some family chaos in my youth, or the result of years of discipline—some combination of all of those things, I suppose—but I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry.

I don’t know if it’s a quirk of brain chemistry, or a defense mechanism I developed in reaction to some family chaos in my youth, or the result of years of discipline—some combination of all of those things, I suppose—but I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry. And I tend to approach bad news as a problem that can be worked through and solved, something I have control over rather than something happening to me. But I’m also all too aware of the symbolic power of Disney as a target, and the one thing that weighs heavily on me is the knowledge that no matter how vigilant we are, we can’t prepare for everything.

Sometimes, even though you’re “in charge,” you need to be aware that in the moment you might have nothing to add, and so you don’t wade in. You trust your people to do their jobs and focus your energies on some other pressing issue.

Tender Is the Night or For Whom the Bell Tolls or dozens of others and devour them, and he’d urge me to read even more.

He was always deeply politically engaged and had a very strong liberal bias.

He had a fierce sense of what was right and fair, and he was always on the side of the underdog.

Those hours aren’t for everyone, but however you find the time, it’s vital to create space in each day to let your thoughts wander beyond your immediate job responsibilities, to turn things over in your mind in a less pressured, more creative way than is possible once the daily triage kicks in.

We’ve become much more aware of the need for fair, equal, non-abusive treatment in the workplace, but it has taken too long.

I spent the hundred dollars almost immediately, but the lighter sits in a drawer in my desk to this day.

The show was more important to Roone than to the people who made it, and you had to make peace with that if you worked for him.

After a moment of stunned silence, I said, “Well, some days I feel like it’s tough just keeping my head above water.” Roone looked straight ahead. Without missing a beat, he said, “Get a longer snorkel.”.

It’s a delicate thing, finding the balance between demanding that your people perform and not instilling a fear of failure in them.

In my early days, I thought there was only one lesson in this story, the obvious one about the importance of taking responsibility when you screw up.

In your work, in your life, you’ll be more respected and trusted by the people around you if you honestly own up to your mistakes. It’s impossible not to make them; but it is possible to acknowledge them, learn from them, and set an example that it’s okay to get things wrong sometimes. What’s not okay is to undermine others by lying about something or covering your own ass first.

It’s so simple that you might think it doesn’t warrant mentioning, but it’s surprisingly rare: Be decent to people.

It’s so simple that you might think it doesn’t warrant mentioning, but it’s surprisingly rare: Be decent to people. Treat everyone with fairness and empathy. This doesn’t mean that you lower your expectations or convey the message that mistakes don’t matter. It means that you create an environment where people know you’ll hear them out, that you’re emotionally consistent and fair-minded, and that they’ll be given second chances for honest mistakes. (If they don’t own up to their mistakes, or if they blame someone else, or if the mistake is the result of some unethical behavior, that’s a different story, and something that shouldn’t be tolerated.).

There’s a related lesson, though, that I only came to fully appreciate years later, when I was in a position of real leadership.

But years later, when I was given the chance to lead, I was instinctively aware of both the need to strive for perfection and the pitfalls of caring only about the product and never the people.

He knew what he didn’t know.

(Warren Buffett later called them “probably the greatest two-person combination in management that the world has ever seen or maybe ever will see”),.

In part this is just garden-variety ambition.

My instinct throughout my career has always been to say yes to every opportunity. In part this is just garden-variety ambition. I wanted to move up and learn and do more, and I wasn’t going to forgo any chance to do that, but I also wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of doing things that I was unfamiliar with.

They would talk about valuing ability more than experience, and they believed in putting people in roles that required more of them than they knew they had in them.

“We want you to survive here, Bob. We hope when you’re done you’ll be carrying your shield and not being carried out on it!”.

They would have been completely justified in their disdain for the guy who knew nothing about their business but was about to be their boss. Instead, they were two of the most supportive people I’ve ever worked with, and their support started that first night.

They would have been completely justified in their disdain for the guy who knew nothing about their business but was about to be their boss. Instead, they were two of the most supportive people I’ve ever worked with, and their support started that first night. I told them over dinner that I needed their help. They knew the business, and I didn’t, but our fates were intertwined now, and I hoped they would be willing to be patient with me as I learned on the job. “Don’t worry, Bob. We’ll teach you,” Stu said. “It’ll be great. Trust us.”.

There’s nothing less confidence-inspiring than a person faking a knowledge they don’t possess.

There’s nothing less confidence-inspiring than a person faking a knowledge they don’t possess. True authority and true leadership come from knowing who you are and not pretending to be anything else.

Empathy is a prerequisite to the sound management of creativity, and respect is critical.

It’s a small gesture, but I remember how it felt to be the overlooked sidekick, and anything that reminds you that you’re not the center of the universe is a good thing.

My old mentors—Roone in News, Dennis Swanson in Sports—were now reporting to me. Ted Harbert, who along with Stu Bloomberg had.

Trajectory. I wouldn’t as a rule recommend promoting someone as rapidly as they promoted me, but I will say one more time, because it bears repeating: The way they conveyed their faith in me at every step made all the difference in my success.

“Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year!”.

When the two people at the top of a company have a dysfunctional relationship, there’s no way that the rest of the company beneath them can be functional.

Attentive. You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to learn and absorb. You have to hear out other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of being a great manager.

I’ve been asked a lot over the years about the best way to nurture ambition—both one’s own and that of the people you manage. As a leader, you should want those around you to be eager to rise up and take on more responsibility, as long as dreaming about the job they want doesn’t distract them from the job they have.

As a leader, you should want those around you to be eager to rise up and take on more responsibility, as long as dreaming about the job they want doesn’t distract them from the job they have. You can’t let ambition get too far ahead of opportunity. I’ve seen a lot of people who had their sights set on a particular job or project, but the opportunity to actually get that thing was so slim. Their focus on the small thing in the distance became a problem. They grew impatient with where they were. They didn’t tend enough to the responsibilities they did have, because they were longing so much for something else, and so their ambition became counterproductive. It’s important to know how to find the balance—do the job you have well; be patient; look for opportunities to pitch in and expand and grow; and make yourself one of the people, through attitude and energy and focus, that your bosses feel they have to turn to when an opportunity arises.

Conversely, if you’re a boss, these are the people to nurture—not the ones who are clamoring for promotions and complaining about not being utilized enough but the ones who are proving themselves to be indispensable day in and day out.

We all want to believe we’re irreplaceable. The trick is to be self-aware enough that you don’t cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job. At its essence, good leadership isn’t about being indispensable; it’s about helping others be prepared to possibly step into your shoes—giving them access to your own decision making, identifying the skills they need to develop and helping them improve, and, as I’ve had to do, sometimes being honest with them about why they’re not ready for the next step up.

He understood that “great” is often a collection of very small things, and he helped me appreciate that even more deeply.

“Bob, you know you did that, but the world doesn’t need to know, so shut up!”).

Then our largest shareholder, the Bass family, were forced to sell a massive amount of Disney stock—135 million shares, worth about $2 billion—to cover a margin call, which precipitated another steep drop in our share price.

No one could have handled the stress that Michael was under perfectly, but optimism in a leader, especially in challenging times, is so vital. Pessimism leads to paranoia, which leads to defensiveness, which leads to risk aversion.

The tone you set as a leader has an enormous effect on the people around you. No one wants to follow a pessimist.

He was largely responsible for bringing Michael on as CEO and chairman of the board, and along with all shareholders, he benefited greatly under Michael’s leadership. Between 1984 and 1994, Disney’s annual profits quadrupled, and its stock price increased 1,300 percent.

On a lesser but maybe more illustrative note, he got very angry one Christmas season when we decided to sell pure white Mickey Mouse plush dolls in our Disney stores. “Mickey is only these colors, black and white and red and yellow, and that’s it!” Roy raged in emails to Michael and me. He wanted the “albino Mickeys,” as he called them, taken from the shelves, which we didn’t do, but it was a huge distraction.

It’s only about the future.

Response could simply and honestly be: “I can’t do anything about the past. We can talk about lessons learned, and we can make sure we apply those lessons going forward. But we don’t get any do-overs. You want to know where I’m going to take this company, not where it’s been. Here’s my plan.”.

“Stop talking. Once you have that many of them, they’re no longer priorities.” Priorities are the few things that you’re going to spend a lot of time and a lot of capital on. Not only do you undermine their significance by having too many, but nobody is going to remember them all. “You’re going to seem unfocused,” he said. “You only get three. I can’t tell you what those three should be. We don’t have to figure that out today. You never have to tell me what they are if you don’t want to. But you only get three.”.

A company’s culture is shaped by a lot of things, but this is one of the most important—you have to convey your priorities clearly and repeatedly. In my experience, it’s what separates great managers from the rest.

Time and energy and capital get wasted. People in your organization suffer unnecessary anxiety because they don’t know what they should be focused on. Inefficiency sets in, frustration builds up, morale sinks.

You can do a lot for the morale of the people around you (and therefore the people around them) just by taking the guesswork out of their day-to-day life.

It’s so easy to get caught up in rumor mills, to worry about this person’s perception of you or that person’s, what someone might say or write about you. It’s easy to become defensive and petty and to want to lash out when you feel you’re being unfairly misrepresented. I didn’t believe I deserved this job; I didn’t think I was entitled to it, but I did believe I was right for it.

It’s easy to be optimistic when everyone is telling you you’re great. It’s much harder, and much more necessary, when your sense of yourself is being challenged, and in such a public way.

Don’t let your ego get in the way of making the best possible decision.

If you approach and engage people with respect and empathy, the seemingly impossible can become real.

Team. You can’t wear your disdain for people on your sleeve, though.

No matter how much data you’ve been given, it’s still, ultimately, a risk, and the decision to take that risk or not comes down to one person’s instinct.

I can’t imagine what he must have felt. He’d come in two decades earlier and saved the company, and now he was driving away knowing that his era was over and that the place that he had turned into the largest entertainment company in the world would keep going on without him. It’s one of those moments, I imagine, when it’s hard to know who exactly you are without this attachment and title and role that has defined you for so long.

“The average tenure for a Fortune 500 CEO is less than four years.”.

One of the things I’ve always instinctively felt—and something that was greatly reinforced working for people like Roone and Michael—is that long shots aren’t usually as long as they seem.

Steve said he loved whiteboard exercises, where an entire vision—all the thoughts and designs and calculations—could be drawn out, at the whim of whoever held the felt pen.

Another lesson: Steve was great at weighing all sides of an issue and not allowing negatives to drown out positives, particularly for things he wanted to accomplish. It was a powerful quality of his.

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.”.

(“I hate them more than I hate videogames,” he told me),.

“You can’t think of me as that. That’s insulting. I’m just a good friend.”.

There’s no good playbook for how to fire someone, though I have my own internal set of rules. You have to do it in person, not over the phone and certainly not by email or text. You have to look the person in the eye. You can’t use anyone else as an excuse. This is you making a decision about them—not them as a person but the way they have performed in their job—and they need and deserve to know that it’s coming from you. You can’t make small talk once you bring someone in for that conversation. I normally say something along the lines of: “I’ve asked you to come in here for a difficult reason.” And then I try to be as direct about the issue as possible, explaining clearly and concisely what wasn’t working and why I didn’t think it was going to change.

I emphasize that it was a tough decision to make, and that I understand that it’s much harder on them. There’s a kind of euphemistic corporate language that is often deployed in those situations, and it has always struck me as offensive. There’s no way for the conversation not to be painful, but at least it can be honest, and in being honest there is at least a chance for the person on the receiving end to understand why it’s happening and eventually move on, even if they walk out of the room angry as hell.

The worst thing you can do when entering into a negotiation is to suggest or promise something because you know the other person wants to hear it, only to have to reverse course later.

Did we have the stomach to start cannibalizing our own still-profitable businesses in order to begin building a new model? Could we disrupt ourselves, and would Wall Street tolerate the losses that we would inevitably incur as we tried to truly modernize and transform the company? We.

Did we have the stomach to start cannibalizing our own still-profitable businesses in order to begin building a new model? Could we disrupt ourselves, and would Wall Street tolerate the losses that we would inevitably incur as we tried to truly modernize and transform the company?.

So the next question was: Do we build a tech platform or do we buy one?.

(Although I did believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.).

“If something doesn’t feel right to you, then it’s probably not right for you.”.

“Collectively, you mean the world to me,” he wrote, “and I deeply apologize if I have let you down. I especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form. No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.”.

Your confidence can easily tip over into overconfidence and become a liability.

“I never dreamed I would one day lead the company responsible for so many of my greatest childhood memories,”.

Maybe this is the case for many of us: No matter who we become or what we accomplish, we still feel that we’re essentially the kid we were at some simpler time long ago. Somehow that’s the trick of leadership, too, I think, to hold on to that awareness of yourself even as the world tells you how powerful and important you are. The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you’ve lost your way. That may be the hardest but also the most necessary lesson to keep in mind, that wherever you are along the path, you’re the same person you’ve always been.

You often have to sit through meetings that, if given the choice, you might choose not to sit through. You have to listen to other people’s problems and help find solutions. It’s all part of the job.

You have to be self-aware enough that you don’t cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job.

A company’s reputation is the sum total of the actions of its people and the quality of its products.

“Great” is often a collection of very small things, after all.

Optimism emerges from faith in yourself and in the people who work for you. It’s not about saying things are good when they’re not, and it’s not about conveying some blind faith that “things will work out.”.

Long shots aren’t usually as long as they seem.

Treating others with respect is an undervalued currency when it comes to negotiating.

When hiring, try to surround yourself with people who are good in addition to being good at what they do.

It’s not good to have power for too long. You don’t realize the way your voice seems to boom louder than every other voice in the room. You get used to people withholding their opinions until they hear what you have to say.

It’s not good to have power for too long. You don’t realize the way your voice seems to boom louder than every other voice in the room. You get used to people withholding their opinions until they hear what you have to say. People are afraid to bring ideas to you, afraid to dissent, afraid to engage.

You have to approach your work and life with a sense of genuine humility.

The moment you start to believe it all too much, the moment you look at yourself in the mirror and see a title emblazoned on your forehead, you’ve lost your way.

It was Roone who taught me: Innovate or die..


# The To-Do List (Mike Gayle)

The answer, to me at least, is simple: love. I’m doing it all for love. Because no matter how you say it and how often it gets said, actions will always speak louder than words and right now, though some might call it pointless, frivolous, or just plain stupid, flying to the other side of the Atlantic for the sake of a $12 coffee mug is the one thing I want to say in the loudest possible way.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh. ‘Did I leave anything out?’.

Would a ‘proper adult’ have underwear in active service that was well over a decade old?.

After sweeping a pile of discarded newspapers and sweet wrappers onto the floor, I settled myself at my desk and in large capital letters wrote the words that would change my life: ‘TO-DO LIST.’.

To me a list is a statement of intent, a plan, a map to point you in the right direction. Without my To-Do Lists I’d be lost. Without my To-Do Lists I would just be making stuff up as I went along and that, as far as I’m concerned, is no way to live a life.

My early To-Do Lists tended to be lists of books that I wanted to read, and each time I read one I got a tick. Now, while the writing of a list can be a reward in itself, as any veteran To-Do Lister will attest, the real pay-off is the satisfaction that comes from ticking, crossing, or scribbling an item off your list. With one neat action a task that has been bugging you for the longest time is utterly obliterated. Pow! It’s gone. Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.

With one neat action a task that has been bugging you for the longest time is utterly obliterated. Pow! It’s gone. Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.        Soon after reaching secondary school in the early eighties, I came to realise that the making of To-Do Lists wasn’t just an idle pastime but rather a means of survival, the significance of which I learned the hard way.

‘Unless you’re dead there’s always going to be stuff that needs doing.’.

Canadians appear to be not only incredibly sensible but also really nice. Trust me, every home should have one.

I share this story in order to illustrate an important fact about myself: when it comes to an undertaking, I am the very definition of: ‘Act first. Think later’. And the To-Do List was no exception.

My first step was to head for the shops in the hope that purchasing useful things would miraculously change my life.

Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask,.

‘Organise book shelves so that you can find a specific book without looking through everything’).

‘Since we’re talking lists, I will tell you something that I don’t tell many people because they’d laugh at me: I make To-Do Lists all the time and sometimes when I’m feeling particularly low I put things like “Take a shower” just to have the satisfaction of ticking it off. It’s my kick-start for the day.’.

In fact I would break them up into the things that you’re excited about and the things that you’re not so excited about and then alternate them so there’s always something to look forward to. It’s like eating your pudding before your tea. If you do, there’s no incentive to eat your tea.’.

I encourage people to put on their list to “think” about things and “explore” so that the list is creative in itself.’.

‘That’s easy. The best thing is to tell every single person you know what you’re doing so that you commit yourself fully to the project.’.

7. To make sure Gayle doesn’t give up halfway, there will be an audit at the end of April just to make sure that he’s on track.

‘How can I go back to sleep when you’ve just told me there’s nothing to worry about?’ She too sat bolt upright. ‘What is it exactly that I shouldn’t be worrying about?’        ‘The To-Do List,’ I replied.

‘Good, we’re on the same page then. Now, listen, Mike, I love you, you know I do, but right now I really, really, really have to go to sleep. So if you wake me up again with any more revelations I can’t be held responsible for my actions, okay?’        ‘Yeah,’ I replied. ‘Okay.’.

‘All I know is this: you might have given up the List but the List doesn’t seem to have given up on you.’.

We hadn’t always been the people we were now.

Some things he ticked off the list and some things he didn’t.

‘La, la, la, I’m not listening! La, la, la! You think I’m listening but I’m not!’.

As those months became two years I began to wonder whether I was suffering from some kind of mental illness which led me to confuse the act of cancelling my direct debit with dumping a particularly tear prone girlfriend.

Step 1) present the person/multinational you wish to leave with an insurmountable problem that explains why you want to call it off. Step 2) cross your fingers and hope that they can’t come up with a solution.

‘Because I don’t want to be calm! I’ve just had the phone put down on me! Have you any idea how outrageous that is? What kind of world do we live in where people can put phones down on other people just because they’re recording phone calls? This isn’t Communist-era eastern Germany you know? I’ve got rights! This is England!’.

“Catch up with lost friends because you know what? They used to be great friends”.’.

‘Because when you’re a man, ignorance isn’t just bliss. It’s also the stuff that keeps the walls from falling down.’.

‘Start losing weight before you end up in a Channel Five documentary about fat people so huge that they have to be winched out of bed by helicopter’.

‘Okay, then it has to be receiving murderous phone calls on stormy nights only to call the operator and be told that they’re coming from inside the house!’.

Claire referring to our children as my children was a bad sign. I was in big trouble.

Love you, you know,’ I whispered in her ear. ‘A lot of women would make a big deal about their husbands clearing off around the world at the drop of a hat so it’s really cool that you’re being so understanding.’.

‘We’ll deal with it when we deal with it but I’m making no promises that it will be okay.’.

I couldn’t believe it. It had only been a couple of months since I’d made her a grandmother for the second time and she was already holding out for more? Was no number of grandchildren enough to sate this woman?.

‘So you were hoping Claire and I would have another baby just so that they didn’t go to waste?’.

This is the twenty-first century, babe. Real men moisturise.’.

‘Be nicer to wife because it’ll only be a matter of time before she compares notes with her mates and finally works out what kind of a rough deal she’s on’,.

‘It feels a bit girlie. I told Claire that real men moisturise but I’m pretty sure they don’t. Other than shower gel, deodorant, aftershave and a bit of toothpaste, real men don’t do toiletries.’.

Peace.        War and Peace (Item 1021) had been on my mental To-Do List for some years now. Having first been introduced to the novel by my secondary school English teacher, Mrs Parker, who hailed it as a ‘must read classic’, at the age of thirteen I had searched it out from my local library and had been stunned to discover that it was roughly the same size and density as a house brick.

War and Peace (Item 1021) had been on my mental To-Do List for some years now. Having first been introduced to the novel by my secondary school English teacher, Mrs Parker, who hailed it as a ‘must read classic’, at the age of thirteen I had searched it out from my local library and had been stunned to discover that it was roughly the same size and density as a house brick.

I’d think to myself, one day I really must get around to reading that and while novels that I had previously put into that category, like Slaughter House Five and On The Road, got read, when it came to War and Peace I always seemed to find something more pressing to do. This time was going to be different. This time I was going to give Tolstoy my very best shot.

I don’t know how but I can tell that even from behind her sunglasses Claire is rolling her eyes.

‘I think that it’s probably an okay book if you’re into Russian literature but most people read War and Peace because it’s a big fat book that gets name dropped a lot as a shorthand signifier of supposed intellectual greatness.

George Leigh Mallory wanted to climb Mount Everest: ‘Because it’s there.’.

It was like that maxim of Karl Marx that a man should be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner without permanently becoming hunter, fisherman, cowherd or critic.

I needed to do something special for her.

I needed to do something special for her. Something to demonstrate that I really did think she was the best woman in the world. Three days later I hit the jackpot.

This is trying my patience to the extent that I am verbally abusing both the computer and the printer with the threat of violence.

I am wishing that someone would invent a machine that would just do the things that you want it to do without you having to get involved with any of it. 2.05 p.m. I’ve just repeated my invention wish to Claire. She tells me I’ve already got one: ‘It’s called a wife and it’s how ninety per cent of the things that need doing in our house actually get done.’.

‘Try to make friends with new and interesting people so that you don’t spend your whole life talking about films, music and last week’s episode of Dr Who.’ Just.

It was more than that. It was hopes and dreams and me getting a life and being a proper grown-up.’.

‘Freud would say that there are no accidents and that it was probably your sub-conscious mind’s way of saying you’re getting sick of all this To-Do-List stuff.’        ‘Well, it’s a good job that Freud isn’t here otherwise I’d have to tell him he was quite wrong and the last thing I’d want to do is offend the father of modern psychoanalysis by telling him he was talking cobblers.’.

‘So why are you crying then?’        ‘I’m not,’ she said, wiping her eyes. ‘You must be seeing things.’.

‘I feel stupid because it happened ages ago and I should have said something at the time but I didn’t want to seem petty, but the fact is you hurt my feelings and I think you ought to know why.’.

‘Because even if I’m not the most efficient person in the world – which I admit I’m not – it would be nice if there were one person in the world who thinks I’m great at everything.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’ I paused and added a timely, ‘I love you, you know.’.

‘Do you know what, Simon?’ I began, ‘I think I really am. I had a problem with it before because I thought it would end up just being about a bloke ticking things off a list. I can see now that it will actually be about lots of other stuff too like family and friendship, overcoming obstacles, growing up, taking risks and learning about the things you’re really capable of.’.


# All the Bright Places (Jennifer Niven)

The world breaks everyone, and afterward, many are strong at the broken places. —Ernest Hemingway.


# Crime and Punishment (Transl. Richard Pevear, Larissa Volokhonsky) (Fyodor Dostoevsky)

He was so immersed in himself and had isolated himself so much from everyone that he was afraid not only of meeting his landlady but of meeting anyone at all.

“Hm...yes...man has it all in his hands, and it all slips through his fingers from sheer cowardice...That is an axiom...I wonder, what are people most afraid of? A new step, their own new word, that's what they're most afraid of...I babble too much, however. That's why I don't do anything, because I babble. However, maybe it's like this: I babble because I don't do anything. I've learned to babble over this past month, lying in a corner day in and day out, thinking about...cuckooland. Why on earth am I going now? Am I really capable of that? Is that something serious? No, not serious at all. I'm just toying with it, for the sake of fantasy. A plaything! Yes, a plaything, if you like!”.

With one's dress. The proximity of the Haymarket,.

Descending a flight of stairs from somewhere, his foppish.

Flight of stairs.

We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.

“May I venture, my dear sir, to engage you in a conversation of decency?.

Did you ever happen to spend your nights on the Neva, on the hay barges?”.

This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home.

This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home. Hence, in a company of drinkers, they always seem eager to solicit justification for themselves and, if possible, even respect as well.

Marmeladov had long been a familiar there. And his penchant for ornate speech he had probably acquired as a result of his habit of frequent tavern conversation with various strangers. This habit turns into a necessity for certain drunkards, mostly those who are treated harshly and ordered about at home. Hence, in a company of drinkers, they always seem eager to solicit justification for themselves and, if possible, even respect as well.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere!.

“And what if there is no one else, if there is nowhere else to go! It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere! When my only-begotten daughter went out for the first time with a yellow pass,[5] and I went, too, then...(for my daughter lives on a yellow pass, sir...),” he added parenthetically, glancing somewhat worriedly at the young man. “Never mind, my dear sir, never mind!” he hastened to declare at once and with apparent calm, when both lads at the counter snorted and the proprietor himself smiled.

“Never mind, sir. I am not troubled by this wagging of heads, for everything is already known to everyone, and everything hidden will be made manifest;.

“Never mind, sir. I am not troubled by this wagging of heads, for everything is already known to everyone, and everything hidden will be made manifest;[6] I regard it not with disdain, but with humility. Let it be! Let it be! 'Behold the man!'[7] Excuse me, young man, but can you...Or, no, to expound it more forcefully and more expressively: not can you, but would you venture, looking upon me at this hour, to say of me affirmatively that I am not a swine?”.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it. It is for this I drink, that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling.

Do I not feel it? And the more I drink, the more I feel it. It is for this I drink, that in drinking I may seek compassion and feeling. It is not joy I seek, but sorrow only...I drink, for I wish doubly to suffer!”.

“Young man,” he continued, unbending again, “in your face I read, as it were, a certain sorrow. I read it when you entered, and therefore I addressed you at once. For by telling you the story of my life, I do not wish to expose myself to disgrace before these lovers of idleness, who know everything anyway, but am seeking a sensitive and educated man. Know, then, that my spouse was educated in an aristocratic provincial institute for the nobility and at her graduation danced with a shawl before the governor and other notables,[8] for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal...well, we sold the medal...long ago...hm...the certificate of merit is still lying in her trunk, she showed it to our landlady just recently. And though she is in the most ceaseless strife with our landlady, still she wished to feel proud before someone at least and to tell of the happy days gone by. And I do not judge, I do not judge, for this is the last thing left to her in her memories, and the rest has all gone to ruin! Yes, yes, she is a hot, proud, and unbending lady. She washes the floors herself and eats black bread, but disrespect for herself she will not tolerate. That is why she would not let Mr. Lebezyatnikov get away with his rudeness, and when Mr. Lebezyatnikov gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed, not so much from the beating as from emotion. She came to me already a widow, with three children, each one smaller than the next. She had married her first husband, an infantry officer, out of love, and eloped with him from her parental home. She loved her husband exceedingly, but he got into card-playing, was taken to court, and thereupon died. He used to beat her towards the end; and though she would not let him get away with it, as I am informed of a certainty and with documents, yet to this day she remembers him with tears and holds him up to me in reproach—and I am glad, I am glad, for at least in her imaginings she beholds herself as having once been happy...And after him she was left with three young children in a remote and savage district, where I was living at the time, and she was left in such hopeless destitution.

'What, Katerina Ivanovna, must I really go and do such a thing?' And Darya Frantsevna, an ill-meaning woman and one oft-known to the police, had already made inquiries three times through the landlady. 'And what,' Katerina Ivanovna answered mockingly, 'what's there to save? Some treasure!' But do not blame her, do not blame her, my dear sir, do not blame her! She said this not in her right mind but in emotional agitation, in sickness, and with the children crying from hunger, and said it, besides, more for the sake of the insult than in any strict sense...For such is Katerina Ivanovna's character, and when the children get to crying, even if it's from hunger, she starts beating them at once.

Ill-meaning persons—which Darya Frantsevna especially abetted,.

'You sweet little thing!’”.

Do you think, wine-merchant, that this bottle of yours brought me sweetness? Sorrow, sorrow I sought at its bottom, sorrow and tears, and I tasted it and found it;.

'Come! I have already forgiven you once...I have forgiven you once...And now, too, your many sins are forgiven, for you have loved much[15]...'.

“It's not Katerina Ivanovna I'm afraid of now,” he muttered in agitation, “and not that she'll start pulling my hair. Forget the hair! ... The hair's nonsense! I can tell you! It's even better if she starts pulling it; that's not what I'm afraid of...I...it's her eyes I'm afraid of...yes...her eyes... I'm also afraid of the flushed spots on her cheeks, and also—her breathing . .. Have you ever seen how people with that illness breathe...when their feelings are aroused? And I'm afraid of the children's crying, too...Because if Sonya hasn't been feeding them, then...I don't know what! I really don't! And I'm not afraid of a beating...Know, sir, that such beatings are not only not painful, but are even a delight to me...For I myself cannot do without them. It's better. Let her beat me, to ease her soul...it's better...Here's the house. Kozel's house. A locksmith, a German, a rich one...take me in!”.

Wept a bit and got accustomed. Man gets accustomed to everything, the scoundrel!”.

“But if that's a lie”,” he suddenly exclaimed involuntarily, “if man in fact is not a scoundrel—in general, that is, the whole human race—then the rest is all mere prejudice, instilled fear, and there are no barriers, and that's just how it should be!.

Nastasya simply dissolved in laughter. She was the sort much given to laughter, and when something made her laugh, she laughed inaudibly, heaving and shaking her whole body, until she made herself sick.

Even in the most extreme situations she can find enough magnanimity in herself so as not to lose her firmness.

You know how I love you; you are all we have, Dunya.

And besides, if one wants to know any man well, one must consider him gradually and carefully, so as not to fall into error and prejudice, which are very difficult to correct and smooth out later.

Dunya, besides being an intelligent girl, is at the same time a noble being, like an angel, and will regard it as her duty to ensure the happiness of her husband, who in turn would be looking out for her happiness, and this last point, so far, we have no great reason to doubt, though one must admit that the matter has been done a bit too quickly.

A husband ought to owe nothing to his wife, but it is much better if a wife looks upon her husband as a benefactor.

'words are not yet deeds,'.

In order to judge a man, one must first observe him more closely, and that he would leave it to himself to form an opinion of you after making your acquaintance.

I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands do not much warm up to their mothers-in-law, and I not only do not want to be even the slightest burden to anyone, but I also want to be fully free myself, as long as I have at least a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dunechka.

Bread and butter for all, but bring your own tobacco, as the saying goes.

He kept tormenting and taunting himself with these questions, even taking a certain delight in it. None of the questions was new or sudden, however; they were all old, sore, long-standing. They had begun torturing him long ago and had worn out his heart. Long, long ago this present anguish had been born in him, had grown, accumulated, and ripened recently and become concentrated, taking the form of a horrible, wild, and fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind, irresistibly demanding resolution.

“Do you understand, do you understand, my dear sir, what it means when there is no longer anywhere to go?” he suddenly recalled Marmeladov's question yesterday. “For it is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go . . .”.

“Accept fate obediently as it is, once and for all, and stifle everything in myself, renouncing any right to act, to live, to love!”.

Somehow did not participate in any of it. He was a zealous.

The attempts of critics and literary scholars to define, or simply account for, what they have found in these novels may remind one of the Hindu parable of the blind men describing an elephant, each by feeling a different part—”a snake,” “a hog weed,” “a tree,” “a broom,” “a wall.”.

In Notes from the Dead House, a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences first published in 1860, a year after his return to Petersburg, he describes how he would sit looking at a corner of blue sky and think that there, beyond the prison walls, was another life, there was freedom, and one day he would leave his prison behind and find that free life waiting for him, and he would then live nobly, gratefully, and make no more mistakes.

Something else rose up in him in the person of the underground man, this “man of heightened consciousness,” with his mocking attacks on the laws of nature and arithmetic, on sensibleness, utility, profit, on development, civilization, and reason itself.

“Two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.”.

“But here, too, I'm lying! Lying, because I myself know, like two times two, that it is not at all the underground that is better, but something different, completely different, which I thirst for but cannot ever find!”.

His response was the world as viewed by the man from underground, whose ruminations are circumscribed by the same ideas, but who has recognized that his life cannot be accounted for by them, that in fact it cannot be accounted for by any laws or with any logical consistency. Nor can it be narrated as a meaningful sequence of events, in harmonious and dignified prose.

Nor can it be narrated as a meaningful sequence of events, in harmonious and dignified prose. It is all discontinuous, full of the sudden and the unexpected, disharmonious and undignified, terrible and at the same time comical. From this basis he generalizes his attack on the world view of enlightened Europe, particularly as adopted by the Russian intelligentsia.

He took special interest in the flowers; he looked longer at them than at anything else.

In a morbid condition, dreams are often distinguished by their remarkably graphic, vivid, and extremely lifelike quality.

Gallop!” And he takes a whip in his hand, already.

She falls to the ground as if all four legs had been cut from under her.

Sticks, the shaft—and run to the dying mare.

Of course, it had happened to him dozens of times that he would return home without remembering what streets he had taken.

This woman was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply Lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that same old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, widow of a collegiate registrar,[40] the money-lender whom Raskolnikov had visited the day before to pawn his watch and make his trial...He had long known all about this Lizaveta, and she even knew him slightly.

At first—even long before—he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes.

At first—even long before—he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes are so easily detected and solved, and why almost all criminals leave such an obviously marked trail. He came gradually to various and curious conclusions, the chief reason lying, in his opinion, not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself; the criminal himself, almost any criminal, experiences at the moment of the crime a sort of failure of will and reason, which, on the contrary, are replaced by a phenomenal, childish thoughtlessness, just at the moment when reason and prudence are most.

“If I'm to perish, let me perish, I don't care!.

He was a lieutenant, the police chief's assistant, with reddish moustaches sticking out horizontally on both sides, and with extremely small features, which, incidentally, expressed nothing in particular apart from a certain insolence.

“Well, listen: I came to you because aside from you I don't know anyone who would help...to start...because you're kinder than the rest of them—smarter, that is—and you're able to talk about things...But now I see that I need nothing, do you hear, absolutely nothing...no favors, no concern from anyone...I myself...alone...And enough! Let me be, all of you!”.

While he was attending the university, he often used to stop, mostly on his way home, at precisely this spot (he had done it perhaps a hundred times), and gaze intently at the indeed splendid panorama, and to be surprised almost every time by a certain unclear and unresolved impression.

It was as if he now saw all his former past, and former thoughts, and former tasks, and former themes, and former impressions, and this whole panorama, and himself, and everything, everything, somewhere far down below, barely visible under his feet...It seemed as if he were flying upwards somewhere, and everything was vanishing from his sight.

At times it seemed to him that he had been lying there for at least a month, at other times that it was still the same day.

Now...That's just the point: an honest and sensitive man opens his heart, and the man of business listens and goes on eating—and then he eats you up.

And I'm saying it out of love now...That's just the point: an honest and sensitive man opens his heart, and the man of business listens and goes on eating—and then he eats you up.

Raskolnikov was silent and did not resist, though he felt strong enough to raise himself and sit on the sofa without any external help, strong enough not only to hold the spoon or the cup, but perhaps even to walk. But from some strange, almost animal cunning, it suddenly occurred to him to conceal his strength for the time being, to lie low, to pretend, if necessary, that he had even not quite recovered his wits, and meanwhile to listen and learn what was going on there.

“Because you know what irks me the most about it? Not that they're lying; lying can always be forgiven; lying is a fine thing, because it leads to the truth. No, what irks me is that they lie and then worship their own lies.

But facts are not everything; at least half the game is knowing how to handle the facts!”.

Well, sir, it is precisely my notion that one sees and learns most of all by observing our younger generations.

“Practicality is acquired with effort, it doesn't fall from.

“Practicality is acquired with effort, it doesn't fall from the sky for free.

But it is my personal view, if you like, that something has been done: useful new ideas have been spread, and some useful new books, instead of the former dreamy and romantic ones; literature is acquiring a shade of greater maturity; many harmful prejudices have been eradicated and derided...In short, we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past, and that in itself, I think, is already something, sir . . .”.

“What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won't overtake any one of them.

“No, it is not a commonplace, sir! If up to now, for example, I have been told to 'love my neighbor,' and I did love him, what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovich continued, perhaps with unnecessary haste. “What came of it was that I tore my caftan in two, shared it with my neighbor, and we were both left half naked, in accordance with the Russian proverb which says: If you chase several hares at once, you won't overtake any one of them.

If you love only yourself, you will set your affairs up properly, and your caftan will also remain in one piece. And economic truth adds that the more properly arranged personal affairs and, so to speak, whole caftans there are in society, the firmer its foundations are and the better arranged its common cause. It follows that by acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, I am thereby precisely acquiring for everyone, as it were, and working so that my neighbor will have something more than a torn caftan, not from private, isolated generosities now, but as a result of universal prosperity. A simple thought, which unfortunately has been too long in coming, overshadowed by rapturousness and dreaminess, though it seems it would not take much wit to realize . . .”.

I blush not only to say such things, but to hear them said in my presence.

He couldn't even rob, all he could do was kill!.

“where was it that I read about a man condemned to death saying or thinking, an hour before his death, that if he had to live somewhere high up on a cliffside, on a ledge so narrow that there was room only for his two feet—and with the abyss, the ocean, eternal darkness, eternal solitude, eternal storm all around him—and had to stay like that, on a square foot of space, an entire lifetime, a thousand years, an eternity—it would be better to live so than to die right now! Only to live, to live, to live! To live, no matter how—only to live![60].

Only to live, to live, to live! To live, no matter how—only to live![60]. . . How true! Lord, how true! Man is a scoundrel! And he's a scoundrel who calls him a scoundrel for that,” he added in a moment.

Lately she had begun talking more and more often to her older daughter, the ten-year-old Polenka, who, though she understood little as yet, still understood very well that her mother needed her, and therefore always followed her with her big, intelligent eyes, and used all her guile to pretend that she understood everything.

The tenants, one by one, squeezed back through the door, with that strange feeling of inner satisfaction which can always be observed, even in those who are near and dear, when a sudden disaster befalls their neighbor, and which is to be found in all men, without exception, however sincere their feelings of sympathy and commiseration.

He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked at her with something like happiness. It gave him such pleasure to look at her—he did not know why himself.

“And I had already consented to live on a square foot of space!.

Don't laugh, and don't be angry! ... Be angry with everyone else, but don't be angry with me!.

Lying is man's only privilege over all other organisms. If you lie—you get to the truth! Lying is what makes me a man. Not one truth has ever been reached without first lying fourteen times or so, maybe a hundred and fourteen, and that's honorable in its way; well, but we can't even lie with our own minds! Lie to me, but in your own way, and I'll kiss you for it.

Lying in one's own way is almost better than telling the truth in someone else's way; in the first case you're a man, and in the second—no better than a bird! The truth won't go away, but life can be nailed shut; there are examples. Well, so where are we all now? With regard to science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aspirations, liberalism, reason, experience, and everything, everything, everything, we're all, without exception, still sitting in the first grade! We like getting by on other people's reason—we've acquired a taste for it! Right? Am I right?”.

Wow!.

I'm unworthy of you, and drunk, and ashamed... I'm not worthy to love you, but to worship you is every man's duty, unless he's a perfect brute!.

“they may all be drunk at my place, but they're all honest, and though we do lie—because I lie, too—in the end we'll lie our way to the truth, because we're on a noble path,.

Angry...He was playing the orator here, showing off his knowledge, and then he left with his tail between his legs.

If at that moment they had ordered him to throw himself headlong down the stairs, as a service to them, he would have carried out the order at once, without argument or hesitation.

Nastasya will sit with him now, and I'll take you both to your place, because you can't go through the streets by yourselves; our Petersburg, in that respect... Well, spit on it!.

And we all realized as soon as he came in today that he was not a man of our kind. Not because he came with his hair curled by a hairdresser, not because he was in a hurry to show off his intelligence, but because he's a stool pigeon and a speculator; because he's a Jew and a mountebank, and it shows.

You think he's intelligent? No, he's a fool, a fool! So, is he a match for you? Oh, my God! You see, ladies,”.

But how becoming was her smile, how becoming her laughter—gay, young, wholehearted!.

The expression of her face was always serious and thoughtful rather than gay; but how becoming was her smile, how becoming her laughter—gay, young, wholehearted!.

“you're a nice fellow, but, on top of all your other bad qualities, you're also a philanderer, I know that, and a dirty one. You're a piece of nervous, weak-willed trash, you're whimsical, you've grown fat and can't deny yourself anything—and I call that dirty, because it leads straight to dirt. You've pampered yourself so much that, I confess, the thing I'm least able to understand is how with all that you can still be a good and even selfless physician. You sleep on a feather bed (you, a doctor!), yet you get up in the night for a sick man! In three years or so you won't be getting up for any sick man...But, the devil, that's not the point; the point is that you'll be spending the night in the landlady's apartment (it took a lot to convince her!), and I in the kitchen—so here's a chance for you to get more closely acquainted!.

What was there to be proud of in being a decent man?.

In the three years of your separation a lot of water has flowed under the bridge.

Sullen, gloomy, arrogant, proud; recently (and maybe much earlier) insecure and hypochondriac. Magnanimous and kind. Doesn't like voicing his feelings, and would rather do something cruel than speak his heart out in words. At times, however, he's not hypochondriac at all, but just inhumanly cold and callous, as if there really were two opposite characters in him, changing places with each other.

At times he's terribly taciturn! He's always in a hurry, always too busy, yet he lies there doing nothing. Not given to mockery, and not because he lacks sharpness but as if he had no time for such trifles. Never hears people out to the end. Is never interested in what interests everyone else at a given moment. Sets a terribly high value on himself and, it seems, not without a certain justification.

Crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social set-up— that alone and nothing more, no other causes are admitted—but nothing! . . .”.

With them one is always a 'victim of the environment'—and nothing else! Their favorite phrase! Hence directly that if society itself is normally set up, all crimes will at once disappear, because there will be no reason for protesting and everyone will instantly become righteous.

Nature isn't taken into account, nature is driven out, nature is not supposed to be! With them it's not mankind developing all along in a historical, living way that will finally turn by itself into a normal society, but, on the contrary, a social system, coming out of some mathematical head, will at once organize the whole of mankind and instantly make it righteous and sinless, sooner than any living process, without any historical and living way! That's why they have such an instinctive dislike of history: 'there's nothing in it but outrage and stupidity'—and everything is explained by stupidity alone! That's why they so dislike the living process of life: there's no need for the living soul! The living soul will demand life, the living soul won't listen to mechanics, the living soul is suspicious, the living soul is retrograde!.

Is there such a thing as crime, or not?.

And it turns out in the end that they've reduced everything to mere brickwork and the layout of corridors and rooms in a phalanstery![75] The phalanstery may be all ready, but your nature isn't ready for the phalanstery, it wants life, it hasn't completed the life process yet, it's too soon for the cemetery! You can't overleap nature with logic alone! Logic will presuppose three cases, when there are a million of them! Cut away the whole million, and reduce everything to the one question of comfort! The easiest solution to the problem! Enticingly clear, and there's no need to think! Above all, there's no need to think! The whole of life's mystery can fit on two printed pages!”.

I merely suggested that an 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is, not an official right, but his own right, to allow his conscience to...step over certain obstacles, and then only in the event that the fulfillment of his idea— sometimes perhaps salutary for the whole of mankind—calls for it. You have been pleased to say that my article is unclear; I am prepared to clarify it for you, as far as I can.

Kepler's or Newton's discoveries could become known to people in no other way than by sacrificing the lives of one, or ten, or a hundred or more people who were hindering the discovery, or standing as an obstacle in its path, then Newton would have the right, and it would even be his duty . . . to remove those ten or a hundred people, in order to make his discoveries known to all mankind.

Further, I recall developing in my article the idea that all... well, let's say, the lawgivers and founders of mankind, starting from the most ancient and going on to the Lycurguses, the Solons, the Muhammads, the Napoleons, and so forth,[77] that all of them to a man were criminals, from the fact alone that in giving a new law they thereby violated the old one, held sacred by society and passed down from their fathers, and they certainly did not stop at shedding blood either, if it happened that blood (sometimes quite innocent and shed valiantly for the ancient law) could help them. It is even remarkable that most of these benefactors and founders of mankind were especially terrible blood-shedders. In short, I deduce that all, not only great men, but even those who are a tiny bit off the beaten track—that is, who are a tiny bit capable of saying something new—by their very nature cannot fail to be criminals—more or less, to be sure. Otherwise it would be hard for them to get off the beaten track, and, of course, they cannot consent to stay on it, again by nature, and in my opinion it is even their duty not to consent. In short, you see that so far there is nothing especially new here.

It consists precisely in people being divided generally, according to the law of nature, into two categories: a lower or, so to speak, material category (the ordinary), serving solely for the reproduction of their own kind; and people proper—that is, those who have the gift or talent of speaking a new word in their environment. The subdivisions here are naturally endless, but the distinctive features of both categories are quite marked: people of the first, or material, category are by nature conservative, staid, live in obedience, and like being obedient. In my opinion they even must be obedient, because that is their purpose, and for them there is decidedly nothing humiliating in it. Those of the second category all transgress the law, are destroyers or inclined to destroy, depending on their abilities. The crimes of these people, naturally, are relative and variegated; for the most part they call, in quite diverse declarations, for the destruction of the present in the name of the better. But if such a one needs, for the sake of his idea, to step even over a dead body, over blood, then within himself, in his conscience, he can, in my opinion, allow himself to step over blood—depending, however, on the idea and its scale—make note of that. It is only in this sense that I speak in my article of their right to crime.

The first category is always master of the present; the second— master of the future. The first preserves the world and increases it numerically; the second moves the world and leads it towards a goal. Both the one and the other have a perfectly equal right to exist. In short, for me all men's rights are equivalent—and vive la guerre éternelle—until the New Jerusalem, of course!”[78].

It is only in this sense that I speak in my article of their right to crime. (You recall we began with the legal question.) However, there's not much cause for alarm: the masses hardly ever acknowledge this right in them; they punish them and hang them (more or less), thereby quite rightly fulfilling their conservative purpose; yet, for all that, in subsequent generations these same masses place the punished ones on a pedestal and worship them (more or less). The first category is always master of the present; the second— master of the future. The first preserves the world and increases it numerically; the second moves the world and leads it towards a goal. Both the one and the other have a perfectly equal right to exist.

“Generally, there are remarkably few people born who have a new thought, who are capable, if only slightly, of saying anything new—strangely few, in fact. One thing is clear, that the ordering of people's conception, all these categories and subdivisions, must be quite correctly and precisely determined by some law of nature. This law is as yet unknown, of course, but I believe that it exists and may one day be known. An enormous mass of people, of material, exists in the world only so that finally, through some effort, some as yet mysterious process, through some interbreeding of stocks and races, with great strain it may finally bring into the world, let's say, at least one somewhat independent man in a thousand.

Broader independence (I'm speaking approximately, graphically). With a still broader independence—one in a hundred thousand.

Perhaps one in ten thousand is born with a broader independence (I'm speaking approximately, graphically). With a still broader independence—one in a hundred thousand. Men of genius—one in millions; and great geniuses, the fulfillers of mankind—perhaps after the elapsing of many thousands of millions of people on earth.

“If I did, I would certainly not tell you,”.

Over...it wasn't a human being I killed, it was a principle! So I killed the principle, but I didn't step over, I stayed on this side...All I managed to do was kill.

Happiness'...No, life is given to me only once, and never will be again—I don't want to sit waiting for universal happiness. I want to live myself; otherwise it's better not to live at all. And so? I just didn't want to pass by my hungry mother, clutching my rouble in my pocket, while waiting for 'universal happiness.' To say, 'I'm carrying a little brick for universal happiness, and so there's a feeling of peace in my heart.'[82] Ha, ha! But why did you leave me out? I have only one life; I, too, want...Eh, an aesthetic louse is what I am, and nothing more,” he added, suddenly bursting into laughter like a madman. “Yes, I really am a louse,” he went on, gloatingly seizing upon the thought, rummaging in it, playing and amusing himself with it, “if only because, first, I'm now reasoning about being a louse; second, because I've been troubling all-good Providence for a whole month, calling it to witness that I was undertaking it not to satisfy my own flesh and lust, but with a splendid and agreeable goal in mind—ha, ha! Third, because I resolved to observe all possible justice in carrying it out, weight, measure, arithmetic: I chose the most useless louse of all and, having killed her, decided to take from her exactly as much as I needed for the first step, no more and no less (and the rest would thus simply go to the monastery, according to her will—ha, ha!)...And ultimately, ultimately I am a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “because I myself am perhaps even more vile and nasty than the louse I killed, and I had anticipated beforehand that I would tell myself so after I killed her. Can anything compare with such horror! Oh, triteness! Oh, meanness! ... Oh, how well I understand the 'prophet' with his sabre, on his steed. Allah commands—obey, 'trembling' creature![83]He's right, the 'prophet' is right when he sets up a first-rate battery across a street somewhere and blasts away at the innocent and the guilty, without even stooping to explain himself! Obey, trembling creature and—forget your wishes, because—that's none of your business! ... Oh, nothing, nothing will make me forgive the old crone!” His hair was damp with sweat, his trembling lips were parched, his fixed eyes were turned up to the ceiling. “My mother, my sister, how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate them, hate them physically, I cannot bear having them near me...I went over and kissed mother this morning, I remember...To embrace her and think that if she found out, she...should I tell her, then? That would be just like me...Hm! She must be the same as I am,” he added, making an effort to think, as though struggling against the delirium that was taking hold of him. “Oh, how I hate that little old crone now! If she recovered, I think I'd kill her again! Poor Lizaveta! Why did she have to turn up there! ... Strange, though; why is it that I almost never think of her, as if I hadn't killed her?...Lizaveta! Sonya! Poor, meek ones, with meek eyes...Dear ones! ... Why don't they weep? Why don't they moan?...They give everything...their eyes are meek and gentle...Sonya, Sonya! Gentle Sonya! . . .”.

“We keep imagining eternity as an idea that cannot be grasped, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast?

Having risen from insignificance, Pyotr Petrovich had a morbid habit of admiring himself, highly valued his intelligence and abilities, and sometimes, alone with himself, even admired his own face in the mirror. But most of all in the world he loved and valued his money, acquired by labor and various means: it made him equal to all that was higher than himself.

In deepest secret, he entertained rapturous thoughts of a well-behaved and poor girl (she must be poor), very young, very pretty, well born and educated, very intimidated, who had experienced a great many misfortunes and was utterly cowed before him, a girl who would all her life regard him as her salvation, stand in awe of him, obey him, wonder at him and at him alone.

“I was not bowing to you, I was bowing to all human suffering,”.

“and most of all you are a sinner because you destroyed yourself and betrayed yourself in vain.

“Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind...”.

Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?’”.

She went on looking at him, understanding nothing. She understood only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.

“What can be done? Smash what needs to be smashed, once and for all, and that's it—and take the suffering upon ourselves! What? You don't understand? You'll understand later...Freedom and power, but above all, power! Over all trembling creatures, over the whole ant-heap! ... That is the goal! Remember it! This is my parting word to you! I may be talking to you for the last time. If I don't come tomorrow, you'll hear about everything yourself, and then remember these present words. And sometime later, years later, as life goes on, maybe you'll understand what they meant. But if I come tomorrow, I'll tell you who killed Lizaveta. Good-bye!”.

He read everything in that one glance of hers. So she really had already thought of it herself. Perhaps many times, in despair, she had seriously considered how to end it all at once, so seriously, indeed, that now she was almost not surprised at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words (nor had she noticed, of course, the meaning of his reproaches, or his special view of her shame—that was obvious to him). But he fully understood the monstrous pain she suffered, and had long been suffering, at the thought of her dishonorable and shameful position. What, he wondered, what could so far have kept her from deciding to end it all at once? And only here did he understand fully what these poor little orphaned children meant to her, and this pitiful, half-crazed Katerina Ivanovna, with her consumption, and her beating her head against the wall.

It's necessary finally to reason seriously and directly, and not weep and cry like a child that God will not allow it!.

Us—that is, in our Russia, sir, and most of all in our Petersburg circles—if two intelligent men get together, not very well acquainted yet, but, so to speak, mutually respecting each other, just like you and me now, sir, it will take them a whole half hour to find a topic of conversation—they freeze before each other, they sit feeling mutually embarrassed.

Each of them was watching the other, but as soon as their eyes met, quick as lightning they would look away.

“it will keep, it will keep, sir, and it's all just trifles, sir!.

Human nature is a mirror, sir, the clearest mirror! Look and admire—there.

The black serpent of stung vanity had sucked all night at his heart.

Had it been possible right then to kill Raskolnikov merely by wishing, Pyotr Petrovich would immediately have voiced this wish.

He subscribed himself to progress and “our young generations” out of passion. He was one of that numerous and diverse legion of vulgarians, feeble miscreates, half-taught petty tyrants who make a point of instantly latching on to the most fashionable current idea, only to vulgarize it at once, to make an instant caricature of everything they themselves serve, sometimes quite sincerely.

Whiskers...Every human being, I hope, is allowed to defend his own person.

Environment is everything, and man himself is nothing.

The courts are not so blind...or drunk; they will not believe two notorious atheists, agitators, and freethinkers, accusing me out of personal vengeance, which they, in their foolishness, admit themselves...So, sirs, excuse me!”.

It?...And how is it, how is it that you could give away your last penny, and yet kill in order to rob!.

“You know, Sonya,” he said suddenly, with a sort of inspiration, “you know, I can tell you this much: if I'd killed them only because I was hungry,” he went on, stressing each word, and looking at her mysteriously but sincerely, “I would now be...happy! You should know that!.

“The thing is that I once asked myself this question: how would it have been if Napoleon, for example, had happened to be in my place, and didn't have Toulon, or Egypt, or the crossing of Mont Blanc to start his career, but, instead of all these beautiful and monumental things, had quite simply some ridiculous old crone, a leginstrar's widow, whom on top of that he had to kill in order to filch money from her trunk (for his career, you understand)—well, so, could he have made himself do it if there was no other way out? Wouldn't he have shrunk from it because it was so unmonumental and...and sinful? Well, I tell you, I suffered a terribly long time over this 'question,' so that I was terribly ashamed when I finally realized (somehow all at once) not only that he would not shrink, but that it wouldn't even occur to him that it was unmonumental...and he wouldn't understand at all what there was to shrink from. And if there was indeed no other path for him, he'd up and throttle her before she could make a peep, without a moment's thoughtfulness! ... So I, too...came out of my thoughtfulness...I throttled her...following the example of my authority...And that's exactly how it was! You think it's funny? Yes, Sonya, the funniest thing is that maybe that's precisely how it was . . .”.

“Then I realized, Sonya,” he went on ecstatically, “that power is given only to the one who dares to reach down and take it. Here there is one thing, one thing only: one has only to dare! And then a thought took shape in me, for the first time in my life, one that nobody had ever thought before me! Nobody! It suddenly came to me as bright as the sun: how is it that no man before now has dared or dares yet, while passing by all this absurdity, quite simply to take the whole thing by the tail and whisk it off to the devil! I... I wanted to dare, and I killed...I just wanted to dare, Sonya, that's the whole reason!”.

You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter?.

Brought something, I'd eat; if not, the day would go by; I purposely didn't ask, out of spite. At night there was no light; I used to lie in the dark, rather than earn money for candles. I was supposed to be studying, but I sold my books; and on my table, on my papers and notebooks, there's a finger-thick layer of dust even now. I liked to lie and think. And I kept on thinking...And I kept on having such dreams, all sorts of strange dreams, there's no point in telling what they were about! Only at the same time I also began imagining...No, that's not right! Again I'm not telling it right! You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter? Then I learned, Sonya, that if one waits for everyone to become smarter, it will take too long...And then I also learned that it will never happen, that people will never change, and no one can remake them, and it's not worth the effort! Yes, it's true! It's their law...A law, Sonya! It's true! ... And I know now, Sonya, that he who is firm and strong in mind and spirit will rule over them!.

You see, I kept asking myself then: am I so stupid that, if others are stupid and I know for certain they're stupid, I myself don't want to be smarter?

He who dares much will be right in their eyes. He who can spit on what is greatest will be their lawgiver, and he who dares the most will be the rightest of all! Thus it has been until now, and thus it will always be. Only a blind man can fail to see it!”.

“Don't interrupt me, Sonya! I wanted to prove only one thing to you: that the devil did drag me there then, but afterwards he explained to me that I had no right to go there, because I'm exactly the same louse as all the rest! He made a mockery of me, and so I've come to you now! Welcome your guest! If I weren't a louse, would I have come to you? Listen: when I went to the old woman that time, I went only to try...You should know that!”.

The two were sitting side by side, sad and crushed, as if they had been washed up alone on a deserted shore after a storm. He looked at Sonya and felt how much of her love was on him, and, strangely, he suddenly felt it heavy and painful to be loved like that. Yes, it was a strange and terrible feeling! On his way to see Sonya, he had felt she was his only hope and his only way out; he had thought he would be able to unload at least part of his torment; but now, suddenly, when her whole heart turned to him, he suddenly felt and realized that he was incomparably more unhappy than he had been before.

Putting it negatively, the myth of eternal return states that a life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance, and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean nothing. We need take no more note of it than of a war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century, a war that altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a hundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment.

There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.

If the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French historians would be less proud of Robespierre. But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody years of the Revolution have turned into mere words, theories, and discussions, have become lighter than feathers, frightening no one. There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.

In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.

This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted.

Not long ago, I caught myself experiencing a most incredible sensation. Leafing through a book on Hitler, I was touched by some of his portraits: they reminded me of my childhood. I grew up during the war; several members of my family perished in Hitler's concentration camps; but what were their deaths compared with the memories of a lost period in my life, a period that would never return? This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted.

It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make.

It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That is why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das schwerste Gewicht).

If every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross. It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That is why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das schwerste Gewicht).

But is heaviness truly deplorable and lightness splendid?.

But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man's body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.

Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.

If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life.

Should he call her back to Prague for good? He feared the responsibility. If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life.

What could it have been if not love declaring itself to him?.

His unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life!.

And he was distressed that in a situation where a real man would instantly have known how to act, he was vacillating and therefore depriving the most beautiful moments he had ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) of their meaning.

He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he wanted was actually quite natural.

We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?.

There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, "sketch" is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.

What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all.

He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life.

He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life. She was neither mistress nor wife. She was a child whom he had taken from a bulrush basket that had been daubed with pitch and sent to the riverbank of his bed.

He smelled the delicate aroma of her fever and breathed it in, as if trying to glut himself with the intimacy of her body.

He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.

How had he come to make such a sudden decision when for nearly a fortnight he had wavered so much that he could not even bring himself to send a postcard asking her how she was?.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor.

Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor. He tried to design his life in such a way that no woman could move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed. Even though it was wide enough, Tomas would tell his mistresses that he was unable to fall asleep with anyone next to him, and drive them home after midnight.

Again it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket and sent downstream. He couldn't very well let a basket with a child in it float down a stormy river!.

Tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous. Metaphors are not to be trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love.

Why should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single improvident night, than for any other? He would be scrupulous about paying support; he just.

Why should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single improvident night, than for any other?.

He would tell his mistresses: the only relationship that can make both partners happy is one in which sentimentality has no place and neither partner makes any claim on the life and freedom of the other.

"The important thing is to abide by the rule of threes. Either you see a woman three times in quick succession and then never again, or you maintain relations over the years but make sure that the rendezvous are at least three weeks apart.".

"The reason I like you," she would say to him, "is you're the complete opposite of kitsch. In the kingdom of kitsch you would be a monster.".

He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life.

He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life. He did not want word to get out that Tereza was sleeping at his place: spending the night together was the corpus delicti of love.

Though it was not far from the truth, he never dared tell them the whole truth: after making love he had an uncontrollable craving to be by 14   himself; waking in the middle of the night at the side of an alien body was distasteful to him, rising in the morning with an intruder repellent; he had no desire to be overheard brushing his teeth in the bathroom, nor was he enticed by the thought of an intimate breakfast.

But as he ran through the previous few hours in his mind, he began to sense an aura of hitherto unknown happiness emanating from them.

She flung it open and continued to follow him, convinced in her sleep that he meant to leave her for good and she had to stop him.

Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).

Not a day went by without her learning something about his secret life.

We need not look far for an interpretation: in Czech slang the word "cat" means a pretty woman.

In languages that derive from Latin, "compassion" means: we cannot look on coolly as others suffer; or, we sympathize with those who suffer. Another word with approximately the same meaning, "pity" (French, pitie; Italian, pieta; etc.), connotes a certain condescension towards the sufferer. "To take pity on a woman" means that we are better off than she, that we stoop to her level, lower ourselves. That is why the word "compassion" generally inspires suspicion; it designates what is considered an inferior, second-rate sentiment that has little to do with love. To love someone out of compassion means not really to love. In languages that form the word "compassion" not from the root "suffering" but from the root "feeling," the word is used in approximately the same way, but to contend that it designates a bad or inferior sentiment is difficult. The secret strength of its etymology floods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion (co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other's misfortune but also to feel with him any emotion—joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. This kind of compassion (in the sense of souc/r, wspofczucie, Mitgefuhl, medkansia) therefore signifies the maximal capacity of affective imagination, the art of emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of sentiments, then, it is supreme.

If Tereza had been any other woman, Tomas would never have spoken to her again.

He was now afraid to come home late, because Tereza would be waiting up for him.

"You seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings," she said. "The meeting of two worlds. A double exposure. Showing through the outline of Tomas the libertine, incredibly, the face of a romantic lover. Or, the other way, through a Tristan, always thinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine.".

"It is entirely possible," said Tomas, "that a female dog addressed continually by a male name will develop lesbian tendencies.".

But no carnival can go on forever.

A person who longs to leave the place where he lives is an unhappy person.

He took some sleeping pills but still did not close his eyes until morning.

The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well.

The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well. No one was forcing him into a decision. He felt no need to stare at the walls of the houses across the courtyard and ponder whether to live with her or not. Tereza had made the decision herself.

He went to a restaurant for lunch. He was depressed, but as he ate, his original desperation waned, lost its strength, and soon all that was left was melancholy. Looking back on the years he had spent with her, he came to feel that their story could have had no better ending. If someone had invented the story, this is how he would have had to end it. One day Tereza came to him uninvited. One day she left the same way. She came with a heavy suitcase. She left with a heavy suitcase. He paid the bill, left the restaurant, and started walking through the streets, his melancholy growing more and more beautiful. He had spent seven years of life with Tereza, and now he realized that those years were more attractive in retro- 30 spect than they were when he was living them. His love for Tereza was beautiful, but it was also tiring: he had constantly had to hide things from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her evidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her dreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared and only the beauty remained. Saturday found him for the first time strolling alone through Zurich, breathing in the heady smell of his freedom. New adventures hid around each corner. The future was again a secret. He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was. For seven years he had lived bound to her, his every step subject to her scrutiny. She might as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. He soared. He had entered Parmenides' magic field: he was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.

The future was again a secret.

He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was.

He was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.

He tried to remind himself. Don't think about her! Don't think about her! He said to himself, I'm sick with compassion. It's good that she's gone and that I'll never see her again, though it's not Tereza I need to be free of—it's that sickness, compassion, which I thought I was immune to until she infected me with.

For there is nothing heavier than compassion.

For there is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.

And Tomas refused to allow anyone an opportunity to think ill of her.

Unlike Parmenides, Beethoven apparently viewed weight as something positive.

The weighty resolution is at one with the voice of Fate ("Es muss sein!"); necessity, weight, and value are three concepts inextricably bound: only necessity is heavy, and only what is heavy has value.

We believe that the greatness of man stems from the fact that he bears his fate as Atlas bore the heavens on his shoulders. Beethoven's hero is a lifter of metaphysical weights.

Any schoolboy can do experiments in the physics laboratory to test various scientific hypotheses. But man, because he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to follow his passion (compassion) or not.

Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. They had been talking about his friend Z. when she announced, "If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him." Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men.

We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel that Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing the "Es muss sein!" to our own great love.

Tomas often thought of Tereza's remark about his friend Z. and came to the conclusion that the love story of his life exemplified not "Es muss sein! " (It must be so), but rather "Es konnte auch anders sein" (It could just as well be otherwise).

He had gone back to Prague because of her. So fateful a decision resting on so fortuitous a love, a love that would not even have existed had it not been for the chief surgeon's sciatica seven years earlier. And that woman, that personification of absolute fortuity, now again lay asleep beside him, breathing deeply.

The body was a cage, and inside that cage was something which looked, listened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that remainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul.

A long time ago, man would listen in amazement to the sound of regular beats in his chest, never suspecting what they were. He was unable to identify himself with so alien and unfamiliar an object as the body. The body was a cage, and inside that cage was something which looked, listened, feared, thought, and marveled; that something, that remainder left over after the body had been accounted for, was the soul.

In Tereza's eyes, books were the emblems of a secret brotherhood. For she had but a single weapon against the world of crudity surrounding her: the books she took out of the municipal library, and above all, the novels. She had read any number of them, from Fielding to Thomas Mann. They not only offered the possibility of an imaginary escape from a life she found unsatisfying; they also had a meaning for her as physical objects: she loved to walk down the street with a 47 48 book under her arm. It had the same significance for her as an elegant cane for the dandy a century ago. It differentiated her from others.

The nozzle of the hose supplying oxygen to the lungs was stuffed and red.

The difference between the university graduate and the autodidact lies not so much in the extent of knowledge as in the extent of vitality and self-confidence.

She had come to him to make her body unique, irreplaceable. But he, too, had drawn an equal sign between her and the rest of them: he kissed them all alike, stroked them alike, made no, absolutely no distinction between Tereza's body and the other bodies. He had sent her back into the world she tried to escape, sent her to march naked with the other naked women.

Our dreams prove that to imagine—to dream about things that have not happened—is among mankind's deepest needs.

Anyone whose goal is "something higher" must expect some day to suffer vertigo.

Anyone whose goal is "something higher" must expect some day to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? Then why do we feel it even when the observation tower comes 60 equipped with a sturdy handrail? No, vertigo is something other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.

"Pick me up," is the message of a person who keeps falling.

If you live only for your husband, you have no life of your own.".

In spite of their love, they had made each other's life a hell. The fact that they loved each other was merely proof that the fault lay not in themselves, in their behavior or inconstancy of feeling, but rather in their incompatibility: he was strong and she was weak. She was like Dubcek, who made a thirty-second pause in the middle of a sentence; she was like her country, which stuttered, gasped for breath, could not speak.

But when the strong were too weak to hurt the weak, the weak had to be strong enough to leave.

His mistress, who had a flexible schedule, accompanied him on all speaking engagements, real and imagined.

Franz was sad. He had grown so accustomed to linking their love life to foreign travel that his "Let's go to Palermo!" was an unambiguous erotic message and her "I prefer Geneva" could have only one meaning: his mistress no longer desired him.

Then why did he worry daily that his mistress was about to leave him?.

It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner.

The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner.

The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well.

He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defense against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow.

True, he would rather have slept by himself, but the marriage bed is still the symbol of the marriage bond, and symbols, as we know, are inviolable.

She could not take much with her when she emigrated, and taking this bulky, impractical thing meant giving UP other, more practical ones.

To rebel against being born a woman seemed as foolish to her as to take pride in it.

What we have not chosen we cannot consider either our merit or our failure.

Not every woman was worthy of being called a woman.

He was not particularly fond of Marie-Claude, but he was very much taken with her love. He felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow. He bowed so low that he married her. And even though Marie-Claude never recaptured the emotional intensity that accompanied her suicide threat, in his heart he kept its memory alive with the thought that he must never hurt her and always respect the woman in her.

The day his father left, Franz and his mother went into town together, and as they left home Franz noticed that her shoes did not match. He was in a quandary: he wanted to point out her mistake, but was afraid he would hurt her. So during the two hours they spent walking through the city together he kept his eyes fixed on her feet. It was then he had his first inkling of what it means to suffer.

He loved her from the time he was a child until the time he accompanied her to the cemetery; he loved her in his memories 91 as well. That is what made him feel that fidelity deserved pride of place among the virtues: fidelity gave a unity to lives that would otherwise splinter into thousands of split-second impressions.

Betrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher that betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. But what is betrayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. Betrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown. Sabina knew of nothing more magnificent than going off into the unknown.

But if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we have placated A.

No one can get really drunk on a novel or a painting, but who can help getting drunk on Beethoven's Ninth, Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, or the Beatles' White Album?.

"It's a vicious circle," Sabina said. "People are going deaf because music is played louder and louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still.".

She was thinking of the days of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless snow-covered plain of silence.

They were sitting together at a restaurant, and loud music with a heavy beat poured out of a nearby speaker as they ate. "It's a vicious circle," Sabina said. "People are going deaf because music is played louder and louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still." "Don't you like music?" Franz asked. "No," said Sabina, and then added, "though in a different era..." She was thinking of the days of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless snow-covered plain of silence.

She discovered that the transformation of music into noise was a planetary process by which mankind was entering the historical phase of total ugliness.

He recalled the noisy music at dinner and said to himself, "Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words." And suddenly he realized that all his life he had done nothing but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for formulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings were obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling through his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he yearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, absolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, overpowering, window-rattling din to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the futility, the vanity of words. Music was the negation of sentences, music was the anti-word! He yearned for one long embrace with Sabina, yearned never to say another sentence, another word, to let his orgasm fuse with the orgiastic thunder of music. And lulled by that blissful imaginary uproar, he fell asleep.

Seeing is limited by two borders: strong light, which blinds, and total darkness. Perhaps that was what motivated Sabina's distaste for all extremism. Extremes mean borders beyond which life ends, and a passion for extremism, in art and in politics, is a veiled longing for death.

(Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!).

That darkness was pure, perfect, thoughtless, visionless; that darkness was without end, without borders; that darkness was the infinite we each carry within us. (Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!).

A man with closed eyes is a wreck of a man.

But for her, darkness did not mean infinity; for her, it meant a disagreement with what she saw, the negation of what was seen, the refusal to see.

These reports have nothing to do with artistic talent, kicking ability, or maladies that respond well to salt sea air; they deal with one thing only: the "citizen's political profile" (in other words, what the citizen says, what he thinks, how he behaves, how he acquits himself at meetings or May Day parades). Because everything (day-to-day existence, promotion at work, vacations) depends on the outcome of the assessment process, everyone (whether he wants to play soccer for the national team, have an exhibition, or spend his holidays at the seaside) must behave in such a way as to deserve a favorable assessment.

All of them had index fingers slightly longer than their middle fingers and pointed them at whomever they happened to be talking to.

The only thing they were all able to understand was the flames, the glory of the flames when he was burned at the stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the essence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more.

Or great men? Jan Hus? None of the people in that room had ever read a line of his works.

The only things that held them together were their defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one another.

She had an overwhelming desire to tell him, like the most banal of women, Don't let me go, hold me tight, make me your plaything, your slave, be strong! But they were words she could not say. The only thing she said when he released her from his embrace was, "You don't know how happy I am to be with you." That was the most her reserved nature allowed her to express.

Franz felt his book life to be unreal. He yearned for real life, for the touch of people walking side by side with him, for their shouts. It never occurred to him that what he considered unreal (the work he did in the solitude of the office or library) was in fact his real life, whereas the parades he imagined to be reality were nothing but theater, dance, carnival—in other words, a dream.

"A philosopher once wrote that everything in my work is unverifiable speculation and called me a 'pseudo-Socrates.' I felt terribly humiliated and made a furious response. And just think, that laughable episode was the greatest conflict I've ever experienced! The pinnacle of the dramatic possibilities available to my life! We live in two different dimensions, you and I. You came into my life like Gulliver entering the land of the Lilliputians.".

"When a society is rich, its people don't need to work with their hands; they can devote themselves to activities of the spirit. We have more and more universities and more and more students. If students are going to earn degrees, they've got to come up with dissertation topics. And since dissertations can be written about everything under the sun, the number of topics is infinite. Sheets of paper covered with words pile up in archives sadder than cemeteries, because no one ever visits them, not even on All Souls' Day. Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities.".

Cemeteries in Bohemia are like gardens. The graves are covered with grass and colorful flowers. Modest tombstones are lost in the greenery. When the sun goes down, the cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a children's ball. Yes, a children's ball, because the dead are as innocent as children. No matter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, in Hitler's time, in Stalin's time, through all occupations. When she felt low, she would get into the car, leave Prague far behind, and walk through one or another of the country cemeteries she loved so well. Against a backdrop of blue hills, they were as beautiful as a lullaby.

"Really, there are books meant for daytime reading and books that can be read only at night.".

"Will you tell me why you're whistling? " Franz whispered. "Because I don't like to hear people talk about politics," she answered out loud.

But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak.

But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak. Franz's weakness is called goodness. Franz would never give Sabina orders. He would never command her, as Tomas had, to lay the mirror on the floor and walk back and forth on it naked. Not that he lacks sensuality; he simply lacks the strength to give orders. There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. Physical love is unthinkable without violence.

Enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating.

What does it mean to live in truth? Putting it negatively is easy enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating.

Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses everything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. That was why Sabina did not suffer in the least from having to keep her love secret. On the contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.

For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barriers between the private and the public.

The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to the soul.

What must be must be.

And at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly unhappy. Sabina's physical presence was much less important than he had suspected. What was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life and no one could ever remove.

Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had slipped him Hercules' broom, and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out of his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a new life—these were the gifts she had left him.

She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.

But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray?.

But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray? Sabina felt emptiness all around her. What if that emptiness was the goal of all her betrayals?.

The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.

He informed her of the deaths of Tomas and Tereza.

When graves are covered with stones, the dead can no longer get out.

The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, "Stay where you are!".

The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, "Stay where you are!" That made Sabina think about her father's grave. There was soil above his grave with flowers growing out of it and a maple tree reaching down to it, and the roots and flowers offered his corpse a path out of the grave. If her father had been covered with a stone, she would never have been able to communicate with him after he died, and hear his voice in the trees pardoning her.

Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used.

Intersect with the music of the other.

The music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other.

Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used. Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other. But it was too late now.

Yes, it was too late, and Sabina knew she would leave Paris, move on, and on again, because were she to die here they would cover her up with a stone, and in the mind of a woman for whom no place is home the thought of an end to all flight is unbearable.

He nourished the cult of Sabina more as religion than as love.

Sometimes when they were alone in his flat together, the girl would lift her eyes from a book, throw him an inquiring glance, and say, "What are you thinking about?" Sitting in his armchair, staring up at the ceiling, Franz always found some plausible response, but in fact he was thinking of Sabina.

The only thing she could not quite fathom was the curious sympathy he had for the countries occupied by the Russian empire.

People use filthy language all day long, but when they turn on the radio and hear a well-known personality, someone they respect, saying "fuck" in every sentence, they feel somehow let down.

A concentration camp is a world in which people live crammed together constantly, night and day. Brutality and violence are merely secondary (and not in the least indispensable) characteristics. A concentration camp is the complete obliteration of privacy.

And if various parts of her body began to grow and shrink and Tereza no longer looked like herself, would she still be herself, would she still be Tereza?.

The only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate.

The only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers. A question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breached. In other words, it is questions with no answers that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human existence.).

What is flirtation? One might say that it is behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, while preventing that possibility from becoming a certainty. In other words, flirting is a promise of sexual intercourse without a guarantee.

Tomas kept trying to convince her that love and lovemaking were two different things. She refused to understand.

She knew that she had become a burden to him: she took things too seriously, turning everything into a tragedy, and failed to grasp the lightness and amusing insignificance of physical love. How she wished she could learn lightness!.

Toilets in modern water closets rise up from the floor like white water lilies. The architect does all he can to make the body forget how paltry it is, and to make man ignore what happens to his intestinal wastes after the water from the tank flushes them down the drain. Even though the sewer pipelines reach far into our houses with their tentacles, they are carefully hidden from view, and we are happily ignorant of the invisible Venice of shit underlying our bathrooms, bedrooms, dance halls, and parliaments.

People usually escape from their troubles into the future; they draw an imaginary line across the path of time, a line beyond which their current troubles will cease to exist.

She, on the other hand, awoke with great reluctance with a desire to stave off the day by keeping her eyes closed.

It lacked the power to become the only body in Tomas's life.

"I can't take it anymore, Tomas. I know I shouldn't complain. Ever since you came back to Prague for me, I've forbidden myself to be jealous. I don't want to be jealous. I suppose I'm just not strong enough to stand up to it. Help me, please!".

Tereza knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul; the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice.

"They need to trap people," the ambassador went on, "to force them to collaborate and set other traps for other people, so that gradually they can turn the whole nation into a single organization of informers.".

The criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise.

The criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.

Anyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the work of criminals is overlooking a basic truth: the criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.

The main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?.

The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one.

A man who chooses to be a politician, say, voluntarily makes the public his judge, with the naive assurance that he will gain its favor.

How defenseless we are in the face of flattery!.

When you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you have a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere.

It is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police.

It is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police. We do not know how to lie.

Insofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-seated desires that orient them to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is different. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of beyond. An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the rest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to do with talent, which goes deeper than talent, no one can become an actor. Similarly, a doctor is someone who consents to spend his life involved with human bodies and all that they entail. That basic consent (and not talent or skill) enables him to enter the dissecting room during the first year of medical school and persevere for the requisite number of years.

Certain Dembscher owed Beethoven fifty florins, and when the composer, who was chronically short of funds, reminded him of the debt, Dembscher heaved a mournful sigh and said, "Muss es sein?" To which Beethoven replied, with a hearty laugh, "Es muss sein!" and immediately jotted down these words and their melody. On this realistic motif he then composed a canon for four voices: three voices sing "Es muss sein, es muss sein, ja, ja, ja, ja!" (It must be, it must be, yes, yes, yes, yes!), and the fourth voice chimes in with "Heraus mit dem Beutel!" (Out with the purse!).

"Well, two hundred, give or take a few.".

Each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it is an originality that demonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of value to come of.

The brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful.

He was in the situation of a chess player who cannot avoid checkmate and is forced to resign. Whether he signed the petition or not made not the slightest difference. It would alter nothing in his own life or in the lives of the political prisoners.

"Some ideas have the force of a bomb exploding.".

The Communists have the excuse that Stalin misled them. Murderers have the excuse that their mothers didn't love them. And suddenly you come out and say: there is no excuse. No one could be more innocent, in his soul and conscience, than Oedipus. And yet he punished himself when he saw what he had done.".

This is the image from which he was born. As I have pointed out before, characters are not born like people, of woman; they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor containing in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has discovered or said something essential about. But isn't it true that an author can write only about himself? Staring impotently across a courtyard, at a loss for what to do; hearing the pertinacious rumbling of one's own stomach during a moment of love; betraying, yet lacking the will to abandon the glamorous path of betrayal; raising one's fist with the crowds in the Grand March; displaying one's wit before hidden microphones—I have known all these situations, I have experienced them myself, yet none of them has given rise to the person my curriculum vitae and I represent. The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It is that crossed border (the border beyond which my own "I" ends) which attracts me most. For beyond that border begins the secret the novel asks about. The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the trap the world has become. But enough.

Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision; we are not granted a second, third, or fourth life in which to compare various decisions.

What happens but once might as well not have happened at all.

History is as light as individual human life, unbearably light, light as a feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow.

Somewhere out in space there was a planet where all people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on earth and of all the experience they had amassed here.

Somewhere out in space there was a planet where all people would be born again. They would be fully aware of the life they had spent on earth and of all the experience they had amassed here. And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives.

And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives. And perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one degree (one life) more mature.

And perhaps there was still another planet, where we would all be born a third time with the experience of our first two lives. And perhaps there were yet more and more planets, where mankind would be born one degree (one life) more mature. That was Tomas's version of eternal return.

The Minister of Culture, from whom the poet did everything possible to hide, did not catch up with Hrubin until his funeral, when he made a speech over the grave about the poet's love for the Soviet Union. Perhaps he hoped his words would ring so outrageously false that they would wake Hrubin from the dead. But the world was too ugly, and no one decided to rise up out of the grave.

If excitement is a mechanism our Creator uses for His own amusement, love is something that belongs to us alone and enables us to flee the Creator. Love is our freedom. Love lies beyond "Es muss sein!".

Attaching love to sex is one of the most bizarre ideas the Creator ever had.

People were hermaphrodites until God split them in two, 239 and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost.

"What are you looking at?" she asked. 240 He knew that instead of waking her he should lull her back to sleep, so he tried to come up with an answer that would plant the image of a new dream in her mind. "I'm looking at the stars," he said. "Don't say you're looking at the stars. That's a lie. You're looking down." "That's because we're in an airplane. The stars are below us." "Oh, in an airplane," said Tereza, squeezing his hand even tighter and falling asleep again. And Tomas knew that Tereza was looking out of the round window of an airplane flying high above the stars.

Stalin's son had a hard time of it. All evidence points to the conclusion that his father killed the woman by whom he had the boy. Young Stalin was therefore both the Son of God (because his father was revered like God) and His cast-off. People feared him twofold: he could injure them by both his wrath (he was, after all, Stalin's son) and his favor (his father might punish his cast-off son's friends in order to punish him). Rejection and privilege, happiness and woe—no one felt more concretely than Yakov how interchangeable opposites are, how short the step from one pole of human existence to the other.

When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall.

Can proximity cause vertigo? It can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall.

Can proximity cause vertigo? It can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall. If rejection and privilege are one and the same, if there is no difference between the sublime and the paltry, if the Son of God can undergo judgment for shit, then human existence loses its dimensions and becomes unbearably light.

The Germans who sacrificed their lives to expand their country's territory to the east, the Russians who died to extend their country's power to the west—yes, they died for something idiotic, and their deaths have no meaning or general validity.

Valentinus resolved the damnable dilemma by claiming that Jesus "ate and drank, but did not defecate.".

Shit is a more onerous theological problem than is evil. Since God gave man freedom, we can, if need be, accept the idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes. The responsibility for shit, however, rests entirely with Him, the Creator of man.

There was pleasure in Paradise, but no excitement.

As long as man was allowed to remain in Paradise, either (like Valentinus' Jesus) he did not defecate at all, or (as would seem more likely) he did not look upon shit as something repellent.

Man began to hide what shamed him, and by the time he removed the veil, he was blinded by a great light. Thus, immediately after his introduction to disgust, he was introduced to excitement. Without shit (in both the literal and figurative senses of the word), there would be no sexual love as we know it, accompanied by pounding heart and blinded senses.

The dispute between those who believe that the world was created by God and those who think it came into being of its own accord deals with phenomena that go beyond our reason and experience. Much more real is the line separating those who doubt being as it is granted to man (no matter how or by whom) from those who accept it without reservation.

The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation.

The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation. Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in which case don't lock yourself in the bathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner.

Kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word;.

"Kitsch" is a German word born in the middle of the sentimental nineteenth century, and from German it entered all Western languages. Repeated use, however, has obliterated its original metaphysical meaning: kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence.

The model of Communist kitsch is the ceremony called May Day.

Kitsch may not, therefore, depend on an unusual situation; it must derive from the basic images people have engraved in their memories: the ungrateful daughter, the neglected father, children running on the grass, the motherland betrayed, first love.

Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children running on the grass! The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass! It is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch.

Soviet society had made such progress that the basic conflict was no longer between good and evil but between good and better.

The greatest conflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers' misunderstanding: he thought she no longer loved him; she thought he no longer loved her. But in the final scene they would fall into each other's arms, tears of happiness trickling down their cheeks.

All her life she had proclaimed kitsch her enemy. But hadn't she in fact been carrying it with her?.

Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right. Yet to define one or the other by means of the theoretical principles it professes is all but impossible. And no wonder:.

Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right.

"Would you be terribly upset if I went on the march?" he asked the girl with the glasses, who counted every day away from him a loss, yet could not deny him a thing.

How can it be that leftist intellectuals (because the doctor with the mustache was nothing if not a leftist intellectual) are willing to march against the interests of a Communist country when Communism has always been considered the left's domain?.

When the crimes of the country called the Soviet Union became too scandalous, a leftist had two choices: either to spit on his former life and stop marching or (more or less sheepishly) to reclassify the Soviet Union as an obstacle to the Grand March and march on.

Then there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation of people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the room will go dark. Tereza and Tomas belong in the third category.

We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under. The first category longs.

We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under.

The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, in other words, for the look of the public.

He had the feeling that the atmosphere was suddenly a hundred times thinner. Nothing could replace the look of unknown eyes. He thought he would suffocate. Then one day he realized that he was constantly being followed, bugged, and surreptitiously photographed in the street. Suddenly he had anonymous eyes on him and he could breathe 270 again! He began making theatrical speeches to the microphones in his wall. In the police, he had found his lost public.

The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. They are happier than the people in the first category, who, when they lose their public, have the feeling that the lights have gone out in the room of their lives. This happens to nearly all of them sooner or later. People in the second category, on the other hand, can always come up with the eyes they need.

And finally there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers. Franz, for example. He traveled to the borders of Cambodia only for Sabina. As the bus bumped along the Thai road, he could feel her eyes fixed on him in a long stare.

"Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric.".

"Forgive them, for they know not what they do.".

The words that made the biggest impression on him were "Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric." When his girlfriend's uncle put a Bible in his hands, he was particularly struck by Jesus' words "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." He knew that his father was a nonbeliever, but in the similarity of the two phrases he saw a secret sign: his father agreed with the path he had taken.

Tereza and Tomas had died under the sign of weight. She wanted to die under the sign of lightness.

He had come to find out once and for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl with the glasses was his real life, his only real life! He had come to find out that reality was more than a dream, much more than a dream!.

When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object.

(because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself);.

It follows, then, that the true opponent of totalitarian kitsch is the person who asks questions. A question is like a knife that slices through the stage backdrop and gives us a look at what lies hidden behind it.

Fully to the mistress she herself had sent to him?.

Sabina who had made him feel so small.

In death, Franz at last belonged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never belonged to her before.

In death, Franz at last belonged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never belonged to her before. Marie-Claude took care of everything: she saw to the funeral, sent out the announcements, bought the wreaths, and had a black dress made—a wedding dress, in reality. Yes, a husband's funeral is a wife's true wedding! The climax of her life's work! The reward for her sufferings!.

Tomas had longed for a world in which justice would reign.

Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and decent man. How else can you explain that crazy, desperate trip to wherever it was in Asia?.

Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and decent man. How else can you explain that crazy, desperate trip to wherever it was in Asia? He went there to find death.

And so on and so forth. Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is the stopover between being and oblivion.

What remains of Franz? An inscription reading A RETURN AFTER LONG WANDERINGS.

What remains of Tomas? An inscription reading HE WANTED THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH.

Life in the country was the only escape open to them, because only in the country was there a constant deficit of people and a surplus of living accommodations.

Farmer who no longer owns his own land and is merely a laborer tilling the soil forms no allegiance to either region or work; he has nothing to lose, nothing to fear for. As a result of such apathy, the countryside had maintained more than a modicum of autonomy and freedom.

Who can tell what distances he covered on his way back? Who knows what phantoms he battled?.

The very beginning of Genesis tells us that God created man in order to give him dominion over fish and fowl and all creatures.

But the major drive was directed against dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but radio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets and parks, endanger our children's health,.

But the major drive was directed against dogs. People were still disconsolate over the catastrophe of the occupation, but radio, television, and the press went on and on about dogs: how they soil our streets and parks, endanger our children's health, fulfill no useful function, yet must be fed.

We can never establish with certainty what part of our relations with others is the result of our emotions—love, antipathy, charity, or malice—and what part is predetermined by the constant power play among individuals.

She did not wish to claim that they could love each other more. Her feeling was rather that, given the nature of the human couple, the love of man and woman is a priori inferior to that which can exist (at least in the best instances) in the love between man and dog, that oddity of human history probably unplanned by the Creator.

It is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company.

Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.

His look of awful trust did not last long; he soon laid his head back down on his paws. Tereza knew that no one ever again would look at her like that.

(Oh, how horrible that we actually dream ahead to the death of those we love!).

Whenever a camera is in the offing, they immediately run to the nearest child, lift it in the air, kiss it on the cheek. Kitsch is the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements.

When I say "totalitarian," what I mean is that everything 252 that infringes on kitsch must be banished for life: every display of individualism (because a deviation from the collective is a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (because in the realm of kitsch everything must be taken quite seriously); and the mother who abandons her family or the man who prefers men to women, thereby calling into question the holy decree "Be fruitful and multiply.".

True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.


# Silman's Complete Endgame Course: From Beginner to Master (Silman, Jeremy)

“Amazingly enough, I have not yet found a single endgame manual which I could recommend wholeheartedly to my pupils. Most existing books are either elementary and useful for novices only, or are useless methodologically, or do not cover endgame theory fully.”.

Jumping from book to book is a fast track to nowhere.

After mastering the material there, put the book away and spend your time studying tactics and a few strategic concepts.

For example, I heretically decided not to include Bishop and Knight vs. Lone King because it’s far from easy to master, and it occurs very rarely in over-the-board play.

Think about it: an hour of work for a lifetime of endgame confidence.

“nobody ever won a game by resigning.”.

Beginners only need to be aware of two endgame situations: Overkill Mates (one side has an enormous amount of material versus the lone enemy King) and Stalemates (one side has no legal moves, but is not in check).

When you are up by a Queen and a Rook, or even by two Queens (or more!), one must wonder if your opponent (who could give up and show a bit of respect) is bullheaded or simply enjoys suffering and/or pain. Whatever his reasons for continuing might be, you are the one who must now demonstrate how easy it is to score the victory.

Trust me, nobody cares if you mate in three or five, as long as you succeed every time!).

As in almost all mating endgames, you need to push the enemy King to one of the four sides of the board. The point of the Staircase is to use one major piece (Rook or Queen) to keep the enemy King from stepping onto a rank or file. Then the other major piece will give check along the next rank or file, forcing the target King to step closer to its doom on the side of the board.

However, if you’ve become addicted to endgame study and wish to continue your “technical” education, the following books should prove both useful and enjoyable.

This didn’t seem to affect me too much because I lost the vast majority of my games rather quickly and rarely had need of any endgame skills at all.

Here in Part Two, you’ll learn what material advantages do and don’t win, and you’ll take your first step into the world of serious endgame knowledge—you’ll develop an appreciation for the powers of the King, the mysteries of the Opposition, and the drawing proclivities of the rook-pawns.

Two Bishops = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight (5) might never occur in your whole chess lifetime and is far too difficult to waste your precious study time on (in other words, this book won’t examine Bishop and Knight vs. King at all).

White only has a chance to deliver mate in this endgame if black’s King blunders into a mate in one.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame. The truth is, the King is a very strong piece (at least as strong as a Bishop or Knight)! Unfortunately, the terror created by the game’s early phases causes most players to lose sight of this piece’s true worth.

In such a situation it is a disadvantage to have the move since you must give up control of one of the blockade squares (shown by the three Xs in the diagram) and thus allow the opponent a way into your position.

When your King has to step away from the pawn, always go straight back!.

Yet, the game is a dead draw if Black stops the white King from penetrating to the front of its pawn.

King and rook-pawn vs. lone King: If the defender’s King gets in front of the pawn, the game will always be a draw!.

Whoever moves with an odd number of squares between the Kings does not have the Opposition (it’s the same in basic Opposition situations: one/odd square separates the Kings and the person to move doesn’t have the Opposition). Conversely, the person to move with an even number of squares between the Kings does have the Opposition.

In such Opposition battles, you want to have an odd number of squares between the Kings with the other guy to move!.

In this type of situation, the rule is to make a square or a rectangle in which each corner is the same color with the other guy to move.

It can be seen that it is not difficult to determine who has the Opposition when the Kings “connect” on a rank, file, or diagonal. But what if they fail to connect altogether?.

Unless the defending King is on vacation elsewhere on the board, the presence of a rook-pawn will make the game a draw.

If you’re trying to win and you can enter a pawn up endgame where you have a rook-pawn, be careful! The words “rook-pawn” and “draw” seem to be bound at the hip!.

Of course, 4...Kf8?? 5.h7, 1-0, would leave us wondering about the state of black’s mental health.

If the defender has it, then the game is a draw. If the stronger side has the Opposition, then the game is won.

When the stronger side gets his King (on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th rank) directly in front of his pawn, the only question that matters is, “Who owns the Opposition?”.

Move as far forward with your King as possible, while always making sure that your pawn is safe!.

Fox in the Chicken Coup refers to a situation where the stronger side’s King (the “fox”) rushes to the other side of the board to feast on helpless enemy pawns (“chickens”) while the defending King is busy dealing with a pawn on the other wing.

“When your King is in front of your pawn, go as far forward as possible until the pawn is in danger.”.

As you can see, a player must always be on the alert for such “freezing” moves!.

In such situations, players sometimes refer to pawns of this nature as “baby Queens” since they have one purpose in life: to reach the end of the board and become an adult!.

If the Knight can take control of any square in front of the pawn, the game is drawn.

A lone Knight can only triumph over a lone pawn if that pawn is a rook-pawn and if its King is trapped in front of it. Why? Because, in certain rare instances, the rook-pawn allows smother mates to occur.

If the enemy pawn is well into its journey towards promotion, and if its King is helping, and if the Rook’s King is off on vacation, then a draw will result.

A pawn on the 5th rank and a King trapped on the 3rd rank by the enemy Rook is always a win for the side with the Rook.

As in all endgames, stalemates play an important part in the defender’s hopes and must always remain in the stronger side’s mind as something to avoid at all costs.

If this doesn’t make any sense, run, don’t walk, to Part Three and read the section on Indirect Opposition again.

If taking the Opposition fails to accomplish the goal of getting the King in front of its pawn, then it’s useless to take the Opposition in the first place.

This rule—if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition, illustrated in Part Three, Diagram 62—only flounders if the pawn is a rook-pawn, or if the pawn is on the 5th rank and its King is on the 6th.

Our oft-repeated rule (i.e., if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition), shockingly, turns out to have two exceptions!.

By now you should know when a basic King and pawn vs. lone King position is lost or drawn.

This kind of position, which can occur with any set of pawns other than rook-pawns (with both Kings in front of their respective pawns), is known as a Trébuchet.

There is not much to learn, since a glance will make things pretty clear: whoever moves is in zugzwang—he is forced to move away from the defense of his pawn, which will result in an obviously lost King and pawn vs. lone King situation. Thus, if White has the move:.

The idea of something definable which can help us understand the right path in seemingly tough positions is an important one, and we’ll be searching for such “crutches” all through this book.

Since black’s King will be closer to the two center pawns (meaning that he can make first contact), White will end up a loser in the coming battle.

In a near (upcoming) Trébuchet position, the side whose King can make first diagonal contact with the enemy pawn can force a winning Trébuchet.

You can often solve seemingly difficult situations by steering the game towards the many basic situations you have mastered.

The ability to see whether or not you or your opponent can gain the Opposition in key moments is extremely important. Successful endgame play is impossible without this skill.

He’s not able to use the “move the King straight back” rule since he’s run out of board!.

In diagram 99, Black’s King was not able to step backwards after the pawn reached e6 and, as a result, he lost.

There is a bit of an optical illusion in diagram 99, so carefully compare the last two positions until the “why” and “how” becomes clear.

If the pawns are healthy and not rook-pawns, King and two pawns vs. a lone King always wins.

King and two (doubled) pawns vs. lone King always win unless the pawns can’t be properly defended, or unless they are rook-pawns.

“Excuse me, but could you kindly move your King away from the front of my pawn?”.

When you possess King and two doubled pawns vs. lone King, don’t push both pawns up the board together since that increases the weaker side’s chances for a lucky stalemate.

If the defender’s King stands on any of the “X” squares the game will be a draw (the position of white’s King won’t change the result).

Can black’s King stop (or even win) the enemy pawn? The game hangs in the balance—if the black King can stop the pawn, then the game is drawn, while the game is lost if the King can’t. The answer lies in a technique called the Square of the Pawn.

After a bit of time the whole Square of the Pawn idea will be an easy and natural part of your chess arsenal.

What is an Outside Passed Pawn? It’s a passed pawn that stands to the side of the main sphere of battle. Such a pawn is usually a very valuable commodity since it can be far from the enemy King and thus pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender.

A Bishop and (safe) non rook-pawn vs. lone King is always a win (finally something makes sense!).

Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn.

Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.

Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth.

Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.


# How to Day Trade for a Living: Tools, Tactics, Money Management, Discipline and Trading Psychology (Aziz, Andrew)

Success in trading is not a revolution, it is an evolution.

In my opinion, the most important lesson that you can learn from reading this book is that you will not get rich quickly by day trading. Day trading is not similar to gambling or playing the lottery. This is the most important misconception that people have about day trading and I hope you will come to the same conclusion after reading this book.

The release of the records of financial brokers. Those records indicated that after six months of trading, only 16% of day traders actually made money.

Those records indicated that after six months of trading, only 16% of day traders actually made money.

Trading in a simulator account is expediting your learning curve exponentially.

And, once you begin trading with your real money, you need to treat it as your job, as your career, and as your profession. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You need to enter each trade with a well-thought-out plan and then stick to it. As I am fond of saying, you need to stick to your trading plans like glue! You cannot allow your emotions to get the better of you in the midst of a trade.

An average successful day trader can make between $500 and $1,000 every day.

I will explain specific reasons behind this important question in Chapters 8 and 9 but, overall, in my opinion, the most common reason that people fail in day trading is that they do not regard it as a serious business.

Others decide to become involved in trading because they think it will be fun or entertaining, or an interesting hobby of some kind. They might be attracted to trading because they consider it a “cool” thing to do, something that will bring them prestige or perhaps make them more attractive to others.

I always advise individuals to budget at least $1,500 for education for their first year. Yes, $1,500 might be a lot of money for one week or one month of training, but over the course of your lifetime, it is a very manageable investment, even for people who are not financially blessed but are ready to begin trading.

It always amazes me when I see people start a new business without proper education and training.

Seek a solid education and practice for at least three months in simulators before trading with real money.

In reality, trading isn't about “always” at all; it is about each situation that presents itself and it is about each individual trade.

When traders are undercapitalized but still hope to trade for a living, they are more likely to take higher risks to achieve their desired returns. That, unfortunately, will most likely destroy their account.

First, you’re looking for stocks that are moving in a relatively predictable manner. Secondly, you are going to trade them in one day. You will not keep any position overnight. If you buy stock in Apple (ticker: AAPL) today, for instance, you will not hold your position overnight and sell it tomorrow. If you hold onto any stock overnight, it is no longer day trading, it’s called swing trading.

Swing trading is a form of trading in which you hold stocks over a period of time, generally from one day to a few weeks. It is a completely different style of trading, and you shouldn’t use the strategies and tools that you use for day trading to do swing trading. Do you remember Rule 2, where I mentioned that day trading is a business? Swing trading is also a business, but a completely different kind of business.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading. We are aware that we are running two different businesses, and we have gone through separate educational programs for these two kinds of trading.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight. For day trading, however, you can trade anything, including companies that will soon go bankrupt, because you don’t care what happens after the market closes. In fact, many of the companies that you will day trade are too risky to hold overnight because they might lose much of their value in that short of a period of time.

Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans. You should never change a day trade that was supposed to close at the end of the day into a swing trade. It’s a common human inclination to accept profits quickly and to also want to wait until losing trades return to even.

When I sit down with them and listen to their expectations, I realize that most of them want to invest their money, they are not looking for a new or additional career as a trader.

How I can make money today is my obsession and my expertise.

Day traders buy stocks in the hope that their price will go higher. This is called buying long , or simply long.

“I am long 100 shares AAPL,” it means that we have bought 100 shares of Apple Inc. and would like to sell them higher for a profit.

Day traders can borrow shares from their broker and sell them, hoping that the price will go lower and that they can then buy those shares back at a lower price and make a profit.

Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up.

Short sellers profit when the price of the stock they borrowed and sold drops. Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up. Fear is a more powerful feeling than greed. Therefore, short sellers, if they trade right, can make astonishing profits while other traders panic and start to sell off.

However, like anything in the market that has great potential, short selling has its risks too. When buying stocks of a company for $5, the worst case scenario is that the company goes bankrupt and you lose your $5 per share. There is a limit to your loss. But if you short sell that company at $5 and then the price, instead of going down, starts going higher and higher, then there won’t be any limit to your loss. The price may go to $10, $20, or $100, and still there will be no limit to your loss. Your broker wants those shares back. Not only can you lose all of the money in your account, but your broker can also sue you for more money if you do not have sufficient funds to cover your shorts.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher. Short sellers are balancing the market and adjusting prices to their reasonable value. Their actions are conducive to the health of the market.

Strategy. Having said that, I am more careful.

Notwithstanding that fact, individual traders have a tremendous advantage over institutional traders. Banks and other institutions are compelled to trade, often in large volumes, and sometimes with little regard to price. They are expected to be constantly active in the market. Individual traders, on the other hand, can decide whether or not they want to trade, and they can bide their time until opportunities present themselves.

One hundred shares is low-risk, and although it’s also a low reward for the trader, you need to start somewhere. New traders should start out with trading 100 shares. If their stop loss hits, they really have no excuse about why they couldn’t get out. Even for an illiquid stock (a stock that is hard to sell) that is traded with very low volume, 100 shares is nothing.

Therefore, you need to find stocks that will make quick moves to the upside or to the downside in a relatively predictable manner.

You will not trade stocks that other retail traders are not trading or not seeing.

The more traders using these strategies, the better they will work. As more people recognize the line in the sand, more people will be buying at that point.

This is why many traders are happy to share their day trading strategies.

I believe one of the most significant challenges with these “black boxes” is that the computer programmers who work so many hours each day on the formulas don’t have a clue how to day trade themselves.

Never forget that in the equally strategic world of chess, Garry Kasparov did win some of his rounds against IBM’s Deep Blue.

Of the various HFT programs that are currently operating, one of the least effective is the so-called “ Buy the New Low” program. When a stock reaches a new intraday low, many day traders will go short to ride the downside momentum. This program then begins to buy the shorts from those day traders to push the price higher. This causes day traders to panic and to cover their shorts. Because the organizations behind HFT programs have almost limitless buying power, the plan sounds flawless. The plan quickly breaks down, however, when another large institutional seller is behind the trade and decides to dump their large positions. This means that regardless of how many shares the program buys, the stock will simply not push higher because institutional sellers and day traders will continue to dump their shares on it.

What works today for traders may not work tomorrow.

For example, when a program forces short sellers to cover fast, ride the short squeeze on the up side with the program.

The market is simply a pattern-solving exercise.

But what we should not do, what a trader must never do, is to make excuses.

As part of the algorithmic trading by computer systems, the majority of the stocks will trend with the overall market unless they have a reason not to.

But, remember, there will be a handful of stocks that will buck the trend of the market because they have a catalyst. These are the Stocks in Play . This is what retail traders are looking for - that small handful of stocks that are going to be running when the markets are tanking, or tanking when the markets are running.

If the market is running, and these stocks are running too, that's fine. You just want to ensure you are trading stocks that are moving because they have a fundamental reason to move and are not just moving with the overall market conditions: Stocks in Play.

When I do reversal trades (Chapter 7), my favorite reversal trades are on stocks that are selling off because there has been some bad news regarding that company.

If there is a quick sell off because of bad news, many people will notice and start monitoring the stock for what is called a Bottom Reversal.

If stocks are trending down with the overall market, such as oil was some time ago, you cannot do a good reversal trade.

Their value pops up by 10 cents, and you think it’s a reversal, but then they are sold off for another 50 cents. They’re selling off because they’re trending with both the overall market and their sector. Oil was a weak sector for a while in 2014 and 2015 and the majority of the oil and energy stocks were selling off. When a sector is weak, that is not a good time to make a reversal trade. That’s where you have to differentiate.

Rule 4: Always ask, “ Is this stock moving because the overall market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst ?”.

That’s when you have to do a little bit of research. As you become more experienced as a trader, you will be able to differentiate between catalyst-based price action and general market trending.

As discussed, as a retail trader, you must be careful that you are not on the wrong side of the trade against institutional traders.

You’re in the wrong place. Focus where everyone else is focused: focus on the stock that is moving every single day and receiving literally a ton of action. That is what day traders will be looking at.

Can you day trade stocks like Apple or Priceline or Coca-Cola or IBM? Of course you can, but these are slow moving stocks that are dominated by institutional traders and algorithmic traders, and in general terms they are going to be very hard to day trade.

As I mentioned earlier, I’m not a value investor and I’m not a long-term investor. I don’t trade Options or Futures either, but I do use Futures to gain an understanding of the overall market direction in the near-term future. I am an intraday equity (stock) trader. I am also a swing trader. In swing trading, I personally do care very much about the fundamentals of the companies I choose to trade: their earnings, dividends, earnings-per-share, and many other criteria. But swing trading is not the focus of this book, so I won’t pursue that topic for now.

I’m also a Forex (foreign exchange market) trader and sometimes I trade commodities and currencies. But, in the mornings, I am mostly an equities day trader and I focus on the real stocks. The majority of day traders don’t trade penny stocks or on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Penny stocks are extremely manipulated and they do not follow any of the rules of the standard strategies. We trade real stocks. Sometimes we may be trading Facebook (ticker: FB) and sometimes we may be trading Apple (ticker: AAPL), but we will always be trading the stocks that are having a big day. You may be surprised, but on almost every single day in the market, there's a stock having a big day because the company has released earnings, had a newsbreak, or had something bad or good happen to it. These are the fundamental catalysts that you must look for.

You will read about it in detail in Chapter 8, but my trading day typically starts at around 6 a.m. (which is 9 a.m. New York time) with pre-market scanning. I’m scanning to see where there is volume in the market. As early as 8:30 a.m. New York time, you’ll know what stocks are gapping up or gapping down. I then start scouring through the news for catalysts that explain the gaps. I start to put together a watchlist (the list of stocks I will monitor during the trading day). I rule some out and then I pick and choose which ones I do and don’t like. By 9:15 a.m. New York time I am in our chatroom, going over my watchlist with all of our traders. By 9:30 a.m., when the bell rings, my plans are ready.

The advantage of having all of that volume is that it provides liquidity. This means there are plenty of buyers and plenty of sellers, which in turn means that you can easily get in and out of trades.

I personally trade only within the first one or two hours of the market’s opening.

I avoid pre-market trading because there is very low liquidity as there are very few traders trading. That means stocks can pop up a dollar, then drop a dollar, and you can’t get in and out with large shares. You have to go really small, and you have to use such small positions that, for me at least, it's just not worth it. If you don't mind trading in small shares, then you can certainly trade pre-market, but you need to first ensure your broker will allow you to do pre-market trading.

The great advantage for me is that I can be finished trading before many of the people in my city are even out of bed.

You know how easy it is to lose money. Once you have some money in your pocket, you should hold on to it.

I’ve learned, and at times the hard way, that success in day trading comes from initially mastering one proven trading strategy, such as what I have devoted Chapter 7 of this book to; knowing how much to properly enter a trade with and knowing when to properly exit a trade, all without risking any more of your hard-earned money than necessary; and, as has been emphasized several times already in this book, controlling your emotions.

Often, beginner traders who fail to make money in the markets get frustrated and go out and try to learn more about how the markets work, study new strategies, adopt additional technical indicators, follow some different traders, and join other chatrooms.

They don’t realize that the main cause of their failure is often a lack of self-discipline, the making of impulsive decisions and sloppy risk and money management, not their technical knowledge.

You are the only problem you will ever have for your trading career and, of course, you are the only solution to this problem.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you. Something completely unexpected can happen in the middle of your trade. Please believe me, there is no magic formula for success.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”. This simple saying says so much about the mindset of a professional trader. If you survive the learning curve, then the good times will come and you can become a consistently profitable trader. But you have to survive. And many just can’t.

A common reason for the failure of new day traders is that they cannot manage their early losses. Accepting profits is easy to do, but it is much more difficult, especially for beginners, to overcome the temptation to wait for losing trades to return to the break-even point. “I just give this trade a bit more room” often they say. Waiting for something that is not likely to happen can result in serious damage to their accounts.

To be a successful trader, not only you must learn excellent risk management rules but also you need to firmly implement them.

You must have a line in the sand that tells you when to get out of a trade.

It’s going to be necessary from time to time to admit defeat and say, “I was wrong,” or “The setup isn’t ready yet,” or “I'm getting out of the way.” And that acknowledgement must come in a timely fashion. Waiting too long to exit a trade can literally wipe out your entire account.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but I still lose frequently. That means I must have found a way to be a really good loser. Lose gracefully. Take the losses and walk away.

If a trade goes against you, exit the trade. In day trading, the unexpected will occur, this is the name of the game. There is always another trade and another day. Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting. I.

Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting.

I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to be a good loser. You have to be able to accept a loss. It’s an integral part of day trading.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.”.

You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.” You do not want to do that. You must follow the rules of your strategy. You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss. You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss.

Every time you trade, you’re exposing yourself to the risk of losing money. How do you minimize that risk? You need to find a good setup and manage the risk with proper share size and stop loss.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.” You do not want to do that. You must follow the rules of your strategy. You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss. You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss. And if you ended up taking an $800 loss, it would be really hard to recover from that. Take the quick losses, get out, and come back when the timing is better.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.

A good setup is an opportunity for you to get into a trade with as little risk as possible. That means you might be risking $100, but you have the potential to make $300. You would call that a 3 to 1 profit-to-loss ratio.

Good traders will not take trades with profit-to-loss ratios of less than 2 to 1. That means if you buy $1,000 worth of stock, and are risking $100 on it, you must sell it for at least $1,200 so you will make at least $200. Of course, if the price comes down to $900, you must accept the loss and exit the trade with only $900 (a $100 loss).

Your stop loss should be at a reasonable technical level.

Any stop loss below VWAP is meaningless in this case, because the stock can make a normal pull back toward VWAP at any time and then continue to sell off toward your target.

You are always looking for opportunities to get low-risk entries with big win potential.

As a beginner trader you may not be able to differentiate between a range of setups. It may be difficult for you to recognize what a home-run Bull Flag is and what will end up being a “false breakout”.

You can learn from videos on YouTube and Google. You can also join our chatroom where I explain my trades in real time while I am trading them. You will be able to observe me, my monitor and my trading platform.

Using a 2 to 1 win:lose ratio, I can be wrong 40% of the time and still make money.

Again, your job as a day trader is managing risk, it is not buying and selling stocks. Your broker is buying and selling stocks for you in the market. Your job is to manage your risk and your account. Whenever you click “buy” in your trading platform, you expose your money to a risk.

Chapter 4 focuses on finding the right Stocks in Play for day trading.

You must avoid stocks that (1) are heavily traded by computers and institutional traders, (2) have small relative trading volume, (3) are penny stocks and are therefore highly manipulated, and (4) don’t have any reason to move (no fundamental catalysts).

If you are targeting $1,000 a day, then 10 or 20 shares might not be enough. You either have to take more shares or increase your account size. If you don’t have enough money to trade for a $1,000 daily target, you should lower your daily goal.

I am holding around $25,000 in my trading account and I usually choose 800 shares to trade. My daily goal is $500 or $120,000/year. That is sufficient for my lifestyle. What is your trading goal?.

That’s right. Milk. 2%. You should never risk more than 2% of your account on any given trade.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000. If you have only been able to save up a modest amount of funds for day trading, then you have no choice but to trade in smaller numbers of shares. Make it one of your unbreakable rules. It will be difficult to move on, but if as you stare at your monitors you see a possible setup that could cost you more than 2% of your trading account, just move on and look for another trade.

If you have only been able to save up a modest amount of funds for day trading, then you have no choice but to trade in smaller numbers of shares. Make it one of your unbreakable rules. It will be difficult to move on, but if as you stare at your monitors you see a possible setup that could cost you more than 2% of your trading account, just move on and look for another trade. With every single trade you make, you should always ensure that at least 98% of your account is protected.

Three-Step Risk Management Step 1: Determine your maximum dollar risk for the trade you’re planning (never more than 2% of your account). Calculate this before your trading day starts. Step 2: Estimate your maximum risk per share, the strategy stop loss, in dollars, from your entry. This comes from the strategies set out in Chapter 7, where I explain in each strategy what the stop loss should be. Step 3: Divide “1” by “2” to find the absolute maximum number of shares you are allowed to trade each time. To better illustrate this, let’s return to the example of MOH from a few pages back. If you have a $40,000 account, the 2% rule will limit your risk on any trade to $800. Let’s assume you want to be conservative and risk only 1% of that account, or $400. That will be Step 1. As you monitor MOH, you see a situation develop where the VWAP Strategy (see Chapter 7) may very well work in your favor. You decide to sell short the stock at $50, and you want to cover them at $48.80, with a stop loss at $50.40. You will be risking $0.40 per share. That will be Step 2 of risk control. For Step 3, calculate your share size by dividing “Step 1” by “Step 2” to find the maximum size you may trade. In this example, you will be allowed to buy a maximum of 1,000 shares.

In this case, you may not have enough cash or buying power to buy 1,000 shares of MOH at $50 (because you have only $40,000 in your account). So instead you will buy 800 shares or, perhaps, even 500 shares. Remember, you can always risk less, but you are not allowed to risk more than 2% of your account under any circumstance.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If break of moving average will yield a $600 loss, and you have set a $400 maximum loss per trade, then you should either take fewer shares in that trade or not take that trade at all and wait for another opportunity.

I understand that calculating your stop loss and maximum loss in your account size in a live trade is difficult. Remember Rule 2? Day trading is not supposed to be easy. Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account.

Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account. It sounds crazy at the beginning, but you will quickly learn how to manage your account and your risk per trade. You will be amazed at how rapidly the human brain can do calculations on what share size to take and where to set the stop loss.

One trader might become discouraged, curse the market, and give up for the day. Another trader might become frustrated,.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally. Their confidence and peace of mind are connected to their trading results. When traders do well, they feel good. When they encounter losses, they become discouraged, doubtful, and frustrated, questioning themselves, their strategy and their career. Instead of dealing directly and constructively with their losses, they react to the emotions triggered by personalizing the events.

Successful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money.

Successful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money. Almost all professional traders hide their unrealized Profit and Loss (P&L) column while in a trade. They have no interest in seeing how much they are up or down. They focus on the perfect execution of a profit target or a stop loss level.

Consistently profitable traders take every negative or positive trade they make as an opportunity to improve themselves.

Every morning, you should scan the market, find the opportunities, and sometimes in a matter of seconds make decisions on whether you should buy or sell or sell short the Stock in Play, and you need to make that call with a high degree of discipline.

One of the key contributors to traders’ self-discipline is their physical and mental health. People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders.

One of the key contributors to traders’ self-discipline is their physical and mental health. People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders. You may be surprised to read this, but your state of alertness, your energy level, and your overall health have a significant impact on your daily trading results. Those who neglect these aspects of their well-being or, even worse, abuse alcohol or drugs, will find it difficult to concentrate and make good decisions.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process. It is difficult to make and sustain the required mental efforts for day trading when you lack proper sleep or feel down from a lack of exercise. Very often, your moods are influenced by your physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much you eat.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process. It is difficult to make and sustain the required mental efforts for day trading when you lack proper sleep or feel down from a lack of exercise. Very often, your moods are influenced by your physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much you eat. Keep a daily record of both your trading results and your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping your body, and thus your mind, in their peak operating condition.

Aspects of personal lives outside of trading can also affect effectiveness as a trader. Changes in personal relationships such as breakup or divorce, family issues like illness, and financial problems can reduce a person’s ability to focus and make appropriate decisions.

It certainly took time, but I found that the more and more I practiced, the more effectively I was able to execute my trading strategies (that I will explain later).

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade.

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade. You need to have a well-thought-out plan and you need to follow that plan.

This is what many traders find difficult. All of these decisions, the very process of ensuring these decisions fit into your risk tolerance and your strategy parameters, are a tough multitasking call.

I understand that stress. There have been times when I've been in the trade, had an $80,000 position, and all I needed to do was to sell. But as I was looking at my keyboard, I found myself frozen like the proverbial deer in the headlights. I couldn’t even figure out which keys to punch. This sort of paralysis is not unusual when you’re overwhelmed. It happens to every single one of us. But remember, confidence in trading doesn’t arise from being right and profitable in all of your trades, it comes from surviving the occasions of being wrong and losing money.

Trading is stressful. Active day trading is perhaps the most stressful of all trading periods. One mistake can ruin your month. One missed proper profit taking can ruin your week. There is a fine line between being a good trader and being a losing trader. If you are under pressure, don’t make any trades. Take a walk to release your stress and do not restart trading until you are once again focused and calm. Often trading professionals will refresh their minds by going for a run after a bad loss, and then come back to restart trading, but in a simulator and not live, until they are back on track emotionally.

You must take the time to prepare, you must work hard, you must plan your trades, you must take the time afterwards to review your trades, and you cannot do it alone. You cannot succeed on your own. There is so much value in sharing ideas and learning from a community of traders and, should you have one, your mentor.

Are you trading profitably? Have you had five wins in a row or have you had five losses in a row? If you are on a losing streak, will you be in touch with your own emotions and maintain your composure, or will you let your judgment be impaired?.

Once you’ve learned it, the skill of identifying a good stock to trade will not go away.

But it's important to remember that if you start to get over-confident and think you’ve outsmarted the market on trading wisdom, or that you don’t need to learn any more, you’ll often get a quick reminder from that market. You’ll lose money and you will see that the market is correcting you.

I will reiterate: being able to make quick decisions and being able to make and then follow your trading rules are critical for success in the market. As you continue through this book, you are going to read much about risk management. Everything that traders do comes back to risk management because ultimately it is the most important concept for a trader to understand.

Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. You cannot be a successful day trader without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.

But never forget the previously explained 2% rule. Do not take a trade if more than 2% of your account will be put in jeopardy. It very simply is not worth the risk.

There’s a very simple truth that you must accept: you should not expect to be right all of the time. It’s impossible to be. Trading is based on probabilities, and it requires a great deal of patience to identify setups with attractive risk/reward potential. I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day. There would be days when you wouldn’t have enough customers or sales even to support your staff or your lease, but these would be more than offset by days when your business prospered.

If you examine the work of most successful traders, they all take many small losses. Their results are littered with numerous small losses of 7c (cents), 5c, 3c, and even 1c per share. Most good day traders have few losses that are more than 30c per share. Most winning trades should work for you right away.

One of the fundamentals you must learn from this book is that every day trading strategy comes with a stop loss level and you must stop out from stocks that trade against your strategy.

Imagine for a moment that you are shorting a stock below an important resistance level and you are waiting for the price to go lower. That is fine. But suddenly the price turns against you and breaks the resistance level and trades higher. Now your original trade plan is obsolete. You have no reason to stay in the trade. You cannot wait in the trade in the hope that the stock may trade lower again. That is wishful thinking. You can wipe out your trading account with ONE crazy move. The stock may or may not trade lower again, but above the resistance level you have no reason to be short in the stock. If the stock was weak and comes back below the level, you may enter the trade again. Commissions are cheap, so accept a small loss and get out. You can always get back into the trade when the setup is ready.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator. You should move to live trading only if you have mastered accepting and respecting your stop loss. If you don’t know where your stop loss is or where it should be, it means than perhaps you should not be in that trade in the first place. It means you have not planned it correctly. It also means you should step back to reading about and reviewing your strategies and return to again trade in the simulator.

Consistently profitable traders just make sound and reasonable trades. They accept that they cannot control the market or results on every single trade, but they stick to their plan and control their capital. Often you can review your profit and loss at the end of the month. Professional traders often review their P&L quarterly, and then make a decision on their performance and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules. The normal uncertainty of the stock market will result in some of your days being negative, but that does not mean that a negative day was a bad trading day.

“You are only as good as the stocks that you trade.”.

You can be the best trader in the world, but if your stocks do not move, nor have enough volume, then you cannot make money consistently.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted. As a day trader, you must be efficient with your time and buying power (which will be explained in Chapter.

Now, we don’t want stocks to just move, but we seek stocks where we can identify that they are about to move in a certain direction. It is possible that a stock that moves $5 intraday may never offer us excellent risk/reward opportunities. Some stocks move too much intraday without foreshadowing their direction.

I certainly experienced this as a new trader. If you learn the strategies explained in Chapter 7, but you cannot make money consistently, it is possible that you are in the wrong stock.

Again, you are only as good as the stocks you trade.

There is more than one way to select Stocks in Play and make money trading them, and there is definitely more than one correct way.

Some day traders like my friend Trader Brian trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) exclusively.

Many have developed proprietary filters to find stocks. Others concentrate on trading the markets as a whole with index Futures.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:5.

Trading the right Stocks in Play help you to combat algorithmic programs.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels which we can trade off from.

You must remember that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume. If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

Interestingly enough, when you take a close look at the chart, you realize that on those days the stock gapped up or down.

The other days were comprised of just normal, high frequency, algorithmic trading. Retail traders should stay away from stocks that are trading normally.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing.

How do you recognize the behavior of the market? Index funds such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500 (SPY) are usually good indicators of what the overall market is doing. If the Dow.

If the Dow Jones or the SPY are red, it means that the overall market is weak. If the Dow Jones or the SPY are strong, then the overall market will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume is independent of the overall market; they are Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are.

In day trading, Alpha stocks are the ones that are independent of both the overall market and their sector.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares. You need certain liquidity in the stock to be able to get in and out of the stock without difficulty.

What makes a stock a Stock in Play? Usually it is the release of fundamental news about the stock either the day before or during the same trading day.

I check the news on all stocks up or down more than 2% pre-market and shortlist my Gappers watchlist (which I will explain further along in this book). Stocks in Play the day before are often still in play for a few days after.

In Chapter 7, I explain specific day trading strategies such as Momentum, Reversal, VWAP, and Moving Average. For the moment, your main question needs to be, how do I find the stock for each strategy? I categorize stocks for retail trading into three classes. Based on my experiences, this categorization provides some clarity on how to find stocks and on how to adopt a strategy for them.

Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

Low float stocks can be volatile and move very fast. Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

These low float stocks are also called “ small cap ” or “ micro-cap ” stocks. Day traders love low float stocks. Now let’s return to those three categories.

Low float stocks under $10 are often highly manipulated and difficult to trade, and therefore only very experienced and highly equipped retail traders should trade these stocks.

The first category consists of low float stocks that are priced under $10.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock. No beginner or even intermediate trader can trade with such accuracy and efficiency.

When it comes to low float stocks, the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy — which I detail in Chapter 7 —works best. The other strategies in this book are not suitable for low float sub-$10 stocks.

Trading low float stocks is very difficult for the new trader. It is difficult to read the direction of their next move and therefore they are very difficult to manage your risk while trading them. I discourage new traders from trading low float stocks. When the new trader is wrong, the loss is such that it wipes out many gains.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares. Many of my strategies explained in this book work well on these stocks, especially the VWAP and Support or Resistance Strategies. Medium float stocks that are more expensive than $100 are not popular among retail day traders and I myself avoid them. You usually cannot buy many shares of them because of their high price. Therefore, it is basically useless to day trade them. Leave them for the institutional traders.

The third category of stocks for trading is m ega cap stocks like Apple, Alibaba, Yahoo, Microsoft and Home Depot. These are well established companies that usually have over $500 million in public shares available for trading. These stocks are traded in millions of shares every day. As you may guess, these stocks move only when large institutional traders, investment banks, and hedge funds are buying or selling large positions. Retail traders like us, who typically trade 100 to 1,000 shares, usually cannot move the price of these stocks. Retail traders should avoid these stocks unless there is a good fundamental catalyst for them.

From the strategies set forth in Chapter 7, Reversals and Moving Average Strategies usually work well on these stocks.

Do not forget though, unless there is a fundamental catalyst, these stocks are being heavily traded by computers and high frequency traders and are not suitable for retail day trading.

Low float (less than 10 million) Under $10 Only Momentum (Long) Medium float (10-500 million) $10-$100 All, mostly VWAP and Support or Resistance Large float (+500 million) Any (usually +$20) All, mostly Moving Average and Reversal.

Stocks in Play can be found in two ways: Pre-market morning watchlist Real time intraday scans.

Experienced traders are sensitive to being in the right stocks at the right time. As I mentioned, traders are just as good as the stocks they trade. I and the traders in my community use a scanner every morning that I program to find Stocks in Play based on the following criteria:.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2%.

Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market.

Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

Stocks that have Average True Range of at least 50 cents (how large of a range a stock has on average every day).

There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

As a rule, I do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out).

I look for highly traded stocks, so that buying and selling 1,000 shares won’t be a problem. That is why I am looking at stocks with an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

When there are some fundamental catalysts, there will be unusual pre-market activity and a Stock in Play will have gapped up or down before the market opens with a significant number of shares being traded (such as 50,000 shares).

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily.

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily. That is a good number.

If you have 1,000 shares, you may profit $1,000 from the trade. But if ATR is only 10 cents, then that trading range is not attractive for me.

As you can see, I have highlighted the Gap (%) and Float columns on my watchlist.

From over 4,000 stocks, I now have only eight candidates. I will go over each of them before the market opens at 9:30 a.m. I will check the news on each of them to learn why they gapped up or down. Is there a fundamental catalyst for that stock? Has there been any news coverage or extreme events for that company?.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups. I plan my trades before the market opens (I provide some thoughts on how to create if-then statements in Chapter 9) and then I wait for the market bell. I then trade my plan.

A high short interest indicates traders or investors think a stock’s price is likely to fall. But the challenge with high short interest is that these stocks are more prone to a short squeeze by bullish investors and traders. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers panic and are scrambling to return their borrowed shares, forcing prices to increase quickly and dangerously. You do not want to be stuck short in a short squeeze.

Figure 4.3 below is a screenshot of a scanner on my Trade Ideas software (see Chapter 5) that is set to find real time stocks for me that:.

Have gapped up or down at least $1.

Have ATR of more than 50 cents.

Have average relative volume of at least 1.5 (the stock is trading at 1.5 times its normal volume).

Have average daily trading volume of at least 500,000 shares.

Having ATR of more than 50 cents is important because you want the stock to move enough during the day so you can make a profit out of its volatility.

There is no point in trading a stock that is moving only 5 cents on average in a day.

I will also take a look at the sector of stocks. If I have a few stocks in one sector, there is a good chance that these stocks are not in play. They have high relative volume because their sector is under heavy trading by institutional traders. It is important to know that stocks usually trade with their sector.

Remember, you are only as good as the stock you trade, so if you are the best trader in the world, but in a wrong stock, you will lose money.

If you join a community of day traders such as mine, you will be able to see my scanner in real time. These scanners are costly, around $100 per month, so at the beginning of your career transition to day trading, you will probably want to keep your expenses down as much as possible.

Sometimes you have to plan a trade in a few minutes and at other times in just a few seconds. This is why you need months of training in simulator accounts to well understand the decision making process.

This strategy involves taking only the best setups and waiting on the sidelines until I see something worth trading.

Day trading can be a boring profession – most of the time you are just sitting and watching your list. In fact, if day trading is not boring for you, then you are probably overtrading.

Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) enforce laws that limit the number of trades a trader can make if they are undercapitalized. The rules adopt the term "pattern day trader", which includes any person that day trades (buys and then sells or sells short and then buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five business days. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that they day trade. The required minimum equity must be in their account prior to any day trading activities. If the account falls below the $25,000 requirement, the pattern day trader will not be permitted to day trade again until their account is restored to the $25,000 minimum equity level.

Although many new traders who do not have more than $25,000 in their account do not appreciate this rule, and see it as a barrier, it actually is in place to protect amateur traders from losing their limited capital to the high fees and commissions of brokers.

Direct-access brokers are the answer to this question. These firms concentrate on speed and order execution - unlike a full-service broker that focuses on research and advice to investors.

As mentioned above, the PDT rule applies, meaning CenterPoint Securities requires at least $25,000 (for U.S. residents only) to open an account.

They are offering members of our community a flat commission rate of $2.95/trade, regardless of share size in your trade. This is an astoundingly low fee, compared to the typical $4.95/trade charge of many other brokers.

When a broker notices that you are using leverage and losing money, they might issue a “ margin call ” to you. A margin call is a serious warning and day traders must avoid getting them. It means that your loss is now equal to the original money you had in your account. You must add more money or else your broker will freeze your account. If you need to know more about margin, leverage or margin calls, check the broker’s website, do some research on the Internet, email me, or ask other traders in your chatroom.

If your broker doesn't use a platform or software that has Hotkeys, you're not going to get in and out of trades fast enough.

Swing traders enter and exit trades within days or weeks, therefore end-of-day data that is available on the Internet for free is sufficient for them.

A bid is always lower, an ask is always higher, and the difference is called the bid-ask spreads.

The most important information you must take away from Level 2 is the bid-ask spreads. Spreads are higher in lower volume traded stocks, as the market makers who dominate such stocks demand higher fees from those who want to join their party.

The bid-ask spreads are likely to be small, perhaps only one cent on a quiet day in an actively traded stock. They grow wider as prices accelerate on the way up or down and may become huge—I have seen up to $2—after a severe drop or a very sharp rally.

Here is what I have on my charts: Price action in the form of candlesticks Volume of shares being traded 9 Exponential Moving Average (9 EMA) 20 Exponential Moving Average (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average (50 SMA) 200 Simple Moving Average (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price.

I don’t trade without knowing nearby significant intraday levels of support or resistance.

I keep the color of all my moving average indicators in grey except VWAP which is colored in blue. VWAP is the most important day trading indicator and needs to be easily and quickly distinguished from other moving averages.

I don’t want to have a lot of colors on my charts so I maintain a white background with mostly red and black coloring. Heavily colored charts are confusing and over the long term irritate your eyes and limit your vision.

If you place a market order, it will be filled at the current price, whatever that happens to be. A limit order, on the other hand, allows you to specify the maximum or minimum price you will accept.

In market orders, essentially, you are getting filled at the bad side of bid-ask spreads. A market order buys at the ask (high side) and sells at the bid (low side).

The problem with using market orders is that the market can quickly change, and so then does the bid-ask spread, and thus you may get your order filled at a very bad price. For example, if the bid-ask spread is $10.95-$10.97, market orders should buy immediately at $10.97 for you, right? When your market orders come to the Exchange, the market can quickly change to $11.10-$11.15, and therefore your buy market order will be filled at $11.15. That is a 15 cents slippage. And that is really bad.

Market makers and many professional traders make a good living from filling market orders. I discourage traders from placing market orders at any time. A market order is like a blank check. Most of the time a market order will be filled very closely to the quoted bid or ask price, but sometimes you will get a nasty surprise.

Use limit orders whenever possible.

Swing traders commonly use limit orders.

“Buy me now, but up to this price! Not higher!” “Sell me now, but down to this price! Not lower!”.

I use marketable limit orders for all of my day trades. I typically buy at the “ask+5 cents” and sell at the “bid-5 cents”. In the next section, I will show you details of my order Hotkeys.

In my opinion, it is almost impossible to day trade profitably without using Hotkeys.

You may have noticed in Figure 5.4 that I have different Hotkeys for when a stock is in Short Selling Restriction (SSR) mode. An SSR is triggered when a stock is down 10% or more from the previous day's close. In that case, regulators and the Exchanges restrict short selling of the stock when its price is dropping. You can only sell short on the ask, you cannot sell short directly to the buyers (on the bid). It means that the priority for selling is for the sellers who currently hold positions, not for the short sellers who are wanting to profit from the downward movement. If you want to sell short, you have to queue up on the ask side and wait for buyers to come to you. Real sellers, on the other hand, can accept bids from buyers and get rid of their positions.

Part of your education includes trading in simulators for a few months, and during these months, you must master your Hotkeys.

Another important reminder is to always use a wired keyboard that is plugged into your computer. Wireless keyboards can send repeat keystrokes, errant keystrokes, or can fail to send orders at all, especially when low in battery power.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using. One time I spilled water on my keyboard while trading. My keyboard stopped working. Fortunately, I did not have any open position at that moment.

One of the common challenges that new traders mention is not knowing what to trade.

Never forget that successful traders are independent thinkers.

The Japanese began using technical analysis and some early versions of candlesticks to trade rice in the 17 th century.

Rule 9: Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.

At every moment in the market there are basically three categories of traders: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided traders. The actual prices of transactions are the result of the actions of all of these traders at a particular point in time: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided.

In day trading, the difference between the two is called the bid-ask spread (Chapter 5).

Buyers are buying because they expect that prices will go up. Buying by bulls pushes the market up, or as I like to phrase it, “Buyers are in control.” The result is that buyers are willing to pay higher and higher prices and to bid on top of each other. They are apprehensive that they will end up paying higher prices if they don’t buy now. Undecided traders accelerate price increases by creating a feeling of urgency among the buyers, who then buy quickly and cause prices to go higher.

The goal of a successful day trader is to figure out if the sellers will end up in control or if the buyers will end up in control, and then make a calculated move, at the appropriate time, quickly and stealthily.

Your job is to analyze the balance of the power between buyers and sellers and bet on the winning group. Fortunately, candlestick charts reflect this fight and mass psychology in action. A successful day trader is a social psychologist behind a computer and charting software. Day trading is the study of mass psychology.

Candles are always born neutral. After birth, they can grow to become either bearish, bullish or, on rare occasions, neither. When a candle is born, traders do not know what it will become. They may speculate but they do not truly know what a candle is until it dies (closes). After a candle is born, the battle begins. The bulls and the bears fight it out, and the candle displays who is winning. If buyers are in control, you will see the candle move up and form a bullish candle. If sellers are in control of the price, you will see the candle move down and become a bearish candle. You may be thinking that this is all very obvious, but many traders don’t see candles as a fight between buyers and sellers. That little candle is an excellent indicator that tells you who is currently winning the battle, the bulls (buyers) or the bears (sellers).

Just by learning to read candlesticks, you will begin to generate an opinion on the general attitude for a stock. Again, this is called the “ price action.

Understanding who is in control of the price is an extremely important skill in day trading.

Day trading truly is the study of mass psychology during the day.

Back in Chapter 2 I used the example of a sandbox in a schoolyard. You don’t want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. If you are, you’re in the wrong place. If the buyers are strong, you want to be buying and holding. If the sellers are strong, you want to be selling and selling short. You definitely do not want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. You want to be where the action is. And if you can’t decide what that action is, if it looks like it’s a toss-up, don’t do anything.

Similarly, if a Doji forms in a bearish downward trend, it suggests that the bears have become exhausted and the bulls (buyers) are fighting back to take control of the price.

Always remember that these candles only indicate indecision and not a definite reversal.

As a day trader, you shouldn’t care about companies and their earnings. Day traders are not concerned about what companies do or what they make. Your attention should only be on price action, technical indicators and chart patterns. I know more stock symbols than the names of actual companies.

I don't mingle fundamental analysis with technical analysis while making a trade; I focus exclusively on the technical indicators.

I’ve come to recognize in my trading career that the best setups are the nine strategies that I will be explaining in this chapter.

These are simple strategies in theory, but they are difficult to master and require plenty of practice.

Another point to remember is that in the market right now, over 60% of the volume is algorithmic high frequency trading. That means you are trading against computers.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute charts.

And please, remember, my philosophy of trading is that you must master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method will work to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is what separates the winners from the losers.

Two traders enter into a trade based on one strategy. The positions go their way and then pull back a bit. The first trader fears losing his gain and takes a quick, small profit. The second trader adds to the position on the pull back and books a large gain. Same idea, different outcomes, all as the result of two different mindsets and trade management styles.

Day trading is a business. Like any other business, success is not just about products and services but much of it will be the result of an excellent management of the business. For example, if you don’t hire the right people for your business, or supervise them properly, or track your inventory, you’ll fail to make money with even the best products and services.

Rather, trade management is referring to what you do with the position after you’ve entered it and before you’ve exited it.

Novice traders believe that when they enter the trade, they should not do anything else but patiently wait for the price to hit their profit target or stop loss level. This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea.

This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea. As the market moves after your entry, you will receive new price action and data about your initial trade idea: the price action of the stock is either supporting or not supporting your reasons for being in that trade. Therefore, you need to manage your open position.

For example, if you are expecting a break from a strong support level to the downside, and you want to profit the move to the downside with a short position, you may want to start with shorting 100 shares. Momentum scalper traders will usually start scalping when the level breaks to the downside. When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level.

Momentum scalper traders will usually start scalping when the level breaks to the downside. When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level. If it is held below the support level (now acting as a resistance level), you can start adding to your short position on the way down. If it does not act as a resistance level and the price moves back up, you will get stopped out for a small loss because you only had 100 shares.

I’ll discuss scalping and scalpers further in the section that follows on the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick. Often my friend Brian Pez and I will trade against each other, but we will both be profitable when we finish our day. And how does that happen? It’s based on practice, discipline and controlling our emotions in the heat of the trade, even though I do like to think that I’m a better trader than him!.

In other trades, you just want to go for a “taste” and perhaps add more later. Learning when to have the most size is a skill that new traders must acquire.

No matter how good of an opportunity, you may not risk more than 2% of your account in one trade. Live to trade another day.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size. Likewise, you can lose a great deal of money trading in and out of an active stock with too big of a size.

For example, for low float stocks that can move 10% or 20% in a matter of seconds, I never take a large position, even though their price is typically low (in the range of $1-$10) and I have sufficient buying power for a very large position.

My trade size depends on the price of the stock and on my account size and risk management rule (Chapter 3), but 800 shares is my usual size if I am trading in the $10-$50 price range.

If the trade goes in my favor, I add another 400 shares (note that I add into my winning position, not into a losing one).

I sell 400 shares in the first target, bringing my stop loss to break-even (my entry point).

I always retain some shares in case the prices keep moving in my favor.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100. The more expensive stocks are less attractive to retail traders and are often dominated by computers and institutional traders.

Their initial share size might be relatively small, but traders will add to their position as the price action validates their idea.

For example, for a 1,000-share trade, they enter either 500/500 or 100/200/700 shares. If done correctly, this is an excellent method of risk and trade management.

I rarely scale down into a losing trade. I always scale up ; I add to my winning position.

Averaging down losing positions is perhaps the most common mistake a beginner will make and that will almost certainly lead to the end of their short trading career.

Remember, averaging down does not work for day traders. I have tried it. 85% of the time you will profit when you average down. But the 15% of the time you are wrong, you will blow up your account.

Remember, it only takes ONE bad trade to blow up your account and for you to be done with your day trading career forever.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished. I thought the sell off must be a normal pull back. During that time, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3x Shares (ticker: LABU) started to sell off too, and its share price dropped from $148 to below $60. I purchased 100 shares at $120 with the hope that it would go back to $148. It did not. It went below $100. I added an additional 100 shares. My average was now $110. It plunged further to $80. I added 200 more. My average became $90. It went further to $60. I added 400 shares more (and I was almost out of money). My average became $70 and I held a huge 800 share position on LABU. It dropped further to $58. I was just long, and I was so very wrong. I got a margin call from my broker. I could not add further money because I did not have any. My broker froze my account and sold my position. I had the most devastating loss in my trading career. Two days later LABU rebounded to over $100.

I said to myself, if I only had a bigger account….

I don’t know why, but traders such as Brian Hunter will at times stubbornly put being right about their decision over making money. These are the types of traders who conveniently forget that the market can remain irrational longer than they can survive in the game. You cannot let your pride get the best of you. If you’ve made a bad decision, take a loss and get out early. Predictions and speculations have their place, but the price action of the stock is the most important indicator for traders like us. If you believe in an irrefutable trading opinion and the price action does not confirm your bias, then simply do not make the trade.

You want to enter the trade, but you should not chase the trade, because at point B it is very extended and already at a high price. In addition, you cannot say where your stop loss should be. You must never enter a trade without knowing where your stop is.

When they announced that they had a new $50 million contract to build a new ship (There’s a fundamental catalyst! Remember Chapter 2?).

Knew that when the price went higher, closer.

I knew that when the price went higher, closer to B, buyers would jump on massively.

Close to point D, the volume suddenly spiked, which meant that many more traders were jumping into the trade.

My profit target was when the stock made a new low on a 5-minute chart, which was a sign of weakness.

When I observe with my scanner or I’m advised by someone in our chatroom that a stock is surging up from point A and reaching a significant new high for the day (point B), I wait to see if the price makes a support higher than point A. I call this point C. I do not jump into the trade right away.

I watch the stock during its consolidation period (I’ll explain this term in the next strategy). I choose my share size and stop and exit strategy.

When I see that the price is holding support at level C, I enter the trade close to the price of point C in anticipation of moving forward to point D or higher.

My stop is the loss of point C. If the price goes lower than point C, I sell and accept the loss. Therefore, it is important to buy the stock close to point C to minimize the loss. Some traders wait and buy only at point D to ensure that the ABCD Pattern is really working. In my opinion, that approach basically reduces your reward while at the same time increasing your risk.

If the price moves higher, I sell half of my position at point D, and bring my stop higher to my entry point (break-even).

I sell the remaining position as soon as my target hits or I sense that the price is losing steam or that the sellers are acquiring control of the price action. When the price makes a new low on my 5-minute chart, it is a good indicator that the buyers are almost exhausted.

Consolidation means that the traders who bought stocks at a lower price are now selling and taking their profits. Although that is happening, the price does not decrease sharply because the buyers are still entering into trades and the sellers are not yet in control of the price. Many traders who missed buying the stock before the Bull Flag started, will now be looking for an opportunity to take a trade.

Wise traders know that it is risky to buy a stock when the price is increasing significantly. That’s called “ chasing the stock ”. Professional traders aim to enter the trade during quiet times and take their profits during the volatile times.

They jump in or out when stocks begin to run, but grow bored and lose interest when the prices are, shall I say, sleepy.

Chasing the stocks is an account killer for beginners. You must wait until the stock finds its high point, and then you must wait for the consolidation. As soon as the price start breaking up in the consolidation area, you can begin purchasing stocks. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, patience truly is a virtue.

Third and higher consolidation periods are risky because the price has probably been very extended in a way that indicates that the buyers will soon be losing their control.

I don’t trade more than two Bull Flags in a stock and, as you can see in this chart, the stock started to sell off after the third Bull Flag (at around $7). Aside from the strategy, did you notice that OPTT moved from $1.50 to almost $7 in just 35 minutes? This kind of move can be expected from low float under $10 stocks.

Get in, scalp, and get out quickly. That’s the philosophy of momentum scalpers:.

The Bull Flag is a long-based strategy. You should not short a Bull Flag.

I personally don’t trade much momentum. It is a risky strategy and beginners should be very careful trading these. If you choose to, trade only in a small size and only after sufficient practice in simulators. You will also need a super-fast execution system for scalping.

If you are part of our chatroom, you will hear me say time and time again that what goes up, must come down. Don’t chase the trade if it is too extended . The inverse is also true. What goes down will definitely come back up to some extent.

An RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest. The RSI, developed initially by famous technical analyst Welles Wilder, Jr., is an indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses in price over a period of time to measure the speed and change of price movement. The RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traders in Reversal Strategies use RSI values to identify overbought or oversold conditions and to find buy or sell signals. For example, RSI readings above 90 indicate overbought conditions and RSI readings below 10 indicate oversold conditions. If you.

You must simultaneously look for a certain RSI level and a certain number of consecutive candles.

What you definitely don’t want is to be on the wrong side of a reversal trade, or, as we call it, “ catching a falling knife ”. It doesn’t sound like a good idea in real life and it's not a good idea in trading. It means that when a stock is selling off badly (the falling knife), you don’t want to buy on the assumption that it should bounce. If the stocks are dropping, you want to wait for the confirmation of the reversal.

This will usually be (1) the formation of a Doji or indecision candle and (2) the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high near an important intraday support level. That is my entry point. I set my stop at the low of the previous candlestick or at the loss of the support level.

Institutional traders and hedge funds have started selling their large position to the public market and the stock price is tanking.

Traders have started short selling a stock because of some bad fundamental news, but they will have to cover their shorts sooner or later. That is where you wait for an entry. When short sellers are trying to cover their shorts, the stock will reverse quickly, that is called a “short squeeze”. You want to ride that.

But please, remember the mantra: what goes up, must come down.

Each Reversal Strategy has four important elements: At least five candlesticks on a 5-minute chart moving upward or downward.

The stock is being traded at or near an important intraday support or resistance level.

I only take reversal trades when the price is near a significant support level (for Bottom Reversal) or a significant resistance level (for Top Reversal).

When the trend is coming to an end, usually indecision candles, such as a spinning top or Doji, form. That is when you need to be ready.

A Doji is a candle that has a wick longer than its body.

This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

The same is true about a bullish Doji. You can also see a picture of a bullish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long lower wick that some would call a bottom tail and others would call a hammer. When you have a hammer candle with a bottom tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved down, was unable to hold at those low levels, and was bought up. This indicates a battle between the buyers and the sellers in which the sellers lost their push down. It is a good indication that the buyers may now gain control of the price and push that price up.

You can see a picture of a bearish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long upper wick that some would call a top tail and that others would call a shooting star. This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

In reversal trading, it is best that the RSI be at the extremes (above 90, below 10). Once you find that, you must then look for an actual entry near a strong intraday support (for Bottom Reversal) or resistance level (for Top Reversal).

As mentioned, an entry for me is going to be either the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high (for Bottom Reversal) or to make a new low (for Top Reversal) and only when the price is being traded near an important intraday support or resistance level.

In a Bottom Reversal, when you’ve had a long run of consecutive candles making new lows, the first candle that makes the new high near an important support level is very significant.

The 5-minute chart is cleaner. The first 5-minute candle to make a new high near an intraday support level is the point at which I enter the reversal, with a stop at the low of the day.

Once you’re in one of these trades, your exit indicators are quite simple. I take profit when the price reaches a moving average (either 9 EMA, 20 EMA or VWAP) or reaches another important intraday level.

In a Bottom Reversal, if the stock pops up and then suddenly moves back down, I stop out for a loss. If I jump in long, buying stock and hoping the price will go higher, and instead the price ends up just going sideways, it’s a sign that I am probably going to see a consolidation for another move down, and that is an indication that the price is probably going to continue to drop. If I get in and I hold for a few minutes and the price stays flat, I get out, no matter what happens after that. I may be wrong, but I don’t like to expose my account to the unknown.

I need to be in the right setup, and if it is not ready yet, I’m out. If I get into the profit zone, I can start adjusting my stop, first to break-even, and then to the low of the last 5-minute candle. I will then keep adjusting my stop as I move up.

An indecision candlestick at the bottom of the downtrend signifies a potential reversal, and, as you can see, right after that is a big swing back up.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves. You will probably miss the moment when the stock starts to sell off, and you won’t have time to sell short the stock for profit, but you can always prepare for the reversal trade.

My scanner, at 10:57 a.m., showed me that ALR had seven consecutive candles to the downside, a relatively low float (80 million shares) and a relative volume of 1.21, which meant it was trading higher than usual.

At times, a reversal happens so fast that indecision candlesticks will not form. Therefore, it is important to observe the price action near significant intraday levels, and to of course confirm the reversal with an indication of higher than usual trading volume.

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal. That stock may be a good candidate for a Moving Average Trend trade (explained in the pages to come). You want to find stocks that are really stretched out to the downside or, for short selling, really stretched out to the upside, in a short period of time, and with high volume at the reversal point. You want to see that large extension, which means that you should look for considerable volume at the reversal point (such as the ALR Bottom Reversal in the above example from my scanner that is marked as Figure 7.13).

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal.

Once you find that, you then must look for a couple of key indicators that will suggest that the price may be about to turn, and that is when you then take the position. I’ve said it many times: what goes up, must come down.

Oftentimes these stocks will give up days’ and weeks’ or years’ worth of price gain in just a matter of minutes. It is very critical to be able to correctly time the reversal.

I’ll say it again: the key to your success with Top and Bottom Reversals is trading the extremes at or near a significant daily support or resistance level. How do I quantify these extremes? These are a few of the things that I look for:.

An extreme RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest.

A very high volume of shares being traded. Volume is usually increasing with the direction of price action and is at its maximum at the point of reversal.

Finally, more than five consecutive candles ending with an indecision candle or a Doji is definitely going to catch my attention. These candles usually demonstrate that sellers are losing their control while buyers are becoming more powerful, and that indicates the end of a trend.

Sometimes reversals happen without an indecision candlestick. In those cases, you should look for strong reversal candlesticks – a bullish body for Bottom Reversals and a bearish body for Top Reversals.

I will add a caveat to this final point: there will be times when you will have between five and ten consecutive candles without much price action. They may be drifting down slowly, but not quickly enough for you to sense that it is a good reversal. You must look for a combination of these indicators all occurring at the same time. Never try to go short just because the prices are too high. You should never argue with the crowd’s decision or the market, even if it doesn’t make sense to you. You do not have to run with the crowd - but you should not run against.

Many new traders end up trading with a very poor profit-to-loss ratio because they sell their winners too soon and they hold their losers too long. This is an extremely common habit among new traders. The Reversal Strategy, however, lends itself to having a larger profit-to-loss ratio for new traders.

Set up a scanner to flag stocks with four or more consecutive candlesticks going downward in an extreme manner. When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

I wait for confirmation of a Bottom Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bullish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bullish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant intraday support level, and (3) the RSI must be lower than 10.

When I see the stock make a new 1-minute or 5-minute high, I buy the stock.

My stop loss is the low of the previous red candlestick or the low of the day.

My profit target is either (1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price, described later in this chapter) or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) the stock makes a new 5-minute low, which means that the buyers are exhausted and the sellers are once again gaining control.

(remember, we retail traders look for unusual trading volumes).

Wait for confirmation of a Top Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bearish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bearish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant resistance level at high volume, and (3) the RSI must be higher than 90.

When I see the stock make a new 5-minute low, I consider this as a sign of weakness. I start short selling the stock if I have shares available to short.

(1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) when the stock makes a new 5-minute high, which means the buyers are once again gaining control and the sellers are exhausted.

Some day traders focus exclusively on reversal trades and in fact base their entire careers on them. Reversal trades are certainly the most classic of the various strategies with a very good risk/reward ratio and, interestingly, virtually every trading day you will find stocks that are good candidates for reversal trades. I myself am trading more and more reversal trades these days, especially during late morning and afternoon trading. However, reversal trading is not yet the cornerstone of my trading strategies. I am more of a VWAP and Support or Resistance trader, which I will explain later on in this book.

These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

In three areas marked on the chart, the price broke the 9 EMA and went slightly higher, but a 5-minute candlestick did not actually close above 9 EMA. These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

I quickly look at the previous days’ trading data (on a 1-minute or 5-minute chart) to see if the stock is responding to these moving averages.

If the stock is moving really high away from the moving average, offering me an equally really nice unrealized profit, I may take some profit, usually at half-position.

Traders say: you can never go broke by taking good profits. If the price pulls back to the moving average, I may add again to my position and continue the trend trade.

Personally don’t trade very often based on moving averages. I look at them to see potential levels of support or resistance, but I rarely make any trade based upon a trend because, in a trend trade strategy, you are usually left exposed in the market for a considerable length of time. Some trend trades can last as long as several hours and that is too long for my personality. I would like to take my profit in a matter of minutes. I rarely will wait even an hour. Another reason that I do not often trade these strategies is that they usually best work during Mid-day and the Close. At the Open (in the morning session), when volatility is high, it’s hard to identify a Moving Average Trend play. These slow trends are best identified during Mid-day, when there is low volatility, and they usually end near the Close (around 3 p.m. New York time) when the professional traders on Wall Street start to dominate the trading.

The combination of all of these factors have led me to be a VWAP trader who sometimes trades with the Opening Range Breakout Strategy.

However, I want to emphasize that trading strategies are not something that you can imitate just from reading a book, speaking with a mentor, or attending a class. You have to slowly and methodically develop your preferred method and then stick with it. There is nothing wrong with any strategy if it works for you. There is no good and bad in any of these strategies; it truly is a matter of personal choice.

VWAP is an indicator of who is in control of the price action - the buyers or the sellers. When stock is traded above the VWAP, it means that the buyers are in overall control of the price and there is a buying demand on the stock. When a stock price breaks below the VWAP, it is safe to assume that the sellers are gaining control over the price action.

VWAP is often used to measure the trading efficiency of institutional traders. Professional traders working for investment banks or hedge funds who need to trade large amount of shares each day cannot enter or exit the market by just one single order. The market is not liquid enough to enter a one-million share buy order. Therefore, they need to liquidate their orders slowly during the day. After buying or selling a large position in a stock during the day, institutional traders compare their price to VWAP values.

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market).

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market). Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points.

Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points. Institutional traders with large orders try to buy or sell large positions around VWAP.

Traders who buy significantly higher than VWAP may be penalized because they cost the institution money for taking that large position. Institutional traders therefore try to buy below or as close to VWAP as possible. Conversely, when a professional trader has to get rid of a large position, they try to sell at the VWAP or higher. Day traders who know this may benefit from this market activity.

Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

After the market opens, the Stock in Play will trade heavily in the first five minutes. If the Stock in Play has gapped up, some individual shareholders, hedge funds or investment banks may want to as soon as possible sell their shares for a profit, before the price drops. At the same time, some investors wanting to take positions in the stock want to buy as soon as possible before the price goes even higher. Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

After volatility decreases around ten to fifteen minutes into the Open, the stock will move toward or away from the VWAP. This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

Conversely, if there are large shareholders wanting to get rid of their shares, then this is a good point for them to liquidate their positions. They start selling their shares at the VWAP. The price will reject the VWAP and start to move down. This is an excellent short selling opportunity for day traders. If there is no interest in the stock from market makers or institutions, the price may trade sideways near VWAP. Wise traders will then stay away from that stock.

When a stock tries to break the VWAP but cannot, you can short the stock because you can safely assume that the other traders that are watching will also begin to short. A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts. Let's.

A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts.

I sold another position at $22 because I know half-dollars (such as $1.50, $2.50, $3.50) and whole dollars ($1, $2, $3) usually act at a support or resistance level.

When I make my watchlist for the day, I monitor the price action around VWAP at the Open. If a stock shows respect toward VWAP, then I wait until a confirmation of the VWAP break (for short selling) or VWAP support (for going long).

I usually buy as close as possible to VWAP to minimize my risk. My stop will be a break and a close 5-minute close below VWAP. For short selling, I short near VWAP with a stop loss of a close above the VWAP. I keep the trade until I hit my profit target or until I reach a new support or resistance level. I usually sell half-positions near the profit target or support or resistance level and move my stop up to my entry point or break-even.

Many traders love to draw diagonal trend lines. I’m not one of them.

Horizontal support or resistance trading is my favorite style of trading. Because market only remembers price levels, which is why horizontal support or resistance lines on previous price levels make sense, but diagonal trend lines aren’t. In fact, in my opinion, trend lines are among the most deceptive of all tools in trading. I therefore avoid trend lines.

Traders buy at support and sell at resistance, making their effectiveness a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Chapter 4: a stock that has fundamental catalysts such as news, an extreme earnings report or a new drug approval.

Finding price support or resistance levels is tricky and requires trading experience. If you watch me trading every morning, you will see how I place my support or resistance lines on my Stocks in Play.

In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or Moving Averages or other chart patterns that I earlier discussed.

You will usually see indecision candles in the area of support or resistance because that is where buyers and sellers are closely fighting each other.

For day trading, it is better to draw support or resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support or resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on. Previous extreme high and low wicks have been made by day traders, so you should look at those.

All of these levels are extreme price levels for the previous days and, as I explained, I give more attention to wicks and extreme prices than I do to the open or close prices.

Do you see that they are significantly higher near those levels? A high volume confirms that these levels are significant and day traders should pay attention to them.

If the current price of a stock is higher than the previous day close (for Stocks in Play that gapped up), the market is moving from a Green day to a Red day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be negative, which will be shown as red in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Green-to-Red move.

The previous day close is a powerful level of support or resistance and traders should trade toward it when there is rising volume.

If the price is lower than the previous day close (for stocks that gapped down), the market is moving from a Red day to a Green day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be positive, which will be shown as green in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Red-to-Green move.

After a weak Open, the price held below VWAP. I went short, but there was no nearby support or resistance level except the previous day close at $46.52 (the dashed line on my chart). Therefore, I decided to go short from VWAP at around $47.80 for the profit target of the previous day close at $46.52, a nice $1.20 per share profit.

If a stock moves toward the previous day close with high volume, I consider going long with the profit target of the previous day close.

My stop loss is the nearest technical level. If I buy near VWAP, my stop loss will be the break of VWAP. If I buy near a moving average or an important support level, my stop loss will be the break of moving average or support level.

I usually sell all at the profit target. If the price moves in my favor, I bring my stop loss to the break-even and do not let the price turn against me. Red-to-Green moves should work immediately.

Typically, you want to give the opening range at least five minutes. This is called the 5-minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB). Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers.

Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers. They then develop a trade plan in the direction of the 30-minute or 60-minute breakout. In the past, I only traded the trade at the 5-minute ORB, but recently I am more in favor of the 15-minute ORB or the 30-minute ORB. The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range.

The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range. As with most setups, the ORB Strategy tends to work best with mid to large cap stocks, which do not show wild price swings intraday.

Ideally, the stock should trade within a range which is smaller than the Average True Range of the stock (ATR).

For me, stop loss is always a close above VWAP for short positions, and a break below VWAP for long positions.

As I have mentioned, you need the opening range to be smaller than the daily ATR. If a stock moves near or higher than its ATR at the Open, it is not a good candidate for the ORB Strategy. It means that the stock is too volatile and without a catchable move. It is worth mentioning again, Stocks in Play move, and those moves are directional and catchable. If a stock constantly moves up and down $2 with high volume, but without any directional signal, you want to stay away from it. Those stocks are usually being heavily traded by computers.

For example, if its price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness, and you should consider selling if you are long. If you are short and if the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and you may want to cover your short position.

I prefer stocks that have high volume, but also with numerous different orders being traded.

Volume alone does not show the liquidity; the number of orders being sent to the Exchange is as important.

If there was no obvious technical level for the exit and profit target, I exit when a stock shows signs of weakness (if I am long) or strength (if I am short).

For example, if the price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness and I consider selling my position if I am long. If I am short and the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and I consider covering my short position.

You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

I might not be comfortable with a $500 loss, but someone who has a large account can easily hold onto the loss and eventually make profit out of a losing trade. You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

Day trading is not mechanical and automated; it is discretionary: traders need to make real time decisions. The success of each strategy is based on judgment and the proper execution of it by the trader.

I don’t think that having more indicators on your chart helps you in day trading, especially since you need to be able to process information very quickly, at times in just a matter of seconds. I have found that often indicators’ signals will also contradict each other and that will lead to confusion.

For my swing trading, I use more complicated indicators such as MACD because I do not have to make quick decisions. I usually review my swing trading after the market closes, with proper due diligence and evaluation. You can easily find more information about the indicators I’ve mentioned in this section, along with many others, by doing a simple online search.

When you set up a system for trading that has no input or requires no decisions by the trader, then you are entering the world of algorithmic trading, and you will lose trades to investment banks that have million-dollar algorithms and billions of dollars in cash for trading.

I don't expect everything I do to work exactly the same for you. I am happy to help you develop a strategy that is going to work for you, your personality, your account size and your risk tolerance.

The key for now is that you master one strategy. Once you can tread water in the market with your one strategy, you can be a trader without blowing up your account. This is simply a matter of spending time in the chair. The more time you spend watching your charts, the more you will learn.

It is absolutely critical for every trader to be trading a strategy. Plan a trade, and trade the plan. I wish someone had said to me when I first started training, “Andrew, you need to trade a strategy. If you're trading with real money, you must be trading a written strategy, and it must have historical data to verify that it’s worth trading with real money.” You cannot change your plan once you have already entered the trade and have an open position.

The truth about traders is that they fail. They lose money, and a large percentage of those traders are not gaining the education that you are receiving from reading this book.

You may practice three months in a simulator, and then trade small size with real money for one month, and then go back to the simulator to work on your mistakes or practice new strategies for another three months. There is no shame in going back to a simulator at any stage of your day trading career.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day. Accordingly, should I decide to trade during the Mid-day, I lower my share size and keep my stops tight.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day. At times, good trading, and smart trading, is to not be trading at all.

Watch the stocks, prepare for the Close, and be very, very careful with any trading you do.

Reversal, VWAP, Moving Average, and Support or Resistance trades tend to be the best strategies for the Mid-day. I never trade Bull Flag Momentum in Mid-day or at the Close.

If the stock is moving higher in the last hour, it means the professionals are probably bullish on that stock. If the stock is moving lower in the last hour, the market professionals are probably bearish. It is thus a good idea to trade with the professionals and not against them.

VWAP, Support or Resistance, and Moving Average trades tend to be the best strategies for the Close.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them. I created a rule for myself. I am not allowed to lose more than 30% of what I have made in the Open during Mid-day and the Close. If I lose more than the allowed 30%, then I either stop trading or start trading in a simulator.

(which meant the stock on average moves in a range as large as $1.86 during the day).

I looked at the chart and decided to wait and see the price action for the first ten minutes of trading.

My philosophy in trading is that you need to master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method consisting of a few minimal setups will help to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is truly what separates the winners from the losers.

Now that you have learned the basics of a few trading strategies, let’s review the actual process of planning and making a trade.

You now understand the setup you want to trade, but as a beginner trader, you will have a hard time planning and initiating a trade beforehand.

I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, so I firmly believe in the process approach to trading.

My trading process looks like this: Morning routine Develop my watchlist Organize a trade plan Initiate the trade according to plan Execute the trade according to plan Journaling and reflection.

Everyone can read this book or dozens of other books, but only a few people have the discipline to execute correctly. You might have a good setup but select a wrong stock to trade, such as a stock that is being manipulated by computers and institutional traders. Perhaps you will find a proper stock to trade, but you will enter the trade at the wrong time. A bad entry will make a mess of your plan and you will eventually lose your money. You can find a good stock to trade and enter a trade correctly, but if you don’t exit properly, you will turn a winning trade into a losing one. All of the steps of the process are important.

Think about something significant that you do frequently in your life, and then think of how it can best be done. Now, consider how you do it currently. This is a great thought process for traders to have.

Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.

There are scientific studies showing that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on the decision making process.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping body, and thus mind, in their peak operating condition. I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, and I have stopped eating animal-based food, and my performance levels have increased significantly.

Wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I.

I wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I think this is a chicken and egg problem with no real answer, but I believe it is the latter.

If you have always wanted to be in better physical shape, try adding exercises such as running into your routine, and also take control of your salt and sugar intake. If you drink too much alcohol or coffee, try to see if for one month you can stay away from them. These are excellent tests to see if you are emotionally and intellectually strong enough or not to discipline yourself in the face of a losing trade.

Change is hard, but if you wish to be a successful trader, you need to work on changing and developing your personality at every level.

Often traders who fail to make money in trading get frustrated and go out and study more about the market to learn new strategies and additional technical indicators. They don’t realize that their lack of self-discipline, impulsive behavior and their bad life habits are the main cause of their failure, not their technical knowledge.

You have to find one strategy that suits your personality and practice it in your simulator, and then practice it some more. And then you have to stick to it. Like glue.

You also have to have settled in your mind, again, in advance, how much you can afford to risk on any one trade.

Day trading requires a certain mindset, as well as a discipline and a set of skills that not everyone possesses. Interestingly, most of the traders I know are also poker players.

Move to a real account only after at least three months of training with a simulated account and then, start small, with real money. Trade small while you’re learning or when you are feeling stressed. If you wish, you can always have a chat with me in our chatroom and receive some advice and guidance.

Remember, baby steps.

Master one topic, and then and only then move on to the next.

Most traders struggle when they first begin, and many do not have sufficient time in the morning to practice in real time. Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months.

Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months. After four months of paper trading, you need at least another three months of trading in small share size to master your emotions and practice self-discipline while trading with your real money.

After six months, you may become a seasoned trader. Eight months is probably better than six months, and twelve months is perhaps better than both.

Many traders think of inspiring goals such as making a million dollars or being able to trade for a living from a beach house in the Caribbean.

A good trading day is a day when you are disciplined and you trade sound strategies.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult. The best swing traders can expect an annual return of 20% on their account size. Day traders, on the other hand, look to profit between 0.5-1% of their account size daily.

Learn as much as you can, but keep a degree of healthy skepticism about everything, including this book.

Amateurs, on the other hand, are focused on making money every single day.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money,.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money, especially when smaller share sizes are involved.

Your goal is to develop trading skills and not to make money. You must focus on getting better every single day, one trade after another. That is How to Day Trade for a Living . Push your comfort zone to find greater success.

“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”.

Review daily charts and identify important levels of support or resistance. I do not make a trade unless I know the average volume, Average True Range, important technical levels, short interest, and fresh news for the Stocks in Play.

Each day, traders shouldn’t choose more than two or three of these stocks to focus on.

Most professional traders do not arrive later than 7:30 a.m. New York time. Certainly experienced traders with a strong community and powerful scanners can stroll in later, but 9 a.m. is the latest that most serious traders arrive.

Every trade is a new puzzle that you must solve.

Before making a trade, you must create a plan for your trades or a series of “ if-then ” statements. Develop some plans as to when you might take a position in one of your stocks on your watchlist. If you see the x scenario, then you will buy at this price. Continue creating “if-then” scenarios for each outcome.

If the price cannot push higher than VWAP in the first fifteen minutes of the market Open, then I will go short until the previous day close of $48.10.

If the price does sell off to the previous day close of $48.10, then I will go long and ride the reversal to the VWAP.

If the price pushes over VWAP with high volume, then I will go long and ride the momentum to sell at the next resistance level of $53.25.

If the price breaks over the daily level of $53.25, then I will go long again until the daily level of $55.50 (which is not shown on the above Figure 9.2).

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers?.

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers? What technical levels are most important? Is this stock stronger or weaker than the market? Where is most of the volume being traded? At the VWAP? Or the first five minutes? Or near moving averages? How much volume at a price causes the stock to move up or down? What is the bid-ask spread? Is it tradeable? How quickly does the stock move? Is it being traded smoothly or is it choppy, jumping up and down with every trade? Is the stock trading in a particular pattern on a 5-minute chart? How is the stock being traded on a 1-minute chart? These are some of the questions that I ask myself and then answer before trading a stock. All of this information should be gathered before you make any trade. This is what we mean by hard work. As you can see, day trading is an intense intellectual pursuit which requires hard work. Remember Rule 2?.

Turning off the PC early after a few bad trades is a strategy that should be reserved for the rare occasions when it is absolutely essential to give your brain a break. Usually, spending some time in a simulator after some losses will clear your mind sufficiently. Novice traders using a simulator should keep on trading and practicing until the Close. After all, trading in the simulator is not nearly as stressful as real trading with real money. Using a simulator with no commission and no P&L is still no excuse for overtrading. At all times the focus must be on sound strategies with excellent risk/reward opportunities.

Discipline is executing your detailed plan every single time. If your plan is to buy a stock at VWAP and your stop loss is if it fails to hold VWAP, then you must accept the loss immediately and get out of the trade if the stock fails to hold the VWAP.

The market does not reward stubbornness.

Do not judge your trading strategy based upon one trade. Executing your plan, and being disciplined, will lead to long-term success. Many times your plan will be fine and solid but a hedge fund manager out of nowhere will decide to liquidate a position in a stock that you are trading, the price will drop suddenly and you will get stopped out.

A professional trader accepts the loss and gets out of the trade. You then re-evaluate and plan another if-then scenario. You can always get back into the stock. Commissions are cheap (for most of the brokers), and professionals often take several quick stabs at a trade before it will start running in their favor.

Trading teaches you a great deal about yourself, about your mental weaknesses and about your strengths. This alone ensures that trading is a valuable life experience.

“ There is no question in my mind that, if I were to start trading full-time, knowing what I know now, I would either join a proprietary trading firm or would form my own “virtual trading group” by connecting online (and in real time) with a handful of like-minded traders.

Make sure to include the following points in your trading journal: Your physical well-being (lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much food the night before, etc.) The time of the day you made the trade The strategy you were anticipating How you found the opportunity (from a scanner, a chatroom, etc.) Quality of your entry (risk/reward) Sizing/management of your trade (scaling in and out as planned) Execution of exits (following profit targets or stop losses) I personally take a screenshot from my screen (with a free software called Screenshot Captor ) and journal my trades in my blog with that software. Please visit my blog to get some ideas on how to journal your trades. You do not have to follow my style, but you should find what works best for you because to be successful, you must journal your trades daily.

One Good Trade that the professional traders at his firm video-record all of their trades during the day.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively. The next month, you should focus on Moving Average Trend trades.

When you first begin, you must focus on the process of trading, not on how to make money for a living. You must allow at least eight to twelve months before you will become consistently profitable.

If we stubbornly insist on trying to prove to the market that we are right, we will pay a high price.

If you are passionate about trading and never try it, then you will live your life wondering what might have been.


# Furiously Happy (Jenny Lawson)

The great thing about this cover is that when you’re holding the book up to read it, it will look like the bottom of your face has been replaced with an ecstatic raccoon smile. That way you look friendly and also terrifying to anyone passing by, which is nice because then people won’t bother you while you’re reading.

Everyone has human heads in their closet. Sometimes the heads are secrets, or unsaid confessions, or quiet fears. This book is one of those severed heads.

So if you don’t like the book then maybe you’re just not crazy enough to enjoy it. Either way, you win.

“Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall—rain, assholes, and assorted bullshit.”.

My grandmother used to say, “Into everyone’s life a little rain must fall—rain, assholes, and assorted bullshit.” I’m paraphrasing. But she was right. We all get our share of tragedy or insanity or drama, but what we do with that horror is what makes all the difference.

Clinical depression is a semiregular visitor and anxiety disorder is my long-term abusive boyfriend.

Angry because I had no other emotions left to give.

I’ve HAD IT. I AM GOING TO BE FURIOUSLY HAPPY, OUT OF SHEER SPITE.

Can you hear that? That’s me smiling, y’all. I’m smiling so loud you can fucking hear it. I’m going to destroy the goddamn universe with my irrational joy and I will spew forth pictures of clumsy kittens and baby puppies adopted by raccoons and MOTHERFUCKING NEWBORN LLAMAS DIPPED IN GLITTER AND THE BLOOD OF SEXY VAMPIRES AND IT’S GOING TO BE AWESOME. In fact, I’m starting a whole movement right now. The FURIOUSLY HAPPY movement. And it’s going to be awesome because first of all, we’re all going to be VEHEMENTLY happy, and secondly because it will freak the shit out of everyone that hates you because those assholes don’t want to see you even vaguely amused, much less furiously happy, and it will make their world turn a little sideways and will probably scare the shit out of them. Which will make you even more happy. Legitimately. Then the world tips in our favor. Us: 1. Assholes: 8,000,000. That score doesn’t look as satisfying as it should because they have a bit of a head start. Except you know what? Fuck that. We’re starting from scratch.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder that no one understands. Imagine having a dangerous affliction that even you can’t control or suppress. Imagine all the people living life in peace. Imagine the estate of John Lennon not suing me for using that last line.

Imagine having a disease so overwhelming that your mind causes you to want to murder yourself. Imagine having a malignant disorder that no one understands. Imagine having a dangerous affliction that even you can’t control or suppress. Imagine all the people living life in peace. Imagine the estate of John Lennon not suing me for using that last line. Then imagine that same (often fatal) disease being one of the most misunderstood disorders … one that so few want to talk about and one that so many of us can never completely escape from.

I’ve often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that “normal” people also might never understand, and that’s what FURIOUSLY HAPPY is all about. It’s about taking those moments when things are fine and making them amazing, because those moments are what make us who we are, and they’re the same moments we take into battle with us when our brains declare war on our very existence. It’s the difference between “surviving life” and “living life.” It’s the difference between “taking a shower” and “teaching your monkey butler how to shampoo your hair.” It’s the difference between being “sane” and being “furiously happy.”.

And that would be ridiculous because no one would invite a herd of kangaroos into their house. Two is the limit.

I want this book to help people fighting with mental illness, and also those who have friends and family who are affected by it. I want to show people that there can be advantages to being “a bit touched,” as my grandmother put it. I want my daughter to understand what’s wrong with me and what’s right with me. I want to give hope. I want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, but without selling any Coca-Cola products.


# Classic Computer Science Problems in Python (David Kopec)

It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, trying to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more varied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.

In a world full of halfhearted online tutorials, I think it is important to support the development of books that provide the same author’s voice throughout an extended volume.

If you are one of those programmers who knows Python but does not know CS, this book is for you.

Some say that computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. If that’s the case, then perhaps a programming language.

Some say that computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. If that’s the case, then perhaps a programming language is like a telescope lens. In any event, the term “classic computer science problems” is used here to mean “programming problems typically taught in an undergraduate computer science curriculum.”.

A reader with zero programming experience will get little out of this book, and a programmer with zero Python experience will almost certainly struggle.

Every code listing in this book makes use of Python type hints, also known as type annotations. These annotations are a relatively new feature for the Python language, and they may look intimidating to Python programmers who have never seen them before. They are used for three reasons:.

The goal is to teach problem-solving techniques from first principles, not to “pip install a solution.”.


# Advanced Techniques in Day Trading: A Practical Guide to High Probability Day Trading Strategies and Methods (Andrew Aziz)

Work on simple and well-known strategies, but adjust them over time to complement your own personality and whatever the current market conditions are. Success in trading is not a revolution; it is an evolution.

Simply reading books will, of course, not make you a profitable trader. Profits in trading do not come from reading one or two, or even a dozen books, but, as I explain, profits can come with practice, the right tools and software, and proper ongoing education.

There are many firms, educators, traders and even online scammers who develop these types of computer programs and systems and sell them to traders.

However, because the discretionary trader must make a decision for each trade, traders are more prone to emotional trading and acts of self-deception, such as falling in love with a trade, that will often result in a failure to follow their trading plan.

I'm always saying that trading is a career and a business. And in no career and in no business can you become profitable in just three months. Look at doctors, lawyers and engineers. They go to school for years and take examinations and serve internships and practice, and practice some more, before they can truly call themselves professionals. They are all long and challenging processes that take considerably more than three months.

Typical education cost for a trader is between $1,000 to $2,000 including several months of practice trading in a simulator.

An education or training program is an investment that you make, and maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. If it doesn't, it's not the end of the world for you.

Knowing how to manage expectations is extremely important, especially for beginner traders.

My desire is to try to save traders from themselves.

When our ancestors originally studied the sky above them, they saw what appeared to be a random mass of stars. As they continued.

This means that recognizing trade patterns is important, but execution is equally important.

This is the confusing part for many people. They do not know how to accept a loss, but they still believe the fact that making money in the market is possible.

There is never any money to be made in the obvious conclusions.

Some of the skills to be learned include building a watchlist, finding the Stocks in Play (finding the correct stocks to trade), identifying and practicing strategies, finding patterns, and learning about positions.

Many famous traders say trading is 80% psychology and 20% technical knowledge.

As Dr. Alexander Elder writes in his book, Trading for a Living, successful traders watch their trades and their money as carefully as professional scuba divers watch their.

As Dr. Alexander Elder writes in his book, Trading for a Living, successful traders watch their trades and their money as carefully as professional scuba divers watch their supply of air.

You have to be significantly above the crowd to win in day trading. Trading is a minus-sum game. Just by entering into the market, you start losing. Your bank charges you a fee for wiring out to fund your trading account. Your broker will charge you an incoming wiring fee for funding the account and then start charging you for their market data, the use of their platform and a commission on each trade that you make. If you do not make enough monthly commissions for them, they will then charge you an inactivity fee.

Day trading is not a hobby. It’s not a weekend pursuit.

Personally believe you must start developing the discipline of a winner. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You have to be “calm, cool and collected” as the saying goes. You have to somehow find a way to control your emotions.

While risk-taking in trading needs to be carefully and rationally managed, an excessive avoidance of risk can be a major roadblock to success.

Greed is probably a more common occupational hazard in trading, especially among novice traders.

My trading career has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Resilience is one of the greatest psychoanalytic puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct. To get the exact answer, we have to look more deeply into the human psyche.

Why do some people experience real hardships but do not lose their strength?.

People react very differently to challenges in life. In 1983, a talented young guitarist, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of his newly formed band in the worst possible way. The band had just been signed to a record deal to record their first album. But a couple of days before the recording was to begin, without any warning, discussion, or a dramatic blowout, the band asked Dave to leave. He had to go back to his hometown the same day. He sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York and kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now? By the time the bus hit L.A., Dave had gotten over this bad experience and self-pity and vowed to start a new band. He decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision. He worked hard, he spent months recruiting the best musicians he could find, he wrote dozens of songs, and he practiced religiously. The combination of anger and ambition eventually led him to form the legendary heavy metal band Megadeth which sold 38 million plus albums and toured the world many times over. Today, Dave Mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavy metal music. The band Dave was fired from was Metallica, one of the best-selling bands ever. Although he never reached the same success as Metallica, he did put his life back on track. This is resilience at work.

Resilience is something you realize you have after the fact.

I recently watched a movie on Netflix, The Founder, about the life of the legendary Roy Kroc, the middle-aged and below average milkshake salesperson who began to build the McDonald’s empire at the age of.

“Now, I know what you're thinkin'. How the heck does a 52-year-old, over-the-hill milkshake machine salesman... build a fast food empire with 16,000 restaurants, in 50 states, in 5 foreign countries... with an annual revenue of in the neighborhood of $700,000,000.00... “One word... PERSISTENCE. “Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.”.

.

The first window is the Top List, which has six columns, with the first three columns for Nasdaq highest volume, highest gainers and highest losers.

Price action in the form of white/red candlesticks Volume of shares being traded and average volume line 9 Exponential Moving Average of price (9 EMA) and 20 Exponential Moving Average of price (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average of price (50 SMA) and 200 Simple Moving Average of price (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price Last sale price.

VWAP lets you know if the buyers or the sellers are in control of the price action.

Level 2 is known to be a “leading indicator”, which means it shows activity before a trade happens. Moving averages, charts and most of the other indicators are known as “lagging indicators”, meaning they provide information after the trades take place.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5 cents and your upside is 25 cents, or your downside is 20 cents and your upside is one dollar. That’s 1:5.

A Stock in Play that is about to trade higher or lower from its present price. Stocks in Play move, and their moves are predictable and frequent and catchable. A good intraday stock offers numerous and excellent risk/reward opportunities. Every day, there are new stocks that are in play. Trading Stocks in Play allow you to be the most efficient with your buying power. They often offer much better risk/reward opportunities intraday and allow you to execute your ideas and trading rules with more consistency. Trading the right Stocks in Play can help you to combat algorithmic programs. What are Stocks in Play? They could be, in no particular order: A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off You need to keep in mind that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume. Some stocks like Apple Inc. (ticker: AAPL) will on average trade millions and millions of shares each day, while other stocks on average might trade only 500,000 shares each day. Does this mean you should trade AAPL only? No. High volume will be relative from one stock to another. You don’t look just for high total volume. There are some stocks that regularly trade with high volume. What.

What are Stocks in Play? They could be, in no particular order: A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off.

If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing. When the market is weak, it means that the majority of stocks are selling off. It does not matter if it is Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Exxon Mobil. When the market is strong, the prices of the majority of stocks will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume independent of the overall market are referred to as Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are being traded independently of their sector and the overall market.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play - high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

Based on my experience, trading and losing on low float stocks is the number one reason new traders blow up their accounts.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2% Stocks that have traded at least 100,000 shares by 9 a.m. in the pre-market Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares Stocks that have Average True Range (ATR) of at least 50 cents (how much of a range a stock has on average every day) There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

High volume with no volatility in the pre-market is often a sign of “buyout” news. This means ALR has been acquired at an agreed price and although it has gapped up, there will be no trading opportunity during the day.

Buyout gaps are very common in the market, but remember, they are not tradeable. When a company acquires another company, the price is determined and usually there will be no volatility in the price for you to trade on.

This large transaction is called a “block trade”. A block trade, also known as a block order, is an order or trade submitted for the sale or purchase of a large quantity of shares being traded at an arranged price between two parties, sometimes outside of the open markets, to lessen the impact on the price of the stock.

I am often asked by new traders how to make a Gappers watchlist if they do not have a Trade Ideas scanner. In that case, you can make use of one of the free scanners available on the Internet such as www.finviz.com. The DAS platform also has a basic scanner built into it for free use by its subscribers, but it does not allow you to filter and define more sophisticated scanners by changing parameters such as ATR or float. If you have the DAS platform, many of the Gappers watchlist stocks will often also hit the Top List window. For example, Figure 3.13 shows my Gappers watchlist on October 25, 2017 next to my Top List window for that day. As you can see, many Gappers watchlist candidates are actually on the Top List as well, as I marked.

Review the price action of the candidates on both 5-minute and daily charts and look for decent pre-market activity.

A good pre-market activity is relative, but a uniform volume on the pre-market and clean price action on the 5-minute chart is important. Having gradual moves to the upside or downside, establishing clear pre-market levels, and respecting VWAP and moving averages are sufficiently clean price action for me.

This is how I find in real time the low float stocks that are making new highs of the day that meet the following filter criteria: Price range: $1 to $10 The volume today is at least 200,000 shares The float is a maximum of 10,000,000 shares The volume in the last 5 minutes is between 400% and 2,000% of normal The current volume is at least 2 times the normal average volume The 15-minute range is at least $0.30.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traditionally, RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a stock is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore may be prime for a reversal or pull back. On the other hand, an RSI reading of 30 or below can indicate an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal.

On the other hand, an RSI reading of 30 or below can indicate an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal to the upside.

I set my RSI Extreme Scanner in a way that only shows stocks which are entering an extreme range of either above 90 or below 10 within a 5–minute time frame.

I have found that almost all of the stocks which hit my RSI Extreme Scanner during the day are Stocks in Play. I may not necessarily trade them all, but they often do provide good trading opportunities.

If you overtrade, your broker will become richer, and you will become, well, broker! Remember, your goal is to trade well, not to trade often.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

Support and resistance levels are very important reference points because so many traders recognize them and believe in their significance. It’s herd mentality 101.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days. I use a tool called PriceMarker, which is referred to as a Study in my DAS platform, to automatically put four levels on my chart for any stock that I am watching.

Previous day close plus yesterday’s high, yesterday’s low, two days ago high and two days ago low. These are very, very important to support and resistance.

Stocks in Play often have clean pre-market activity, and that is one of my important criteria for shortlisting the Gappers for my final watchlist.

Two powerful levels for day traders are the high and the low of the pre-market activity.

Moving averages on higher time frames such as daily charts and 5-minute charts are important support and resistance levels, especially the larger moving averages such as 50 SMA and 200 SMA.

Please note that as a rule of thumb, the higher the time frame and the higher the moving averages are, the stronger the support and resistance levels will be. A 200 SMA on a daily chart is perhaps the strongest support and resistance level. Moving averages on 1-minute charts on the other hand tend to be less strong.

Daily chart >> 5-minute chart >> 1-minute chart 200 SMA >> 50 SMA >> 20 EMA >> 9 EMA.

A large wick to the upside or downside on a daily chart will immediately catch my attention.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value. Sometimes it is not clear which line is the optimum line, and in those situations all you can do is just draw the best that you can.

For day trading, it is better to draw support and resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support and resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. Swing traders often ignore those wicks on daily charts. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on.

Support and resistance lines on daily charts are not always easy to find, and at times you will not be able to draw anything clear. If I cannot see anything clear, I don’t have to draw anything. There is a good chance that other traders will also not see those lines clearly and therefore there is no point in forcing myself to draw support and resistance lines. In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or moving averages or other levels that I earlier discussed.


# The Quick Python Book, Third Edition (Naomi Ceder)

I’ve come to use Python just to help myself think about a problem more clearly.

The fact that Python associates types with objects and not with variables means that the interpreter doesn’t help you catch variable type mismatches.

In the past decade the numbers and types of mobile devices have exploded, and smartphones, tablets, phablets, Chromebooks, and more are everywhere, running on a variety of operating systems. Python isn’t a strong player in this space. While options exist, running Python on mobile devices isn’t always easy, and using Python to write and distribute commercial apps is problematic.

# Pro Git (Scott Chacon;Ben Straub)

When you’re done, you may feel the need to spend a quiet moment pondering how you lived before Git branching was part of your life.

If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

By default Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with git init.

Your default branch name.


# Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series) (Zed A. Shaw)

Attention to Detail The one skill that separates good programmers from bad programmers is attention to detail. In fact, it’s what separates the good from the bad in any profession.

Programmer will eventually tell you to use macOS or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they’ll tell you to get a macOS computer. If he likes control and has a huge beard, he will (or ze will if you prefer non-gendered pronouns for humans with beards) tell you to install Linux.

If you try to use Vim and don’t know how to quit, then type :q! or ZZ. If someone told you to use Vim, and they didn’t even tell you this, then now you know why you shouldn’t listen to them.

# Fluent Python, 2nd Edition (Luciano Ramalho)

However, if you learned another object-oriented language before Python, you may find it strange to use len(collection) instead of collection.len(). This apparent oddity is the tip of an iceberg that, when properly understood, is the key to everything we call Pythonic.

The special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores (i.e.,.


# Fundamental Chess Openings (Paul van der Sterren)

As long as chess is alive, its opening theory will also be alive and new books will be needed to document all of this new life.

In space, you don’t really fly. You just don’t fall.

Under extreme g-forces, I felt like I’d aged a hundred years in a second.


# Price Action Breakdown: Exclusive Price Action Trading Approach to Financial Markets (Laurentiu Damir)

You will stop fishing for the magic indicator or some sort of automated program that will do all the trading for you and provide good returns.

I do not recommend trading a timeframe lower than a zoomed out five minutes one because it will expose you to the daily trading noise and random movements, to the point where your trading will start to resemble gambling.

If you have read something of mine in the past you know that I do not recommend using technical indicators in your trading as they are all constructed on past price action that you can see with your naked eye on the chart. They are all lagging. The best indicator you can have is your brain analyzing the raw price movements.

The type of trading that will be discussed is based on the underlying forces that make the price of any particular financial instrument move up or down. That is supply and demand and crowd behavior.

The techniques you will learn are based solely on reading the price action on the naked chart in front of you, with the main purpose of discovering what are the buyers and seller doing, and what are they most likely to do next.

The price movements on any financial market have one common denominator. Crowd behavior. This crowd consists of people who buy and people who sell. The selling and buying process is what creates the price movements you see on any chart.

# Reminiscences of a Stock Operator Illustrated (Edwin Lef?vre)

There are times when every market has a story to tell.

There are times when every market has a story to tell. And you have to train yourself to be both a great observer and listener, or you will be too late to enjoy the full story that will be told.

As I was reading it again for umpteenth time, I noticed on page three it reads that Livingston used to journal both “the determination of (probable price) movements” as well as “assorted record of my hits and misses.”.

It is a textbook for speculation.

He had made and lost more fortunes by the age of 25 than most people will see in a lifetime,.

Panache of an artful storyteller rather than with the scolding finger of a professor,.

Through the voice of the Livingston character, Lefevre reaches out through time to remind us, with the panache of an artful storyteller rather than with the scolding finger of a professor, that there never is anything new on Wall Street, because speculation is as old as the hills; that in a bull market you must trade with the bulls, while in a bear market you must trade with the bears; that anticipation and fast reaction are the trader’s key assets; that you should never argue with the tape; that you do not know until you bet; that the game teaches you the game; and much more.

Human nature condemns virtually everyone to being a sucker.

“Things have been bad with me. I am tired of fighting. Can’t carry on any longer. This is the only way out.”.
