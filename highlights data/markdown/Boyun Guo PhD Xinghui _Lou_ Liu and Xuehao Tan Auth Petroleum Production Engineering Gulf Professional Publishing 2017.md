Most oil reservoirs are of the volumetric type where the driving mechanism is the expansion of solution gas when reservoir pressure declines because of fluid production.

Obtain a high production rate of a well is to increase production pressure drawdown by reducing the bottom-hole pressure with artificial lift methods.

Beam pumping.”.

Provides mechanical energy to lift oil from bottom-hole to surface. It is efficient, simple, and easy for field people to operate. It can pump a well down to very low pressure to maximize oil production rate. It is applicable to slim holes, multiple completions, and high-temperature and viscous oils. The system is also easy to change to other wells with minimum cost. The major disadvantages of beam pumping include excessive friction in crooked/deviated holes, solid-sensitive problems, low efficiency in gassy wells, limited depth due to rod capacity, and bulky in offshore operations. Beam pumping trends include improved pump-off controllers, better gas separation, gas handling pumps, and optimization using surface and bottomhole cards.

Volumetric efficiency can decrease significantly due to the presence of free gas below the plunger.

As the fluid is elevated and gas breaks out of solution, there is a significant difference between the volumetric displacement of the bottom-hole pump and the volume of the fluid delivered to the surface. This effect is denoted by the shrinkage factor greater than 1.0, indicating that the bottom-hole pump must displace more fluid by some additional percentage than the volume delivered to the surface (Brown, 1980). The effect of gas on volumetric efficiency depends on solutiongas ratio and bottom-hole pressure.Down-hole devices, called “gas anchors,” are usually installed on pumps to separate the gas from the liquid.
