Promise if you’ll just let me speak with you, I won’t take more than five minutes of your time.".

"I am a human being," she would always say, "therefore nothing human is alien to me.".

Why we can all be stirred when the caged bird sings.

The truth of the statement was like a wadded up handkerchief, sopping wet in my fists, and the sooner they accepted it the quicker I could let my hands open and the air would cool my palms.

But I had seen the fingers cut by the mean little cotton bolls, and I had witnessed the backs and shoulders and arms and legs resisting any further demands.

Winced to picture them sewing the coarse material under a coal-oil lamp with fingers stiffening from the day's work.

Then they would face another day of trying to earn enough for the whole year with the heavy knowledge that they were going to end the season as they started it.

Like most children, I thought if I could face the worst danger voluntarily, and triumph, I would forever have power over it.

During these years in Stamps, I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare. He was my first white love.

Pacified myself about his whiteness by saying that after all he had been dead so long it couldn't matter to anyone any more.

For every bad judgment, the fine was no silver-wrapped Kisses, the sweet chocolate drops that I loved more than anything in the world, except Bailey.

Momma used the juice to make almost-black fruit cakes. Then she lined heavy soot-encrusted iron skillets with the pineapple rings for rich upside-down cakes. Bailey and I received one slice each, and I carried mine around for hours, shredding off the fruit until nothing was left except the perfume on my fingers.

It seemed that the peace of a day's ending was an assurance that the covenant God made with children, Negroes and the crippled was still in effect.

How great it would be to grow up like that, to be able to stare religion down, especially living next door to a woman like Momma.

When I was described by our playmates as being shit color, he was lauded for his velvet-black skin.

Bailey was the greatest person in my world. And the fact that he was my brother, my only brother, and I had no sisters to share him with, was such good fortune that it made me want to live a Christian life just to show God that I was grateful. Where I was big, elbowy and grating, he was small, graceful and smooth. When I was described by our playmates as being shit color, he was lauded for his velvet-black skin.

When our elders said unkind things about my features (my family was handsome to a point of pain for me), Bailey would wink at me from across the room, and I knew that it was a matter of time before he would take revenge. He would allow the old ladies to finish wondering how on earth I came about, then he would ask, in a voice like cooling bacon grease, “Oh Mizeriz Coleman, how is your son? I saw him the other day, and he looked sick enough to die.” Aghast, the ladies would ask, “Die? From what? He ain't sick.” And in a voice oilier than the one before, he'd answer with a straight face, “From the Uglies.”.

Top, spinning, falling, laughing, finally stopping just before my heart beat its last, and then he was back in the game, still laughing. Of.

Of all the needs (there are none imaginary) a lonely child has, the one that must be satisfied, if there is going to be hope and a hope of wholeness, is the unshaking need for an unshakable God. My pretty Black brother was my Kingdom Come.

People in Stamps used to say that the whites in our town were so prejudiced that a Negro couldn't buy vanilla ice cream. Except on July Fourth. Other days he had to be satisfied with chocolate.

Whatever was given by Black people to other Blacks was most probably needed as desperately by the donor as by the receiver. A fact which made the giving or receiving a rich exchange.

Of course, I knew God was white too, but no one could have made me believe he was prejudiced.

Her smile widened her mouth beyond her cheeks beyond her ears and seemingly through the walls to the street outside.

It would have been near impossible to maintain formality under a small town's invasions of privacy.

“Ritie, don't worry 'cause you ain't pretty. Plenty pretty women I seen digging ditches or worse. You smart. I swear to God, I rather you have a good mind than a cute behind.”.

When she chose to smile on me, I always wanted to thank her. The action was so graceful and inclusively benign.

She was one of the few gentlewomen I have ever known, and has remained throughout my life the measure of what a human being can be.

Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them.

It went without saying that all girls could iron and wash, but the finer touches around the home, like setting a table with real silver, baking roasts and cooking vegetables without meat, had to be learned elsewhere.

Weekdays revolved on a sameness wheel. They turned into themselves so steadily and inevitably that each seemed to be the original of yesterday's rough draft.

For he was all I claimed, if not all I had.

And—“How can you claim to be my brother, and hate me? Is that Charity? How can you claim to be my sister and despise me? Is that supposed to be Charity? How can you claim to be my friend and misuse and wrongfully abuse me? Is that Charity?.

“If you ask a Negro where he's been, he'll tell you where he's going.”.

“Anything that works against you can also work for you once you.

“Anything that works against you can also work for you once you understand the Principle of Reverse.

“Life is going to give you just what you put in it. Put your whole heart in everything you do, and pray, then you can wait.”.

“hoped for the best, was prepared for the worst, so anything in between didn't come as a surprise.”.
