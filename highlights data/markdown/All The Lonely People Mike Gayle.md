It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams.

It had been almost twenty years since Hubert’s daughter Rose had relocated to Australia and rarely a day went by when he didn’t wish that she lived closer. He’d never say this to her, of course; the last thing he wanted was to prevent her from living her dreams. But there were moments, usually when he least expected, when he felt her absence so intensely he could barely draw breath.

‘Now tell me, girl, why does a fancy, la-di-dah academic like you want to know what a boring old man like me has been doing with his days? You a glutton for punishment?’.

‘Oh, Dad,’ chided Rose, ‘what are you like? You really should take an interest in your friends, you know. They’re good for your health. I came across a very interesting study the other day that said people with a small group of good friends are more likely to live longer.’.

‘Will you give it a try?’ Hubert had his reservations but Rose was someone he simply couldn’t say no to.

‘Hubert,’ she would say, ‘you need to spend less time fixing on the problem and more time working out what you’re going to do about it!’ And as he lay there in bed it occurred to him that she was right. Lying around feeling sorry for himself wasn’t going to sort anything out. What he needed was a solution to his current predicament. A way forward. A plan.

‘He’s been such a good friend to me and me hate the idea of him ending up alone.’.

When you don’t see someone regularly you imagine them carrying on their lives as they’d always done from one year to the next but the truth was things changed.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

People grew old and got sick, they sold up and moved on; they weren’t stuck in aspic waiting for the day that you knocked on their door looking for them.

In fact, soon Hubert began to quantify how good or bad a day was simply by the quality and quantity of interactions he had with Joyce.

Believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce.

But in a short space of time he went from believing that there was no way a girl like Joyce would go out with him to becoming convinced that if he just said the right thing in the right way and looked handsome and debonair while doing it, he might be in with a chance.

‘I’ve got a question for you … What are you doing Saturday night?’ Hubert stared at her confused. ‘Me … me … got no plans.’ ‘Good,’ she replied. ‘In that case you’re taking me to the five o’clock showing of South Pacific at the Regal in Blackfriars.’ Hubert stood frozen to the spot, speechless. A wry smile played on Joyce’s lips. ‘What? You haven’t seen it already, have you?’ Even if he had, twenty times, he would gladly see it twenty times more if it meant going with her. ‘No, me haven’t seen it.’ ‘Good,’ said Joyce. ‘Then I’ll meet you outside the Regal at four thirty so we can chat before the film.’.

He grinned in the lift on the way back down to the warehouse. He grinned as he passed Mr Coulthard yelling at the new lads. And he grinned all the more later when Kenneth told him a very odd story about being sent on a wild-goose chase to the fourth floor by a girl from haberdashery.

‘Of course I do,’ said Ashleigh. ‘And yes, I know sometimes the world’s a horrible place but not always. Sometimes it’s a lovely place where nice things happen for no reason and I’d much rather …’ She began to get upset. ‘… I’d much rather live in that world than the other one!’.

It was a kiss that didn’t so much say goodbye as hello.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy.

As he held her Hubert thought about a Charles Dickens book he had to read at school, A Tale of Two Cities. The tale of a man who gave up his own life for the woman he loved just so that she could be happy. At the time he had thought the idea nonsense – how could the man ever be happy knowing that he’d never be with his girl again? – but in this moment Hubert finally understood the character’s motivation. In this moment he knew that he too would do anything, absolutely anything to prevent his girl from enduring pain no matter what the cost to himself.

‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’.

‘Me tried to read one once,’ confessed Hubert, ‘but me didn’t get very far. Couldn’t make head nor tail of it!’ As Ashleigh flicked through one of the books, Hubert pointed out the dedication inside, which read, ‘To Mum and Dad, who taught me how to think.’ Hubert laughed. ‘That’s the one part of this book me never get tired of reading!’.

‘Me think your daughter will be whatever she wants to be,’.

‘Joyce Anne Pierce, would you do me the honour of being my wife? And not because of the baby, and not because you have nowhere else to go, but because me don’t want to waste another single minute without you.’.

When.

Sajjan: 3284.

The moment it had dawned on him that he wasn’t an island. That, in spite of himself, he missed the company of other human beings. No, he wasn’t really in the mood for cake, company or conversation but he had to acknowledge that this was something he needed, even if it wasn’t necessarily what he wanted.

It was meant to be a thankyou not a death threat.

What is it them always say? It’s the thought that counts.’.

“Sometimes the best way to get to know a new place is to get lost in it.”’.

‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

‘Joyce, you know you can’t pick a fight with everyone who has something to say about us, don’t you?’ ‘I know,’ she whispered in the darkness. ‘There’s too many of them, and not enough hours in the day.’.

Joyce bit her lip. Sometimes she was so ashamed of this country she called home, she could cry.

‘I bet you wish you’d never come sometimes.’ Hubert fell silent, clearly struggling with his answer. ‘If me being honest me do sometimes,’ he said eventually. ‘But then me think about you and Rose, and the wonderful life we’re going to have together and me say to myself, “Hubert Bird, what are you talking about? You is the luckiest man alive.”’.

‘It will be my way of saying thank you to you, Mr Hubert, for your kindness with the pineapple juice.’.

‘If anybody had tried to steal my Joyce on our wedding day, me would’ve boxed them ears!’.

‘The days ain’t half long sometimes when you’re on your own,’.

‘You needn’t look so worried!’ teased Jan. ‘I’m done with romance, Hubert. All I need these days are my soaps, a good murder mystery to curl up with on a rainy day and some quality company every now and again. So what do you say?’.

‘Smiler, you know me, I’m not the settling kind. I don’t like to be boxed in and it felt like everything Lois was doing was about building a great big box to keep me in.’.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom? Gus had been happy with Lois, that was.

Hubert sighed but said nothing. How long and how hard had his friend pursued this woman he’d called a goddess, only to cast her aside for some imagined idea of freedom?.

Gus had spoken about it as if it was a trap but Hubert didn’t feel trapped at all.

Before he knew what he was doing, Hubert was on his feet too, taking Joyce’s hand and holding it tightly in his. As he met the gaze of first Joyce’s father and then each of her brothers, Hubert told himself he was ready for whatever happened next. As far as he was concerned, his wife’s battles were his and that was just the way it was and would always be.

Hubert pulled out his handkerchief and wiped away sweat both real and imaginary.

Though she might not be here any more, Joyce was still his girl.

‘Well, if you’re really not interested in her that way, Hubert, then make sure you’re totally honest with her, because one thing you’ve got to know about us ladies is that we’re eternal optimists!’.

‘Kids,’ she said, spearing a new potato on her fork and dipping it into the salad cream, ‘you raise them the best you can, make all the sacrifices in the world, give them all the love in the universe and all they do is break your heart.’.

The world is moving so fast and no one’s got time to stop these days. It’s sad really. I read a thing in the paper last week while I was having my break at work. Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

‘There are so many lonely people around these days,’ she said. ‘I see it at the vet’s all the time: old dears whose only friend in the world is their pet and who want nothing more than a little chat when they pop in for worming medicine or whatever.

Apparently, loneliness is a bigger killer than cancer. Can you imagine that? There’s a bigger killer than cancer in the world and no one’s doing anything about it.’.

Then, holding the bouquet out over the water, he released his grip and as it fell through the air then finally into the river below, Hubert thought about Joyce, their life together and how, even now, nearly thirteen years on, he still missed her with every fibre of his being.

Distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

With her eyes still closed, she reached over and took his hand and together they listened to the sounds of the children playing, of the sparrows chirping in the holly bush behind them, of the distant chimes of the ice-cream van, and made a wordless agreement never to speak of the matter again.

Sometimes, as his Joyce used to say, instead of waiting around for somebody else to do something, you have to be that person. Sometimes you just have to go big or go home.

How could his two babies both look so grown up when it had only been yesterday that they would crawl into his lap to watch TV? It didn’t seem possible, and yet here he was, about to set one of them on a journey that would take her who knew where? Time seemed to be racing past, the clock ticking two beats for every one, and Hubert sometimes felt like he couldn’t keep up. Before he knew it, David would be leaving too, whether to university as Hubert hoped, or off pursuing dreams of his own, and then it would be just him and Joyce again, like it had been in the early days. But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person.

But that time felt so long ago, it might as well have happened to another person. He wasn’t that young man any more and Joyce wasn’t that young woman. They were different, they were parents and had been for so long now that it was almost impossible to conceive of a life when they were anything else.

It was only when he and Jan were in place that it occurred to Hubert just how nervous he was about facing the general public. After all, it was one thing to pass the time of day with someone, but it was quite another to attempt to recruit them into volunteering their time and commitment.

Some people are like sun. They are admired when they come and when they go. You spend the rest of the time avoiding them, looking for some shade. But some people are like moon. You don't take notice of the time when they come. And like moon, they have an habit of disappearing in the lovely night. Every time they come, they are a little different. They are not the brightest, in fact the shine they carry is not even their own, they only reflect. However, you can spend the entire night fathoming their beauty. And entire day longing their company. Some people are the moon of our life.

‘I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that she’s my baby girl and nobody, not even Prince Charles himself, is going to be good enough for her.’.

‘Well, tough, you shouldn’t have been so greedy and eaten your lunch as a mid-morning snack!’.

There was another long, awkward pause, then Jan said, ‘Hubert, I don’t mean to pry but about earlier … you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to. But I just want you to know that if you need to talk, I’m here to listen.’.

‘I’m Zara, and I’ll be doing your make-up this morning. Not that there’s a lot to do. You have the most amazing skin and cheekbones to die for! Anyway, take a seat and I’ll give you a quick powder.’.

It was the not knowing that was the most painful thing, the hope sometimes as painful as the despair.

‘Me love you from the tips of your toes to the top of your head and what’s more, me always will.’.

‘It’s easy to waste a lot of time trying to think of a perfect solution to a problem. But sometimes the only thing you can do is cross your fingers and have a go.’.

“Smiler, this damn tea so weak it nearly a fortnight!”.

Each time he had been to see Gus before now, he had come wanting something from his friend: the first to renew their friendship for Rose’s sake and the second to find out what had gone so wrong in his old friend’s life. This time around he wanted it to be different: he didn’t want anything from Gus other than to share a meal and remember the old days. Hubert had been prepared to sit in silence while Gus ignored both him and the food. This then was a pleasant surprise, a glimmer of how they used to be and, he hoped, a spark that might reignite the fire of their friendship.

At the time of their wedding, lots of people had doubted whether the marriage would last, the odds being so stacked against them, but what they didn’t know, what they couldn’t know unless they were in Hubert and Joyce’s shoes, was that even though they had been married in a down-at-heel register office in Brixton rather than a fancy church, even though there had been no big wedding party, no lavish gifts, no honeymoon, they had meant every single word of their vows: ‘For better for worse … in sickness and in health, ’til death us do part.’.

One lot break into your house and the other suck the money straight from your bank account!.

She left the room, leaving Hubert to consider the future. No more pantomime with the telephone, no more Rose, no more fooling himself that his life was anything other than what it was: day after day of emptiness. His mind flicked back to that moment with Jan and the kiss they’d shared, a moment that now seemed to belong to another time.

Anyway, avoiding people was easy once you learned how, and with every day that passed it seemed to be getting easier.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’.

Every time I’ve walked past yours I’ve wanted to knock on your door, see how you were doing … but at the same time I wanted to respect your feelings too.’ ‘Me know. And me didn’t exactly make it easy for you and for that me sorry. You of all people didn’t deserve to be shut out like that.’.

Now that she had recovered herself, there was an unmistakable frostiness in her tone.

‘Jan,’ began Hubert, ‘you have every right to be upset. You’ve been nothing but a friend to me and me have behave … well, it can’t have been nice for you.’ ‘You mean worrying about you day and night?’ said Jan. ‘You mean going over and over everything I’d said and done? You mean knocking on your door, calling you, even writing letters only to be completely ignored? No, it wasn’t nice. It wasn’t nice at all.’.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort.

‘Only? What do you mean only? Have you any idea how much you mean to that girl? She thinks the absolute world of you, she does, and I’m not exaggerating. She’s been so worried about you, I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to comfort her.’.

‘Oh, Hubert. Of course it’s possible. I don’t think I could ever be angry with you for any length of time.

‘No, you don’t,’ said Hubert. ‘Until me met you, me hadn’t even given romance a second thought. Why would me do that, when lightning never strikes in the same place twice? But then me got to know you, and me spend time in your company and well … all me can say is that you, Jan, you is a mighty fine woman, and me wish with me whole heart that me could be saying that me want us to be together.

‘Oh Hubert, the important thing is that you don’t have to go through anything alone any more. You’ve got Ashleigh and Layla, you’ve got your friend Gus back on the scene, you’ve got all the committee, and last but not least, you’ve got a friend in me for life, if nothing else.’.

‘You see, the key to helping other people out of them loneliness is nothing more difficult than good old-fashioned perseverance. It’s not always easy, me know that, but you’ve got to be willing to keep doors open, to carry on trying even if it doesn’t look like it’s working. You’ve got to refuse to give up on people, even if them given up on themselves.’ He paused again, reflecting on just how lonely he’d been all those years, how cut off from the rest of the world.

‘And that’s the funny thing about life. Extraordinary things can happen to ordinary people like you and me, but only if we open ourselves up enough to let them.’.

In fact, to choose to continue living was to honour the memory of those he had loved and lost, a celebration of the life they had once shared.
