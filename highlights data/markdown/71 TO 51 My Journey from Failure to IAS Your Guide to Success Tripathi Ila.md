It just might happen that you will find your true calling. Civil Services is not the end of the world. But if your inner self, your best wishers tell you, then don’t self-doubt. It’s a good world waiting for you.

And it was only recently that husband dearest confessed that he waited for that one day rather eagerly.

Tell yourself to be prepared for hard work. You should prepare yourself to sacrifice some pleasure in life like parties, hangouts with friends, social media presence etc.

"Nothing else matters, everything else can wait.".

Books, test series, study place is the minimum requirement.

Below is the booklist which is a must for all aspirants: NCERTs: Geography class VI to XII History (old) for Ancient Art and culture- Fine Arts Class XI Economics- Class XI, XII, Economic Survey (for the respective year in which you're to appear for the exam) Polity- Laxmikanth Geography- G C Leong Modern History- Spectrum Environment- Shankar IAS Academy.

Channelise your focus on reading newspaper. As a starting point, develop a habit of reading one of these two newspapers- the Hindu or the Indian Express. Initially editorials will seem  boring and perhaps difficult to understand. Do not let this bother you. Look out for the term(s) you don't understand and then look them up on the internet. To give you an example, in 2015-16 a term called “import cover” would always feature in the Economy section of newspapers. However, no where did any of the newspapers define import cover. Now it is up to you to take the effort of searching the meaning of the term. I did look it up and the term featured in CSE Prelims 2016.

The key to success is to read few books many times rather than many books few times.

But then as they say, if you want to do what you love, do what you should.

Working out, yoga, meditation, practicing your hobby are also good ways to utilise the spare time i.e. post 10 hours.

A non-failing formula to avoid depression is to keep yourself immersed in studies. An idle mind is a devil's workshop.

For Prelims, I would strongly recommend Vision IAS Full Test Series (not subject-wise) and daily Insight IAS MCQs on current affairs. Also, Previous 5 years questions are a must.

This is important because sheet filling up gives an estimate of word limit. For a 10 marks answer, you must fill up 3 sides of papers.

I would also suggest writing two tests on same day with a break of two hours in between. This is how the actual Mains exam schedule is like. So it builds your stamina and your brain is also trained to think in “those” hours only.

These scores are in no way a replica of marks you would score in the actual exam but certainly guide you in terms of whether your preparation is on the track or not.

The missing quality is that they do not revise.

This exam is not a test of how much you know but how well you can apply what you know. Let us say you know ------------. But what you are actually able to recollect and write in the exam is –-. Then what is the point of knowing so much? The best way to apply what you know is to revise what you have read. Instead of reading 100 books, read only 10 ten books but from cover to cover multiple times.

I remember that I would have revised Laxmikanth 12-13 times before Prelims.

Every time I would read, I would find some new information. This was particularly true for chapter 22 on Parliament. I would recommend solving Vision IAS Polity test papers. They are easily available at Flavido (online) or offline shops in ORN but a little later than their online version. Questions in the actual exam are way easier than them but they are useful in revising.

First read it, then understand it and finally write it down in simpler language without compromising on important details.

For example, if you are well-versed with powers of Home Ministry in Union territories and NCT Delhi, you can easily answer questions on stand-offs between state government and LG s- a very common question in GS II.  But if you do not even know what is the jurisdiction of State Government. Merely your opinions do not matter. Therefore, read and revise.

Avoid anything oily as it can make you drowsy but at the same time do not eat too light that you feel hungry in the midst of exam.

Also, pack something to eat for break. The two hour break is considerable time and after the stressful paper I, hunger becomes aggravated.

“I’m confident I will crack Prelims today. I have studied hard. I will do well”.

If you continuously tell it of your failures, your weaknesses, you will become more weak. But if you feed positive thoughts, you will get all that you want. In fact, you can repeat this exercise every night before going to sleep.

The difference between them is the former was over-thinking while the latter was merely minding his business. When you over-think, you give way to negative thoughts and consequently doubt yourself. Whereas the other breed just does their work in the best possible way and leaves the rest. They do not bother about results.

It’s like preparing for marathon and not being able to run sprint. And thus judging your running capability.

All they look for is an honest, diligent person with integrity. Of course,.

All they look for is an honest, diligent person with integrity. Of course, I do possess the afore mentioned virtues. But what is required is also a deep knowledge of your DAF topics.

Having an interest in reading proves instrumental in your bid to become a civil servant.

Your sphere of study resources to a bare minimum. Read only 1 newspaper, 1 online resource and study only 1 credible textbook/notes for any subject.

The importance of getting salary at the end of every month can't be overstated.

Devoting at least 2-3 hours per day towards reading and revising newspaper is a good habit which goes a long way in securing excellent marks in all three stages of the examination.

For instance, if the Government comes up with an important legislation and if you are regular with the newspaper then you will be a witness to its entire journey starting from formulation stage, debate stage and contrasting opinions from entire spectrum of political parties, civil society, public and other stakeholders. Thus reading newspaper is an immersive and enlightening process which magazines can't emulate.

While reading newspaper, focus on front page, national, editorial, international and business section only.

Like you can quote organisations that work in a certain field when a question is asked. For example, UNICEF for infant mortality, WTO for international trade, WHO for global health, Lancet for medicine, Doctors without Borders for migration related issues etc. No one will check it. But it should sound logical. You cannot quote UNICEF for citing reports on birds extinction!.

Remember not all IAS officers are happy and not all happy people are IAS officers.
