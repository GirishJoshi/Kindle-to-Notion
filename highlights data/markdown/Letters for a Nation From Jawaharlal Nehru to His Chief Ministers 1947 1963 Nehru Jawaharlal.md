Yet politics—a domain of pressing, ceaseless demands—offered an uneasy career for those like him who strove for self-reflection and sought careful scrutiny of their own actions.

By the time Nehru wrote his final letter on 21 December 1963, nearly four hundred letters had been written.

The third book, The Discovery of India, is a text often read as an argument for India’s essential unity.

Democracy could be consolidated. Now, as prime minister, Nehru was at pains to emphasize that democracies had no special claim to survival. They were as likely to succeed or fail as any other form of political association, and India’s liberty was as contingent.

Democratic success in India would ultimately rest neither on radical institutional design which could magically work itself nor on any one special personality.

Feature—Nehru’s sense that democratic success in India would ultimately rest neither on radical institutional design which could magically work itself nor on any one special personality.

Making a nation, rather than merely administering it, was Nehru’s unique responsibility.

‘a secular State in which men of all communities can walk with their heads high’.

‘I am filled with deep distress and a sense of failure . . . We cannot run away from the task that history has set for us. But a cruel destiny seems to pursue us and nullify all our efforts’.

Democracies, he feared, had an odd capacity to encourage false optimism. Merely because the overall system was considered fair, its participants might be led to believe that things were proceeding according to plan and thus lose sight of the transformative potential of democratic politics.

In a speech in the Lok Sabha in 1956 Nehru refused to define socialism because he sought to avoid ‘any rigid or doctrinaire thinking’. ‘Even in my life,’ he observed, ‘I have seen the world change so much that I do not want to confine my mind to any rigid dogma.’.

The greatest talent of those in government, Rousseau once observed, is ‘to lead the state so peacefully that it appears not to need leaders’.

I have mentioned them in some of my public statements, but they are so important that I make no apology for reiterating them.

The remedy, he felt, lay in education rather than communal or caste reservations which would only intensify the focus on identity.

Maintaining throughout that communalism was among the greatest threats to India.

Some people talk rather foolishly of war, not perhaps appreciating what this means.

The danger to us is not so much external as internal.

The danger to us is not so much external as internal. Reactionary forces and communal organisations are trying to disrupt the structure of free India.

We have a great deal of evidence to show that the R.S.S. is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the technique of organisation.
