As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  I keep science for Life.

How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?.

Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere?  Eating as usual, I see, Algy!.

When one is in town one amuses oneself.  When one is in the country one amuses other people.

The way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.  It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.

Really don’t see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.  If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.

Algernon.  I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.  If ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.

Is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.

More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn’t read.

Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.  That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.

But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  ‘From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’.

The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!.

In order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.

The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one’s clean linen in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.

Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.

One plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.  But.

Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.

A girl brought up with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!.

Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.

I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.

I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.  You can’t go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.

My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.

What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!.

The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.

Is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don’t mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.

Algernon.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don’t mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.

Keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life.  If I didn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.

The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is what Fiction means.

No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.

As a man sows, so shall he reap.

Hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.

Algernon.  I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.

Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.

You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon rises, Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest.

Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never wrong.

Do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.

When I see a spade I call it a spade.

This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners.

Am trespassing on your valuable time.

Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter would probably get on my cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quite calmly.  It is the only way to eat them.

How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out.  You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.

You can’t possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.  It’s absurd.  I never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that.

Matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.

In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.

How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.

That sounds not unsatisfactory.

Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only people who can’t get into it do that.

To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each other’s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.

Grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously,.

I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.
