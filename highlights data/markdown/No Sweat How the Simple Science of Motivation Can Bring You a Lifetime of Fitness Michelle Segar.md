I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

One day after school, when I was at odds with myself and the world, I decided to put on my sneakers and jog around the neighborhood. I was probably out for only about fifteen minutes, but the effect on my mood was profound. At that moment something within me clicked. From then on I understood that when I was feeling low, getting outdoors and moving would help.

Although I’ve always enjoyed running, I really love to walk. I rely on walking not only to nourish my body but also to clear my mind.

My interdisciplinary research challenges the status quo within the health promotion and healthcare industries by showing that logical rewards like “health” and “weight loss” do not motivate people to sustain health-related behavior as well as immediate and emotional rewards such as “well-being.”.

Yet the secret to achieving sustainable self-perpetual behavior change lies precisely in understanding how to create goals, motivation, and behavior that reflect what is most aligned with and meaningful to our sense of self.

No Sweat is written for individuals looking for real and sustainable ways to feel better, live better, and become happier, healthier, and fit.

Some personal projects may be focused on achievement (for example, learning to play the piano) or obtaining something (getting that promotion). Other personal projects focus on the process (spending time with your family, being a better parent, trying to relax more). They may be things you choose to do (read a book for pleasure), things you have to do (get your teeth cleaned, find a second job), things you are working toward (that trip to the Galapagos, learning to control your temper), or things you are trying to avoid (going into debt, fighting with your partner).
