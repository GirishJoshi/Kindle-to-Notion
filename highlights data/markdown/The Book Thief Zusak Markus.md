THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN A BOY WHO HATES YOU A boy who loves you.

Yes, often, I am reminded of her, and in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell.

It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right.

Each one an attempt an immense leap of an attemptto prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.

A few days after Liesel started school, she went along with the Steiners. Rudys mother, Barbara, made him promise to walk with the new girl, mainly because shed heard about the snowball. To Rudys credit, he was happy enough to comply. He was not the junior misogynistic type of boy at all. He liked girls a lot, and he liked Liesel (hence, the snowball). In fact, Rudy Steiner was one of those audacious little bastards who actually fancied himself with the ladies. Every childhood seems to have exactly such a juvenile in its midst and mists. Hes the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and hes the type who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had.

Hes the boy who refuses to fear the opposite sex, purely because everyone else embraces that particular fear, and hes the type who is unafraid to make a decision. In this case, Rudy had already made up his mind about Liesel Meminger.

At school, Rudy made a special point of seeking Liesel out during the breaks. He didnt care that others made noises about the new girls stupidity. He was there for her at the beginning, and he would be there later on, when Liesels frustration boiled over. But he wouldnt do it for free.

In 1933, 90 percent of Germans showed unflinching support for Adolf Hitler. That leaves 10 percent who didnt. Hans Hubermann belonged to the 10 percent.

Whispering adults hardly inspired confidence.

An eleven-year-old girl is many things, but she is not stupid.

Theyre strange, those wars. Full of blood and violencebut also full of stories that are equally difficult to fathom. Its true, people will mutter. I dont care if you dont believe me. It was that fox who saved my life, or, They died on either side of me and I was left standing there, the only one without a bullet between my eyes. Why me? Why me and not them?.

The two of them gradually became friends due to the fact that neither of them was terribly interested in fighting. They preferred rolling cigarettes to rolling in snow and mud. They preferred shooting craps to shooting bullets. A firm friendship was built on gambling, smoking, and music, not to mention a shared desire for survival. The only trouble with this was that Erik Vandenburg would later be found in several pieces on a grassy hill. His eyes were open and his wedding ring was stolen. I shoveled up his soul with the rest of them and we drifted away. The horizon was the color of milk. Cold and fresh. Poured out among the bodies.

He was not well-educated or political, but if nothing else, he was a man who appreciated fairness. A Jew had once saved his life and he couldnt forget that. He couldnt join a party that antagonized people in such a way. Also, much like Alex Steiner, some of his most loyal customers were Jewish. Like many of the Jews believed, he didnt think the hatred could last, and it was a conscious decision not to follow Hitler. On many levels, it was a disastrous one.

Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew.

He seemed to resonate with a kind of confidence that life was still nothing but a jokean endless succession of soccer goals, trickery, and a constant repertoire of meaningless chatter.

Hans Hubermann always knew what to say, when to stay, and when to leave her be. Perhaps Liesel was the one thing he was a true expert at.

I am stupid, Hans Hubermann told his foster daughter. And kind. Which makes the biggest idiot in the world. The thing is, I want them to come for me. Anythings better than this waiting.

He would part his hair from the opposite side to everyone else. He would make himself a small, strange mustache. He would one day rule the world.

The young man wandered around for quite some time, thinking, planning, and figuring out exactly how to make the world his. Then one day, out of nowhere, it struck himthe perfect plan. Hed seen a mother walking with her child. At one point, she admonished the small boy, until finally, he began to cry. Within a few minutes, she spoke very softly to him, after which he was soothed and even smiled.

The young man rushed to the woman and embraced her. Words! He grinned. What? But there was no reply. He was already gone. Yes, the Fhrer decided that he would rule the world with words. I will never fire a gun, he devised. I will not have to. Still, he was not rash. Lets allow him at least that much. He was not a stupid man at all. His first plan of attack was to plant the words in as many areas of his homeland as possible.
