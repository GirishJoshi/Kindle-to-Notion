The inflow performance relationship (IPR) was presented in a traditional and standardized manner, with the bottomhole flowing pressure on the ordinate of a graph and the corresponding production rate on the abscissa. This type of depiction gives a comprehensive picture of what the reservoir can deliver into the well at a specific time.

Positive-displacement pump performance is evaluated based on the volume of fluid displaced, not the pressure increase generated by the pump, since.

Reservoir engineering in its widest sense overlaps production engineering to a degree. The distinction is frequently blurred both in the context of study (single well versus multiple well) and in the time duration of interest (long term versus short term). Single-well performance, undeniably the object of production engineering, may serve as a boundary condition in a fieldwide, long-term reservoir engineering study. Conversely, findings from the material balance calculations or reservoir simulation further define and refine the forecasts of well performance and allow for more appropriate production engineering decisions.

Term “net height” may be used to account for only the permeable layers in a geologic sequence.

Measuring the spontaneous potential (SP) and knowing that sandstones have a distinctly different response than shales (a.

SP log is used to find reservoir thickness.

If the water is present but does not flow, the corresponding water saturation is known as “connate” or “interstitial.” Saturations larger than this value would result in free flow of water along with hydrocarbons.

“standard conditions,” that is, usually (but not always) 14.7 psi and 60° F. Flowing oil and gas in the reservoir.

Pressure and temperature are “standard conditions,” that is, usually (but not always) 14.7 psi and 60° F.

An attractive hydrocarbon saturation is the third critical variable (along with porosity and reservoir height) to be determined before a well is tested or completed.

A specific point is the critical point, where the properties of liquid and gas converge. For each temperature less than the critical-point temperature (to the left of Tc in Figure 1-3) there exists a pressure called the “bubble-point” pressure, above which only liquid (oil) is present and below which gas and liquid coexist. For lower pressures (at constant temperature), more gas is liberated.

Reservoirs above the bubble-point pressure are called “undersaturated.”.

If the initial reservoir pressure is less than or equal to the bubble-point pressure, or if the flowing bottomhole pressure is allowed to be at such a value (even if the initial reservoir pressure is above the bubble point), then free gas will at least form and will likely flow in the reservoir. This type of a reservoir is known as “two-phase” or “saturated.” For temperatures larger than the critical.

If the initial reservoir pressure is less than or equal to the bubble-point pressure, or if the flowing bottomhole pressure is allowed to be at such a value (even if the initial reservoir pressure is above the bubble point), then free gas will at least form and will likely flow in the reservoir. This type of a reservoir is known as “two-phase” or “saturated.”.

For temperatures larger than the critical point (to the right of Tc in Figure 1-3), the curve enclosing the two-phase envelop is known as the “dew-point” curve. Outside, the fluid is gas, and reservoirs with these conditions are “lean” gas reservoirs.

The maximum temperature of a two-phase envelop is known as the “cricondentherm.” Between these two points there exists a region where, because of the shape of the gas saturation curves, as the pressure decreases, liquid or “condensate” is formed.

This happens until a limited value of the pressure, after which further pressure reduction results in revaporization. The region in which this phenomenon takes place is known as the “retrograde condensation” region, and reservoirs with this type of behavior are known as “retrograde condensate reservoirs.”.

Petroleum thermodynamic properties are known collectively as PVT (pressure–volume–temperature) properties.

Advances in 3-D and wellbore seismic techniques, in combination with well testing, can increase greatly the region where knowledge of the reservoir extent (with height, porosity, and saturations) is possible.

This factor is simply a ratio of the volume of liquid or gas under reservoir conditions to the corresponding volumes under standard conditions. Thus, for oil,.

Thus the oil formation volume factor is invariably larger than 1, reflecting the swelling of the oil volume because of the gas dissolution. The reader is.

The oil formation volume factor (res bbl/STB), Bo, is not a simple physical property. Instead, it is an empirical thermodynamic relationship allowing for the reintroduction into the liquid (at the elevated reservoir pressure) of all of the gas that would be liberated at standard conditions.

For production engineering calculations these correlations are rarely useful, except when considering matrix stimulation. In this instance, correlations of the altered permeability with the altered porosity after stimulation are useful.

Darcy observed that the flow rate (or velocity) of a fluid through a specific porous medium is linearly proportional to the head or pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet and a characteristic property of the medium. Thus,.

If fluids of other viscosities flow, the permeability must be divided by the viscosity and the ratio k/μ is known as the “mobility.”.

Matrix stimulation is intended to recover or even improve the near-wellbore permeability. (There is damage associated even with stimulation. It is the net effect that is expected to be beneficial.) Hydraulic fracturing, today one of the most widely practiced well-completion techniques, alters the manner by which fluids flow to the well; one of the most profound effects is that near-well radial flow and the damage associated with it are eliminated.

Contamination of the produced fluid from the other formations or the loss of fluid into other formations can be envisioned readily in an open-hole completion.

If no zonal isolation or wellbore stability problems are present, the well can be open hole. A.

Slotted liners can be used if a cemented and cased well is not deemed necessary and are particularly common in horizontal wells where cementing is more difficult.

Finally, to combat the problems of sand or other fines production, screens can be placed between the well and the formation. Gravel packing can be used as an additional safeguard and as a means to keep permeability-reducing fines away from the well.

If the bottomhole pressure is sufficient to lift the fluids to the top, then the well is “naturally flowing.” Otherwise, artificial lift is indicated.

Another technique is to reduce the density of the fluid in the well and thus to reduce the hydrostatic pressure.

Both the IPR and the VFP relate the wellbore flowing pressure to the surface production rate.

The IPR represents what the reservoir can deliver, and the VFP represents what the well can deliver.

The intersection of the IPR with the VFP yields the well deliverability, an expression of what a well will actually produce for a given operating condition. The role of a petroleum production engineer is to maximize the well deliverability in a cost-effective manner.

.

The concept of the dimensionless productivity index combines flow geometry and skin effects, and can be calculated for any well by measuring flow rate and pressure (reservoir and flowing bottomhole) and some other basic but important reservoir and fluid data.

A negative skin effect can be imposed if a successful hydraulic fracture is created.

Finally, more favorable well geometry such as horizontal or complex wells can result in much higher values of JD.

Increasing the drawdown (p – pwf) by lowering pwf is the other option available to the production engineer to increase well deliverability.

While the IPR remains the same, reduction of the flowing bottomhole pressure would increase the pressure gradient (p – pwf) and the flow rate, q, must increase accordingly.

Flowing bottomhole pressure may be lowered by minimizing the pressure losses between the bottomhole and the separation facility (by, for example, removing unnecessary restrictions, optimizing tubing size, etc.), or by implementing or improving artificial lift procedures. Improving well deliverability by optimizing the flow system from the bottomhole location to the surface production facility is a major role of the production engineer.

Well performance evaluation and enhancement are the primary charges of the production engineer.

The measurement of (or sometimes, simply the understanding of) the rate-versus-pressure drop relationships for the flow paths from the reservoir to the separator; (2).

Well testing, which evaluates the reservoir potential for flow and, through measurement of the skin effect, provides information about flow restrictions in the near-wellbore environmental; and.

Production logging measurements or measurements of pressure, temperature, or other properties by permanently installed downhole instruments, which can describe the distribution of flow into the wellbore, as well as diagnose other completion-related problems.

Chapters 1–10 describe the workings of the reservoir and well systems.

Well deliverability analysis predicts the wellbore flowing pressure for a given surface flowrate.

This expression assumes a single-phase fluid flowing and saturating the reservoir.

Steady-state performance means that all parameters, including flow rate and all pressures, are invariant with time.

For a vertical well draining a region with radius re, this requires that the pressure at the well boundary, pe, and the bottomhole flowing pressure, pwf, are constant with time. Practically, the boundary pressure, pe, for a production well can remain constant only in the presence of pressure maintenance, either by natural water influx from an aquifer or by injection to maintain pressure in the reservoir.

A reservoir being waterflooded is the most common situation for which steady-state behavior approximates the actual production well conditions.

Near-wellbore region is extremely important in well production because that is where much of the pressure drop occurs.

One of the main purposes of production engineering is to maximize the productivity index in a cost-effective manner, that is, to increase the flow rate for a given driving force (drawdown) or to minimize the drawdown for a given rate.

In reservoirs where the viscosity is very large (μ > 100 cp), thermal recovery may be indicated to reduce the viscosity.

These ratios indicate that the drainage area assigned to a well has a small impact on the production rate.

The diffusivity equation describes the pressure profile in an infinite-acting, radial reservoir, with a slightly compressible and constant viscosity fluid (undersaturated oil or water).

The pressure at the outer boundary is no longer constant but instead declines at a constant rate with time, as does the pressure at every point in the well drainage volume. That is, ∂p/∂t = constant everywhere.

Because the pressure profile is not changing, this condition is often referred to as “pseudosteady state.”.

If the required bottomhole flowing pressure to deliver a certain inflow is smaller than the tubing pressure difference caused by a fluid with a given flowing gradient, then artificial lift may be employed.

For gas lift, gas is injected continuously or intermittently at selected location(s) along the production string, resulting in a reduction in density of the mixture in the tubing, and thus reducing the hydrostatic component of the pressure difference from the bottom to the top of the well. The.

This pressure drawdown must not violate restrictions for sand control and water or gas coning.

Gas lift can only be applied when hydrostatic pressure drop is the problem of wellbore flow, not frictional pressure drop.

Large amounts of gas injected into the well will affect the separation facilities at the top.

There exists a limit gas–liquid ratio (GLR) above which the pressure difference in the well will begin to increase because the reduction in the hydrostatic pressure will be offset by the increase in the friction pressure.

The positioning of the gas-lift valves and their number is a matter of wellbore hydraulics optimization.

To increase field production, well improvement can be more effective than infill drilling, especially when the new wells are just as suboptimum as existing wells.

Optimized well completions do not sacrifice ultimate field recovery as long as they are achieved with adequate reservoir pressure support from either natural gas cap or water drive mechanisms or through injection wells.

In particular, widespread use of horizontal wells and much broader application of hydraulic fracturing have changed the face of production practices and justified critical updating of the text.

To simplify the presentation of realistic examples, data for three characteristic reservoir types—an undersaturated oil reservoir, a saturated oil reservoir, and a gas reservoir—are presented in the Appendixes. These data sets are used throughout the book.

Petroleum production involves two distinct but intimately connected general systems: the reservoir, which is a porous medium with unique storage and flow characteristics; and the artificial structures, which include the well, bottomhole, and wellhead assemblies, as well as the surface gathering, separation, and storage facilities. Production engineering is that part.

Petroleum production involves two distinct but intimately connected general systems: the reservoir, which is a porous medium with unique storage and flow characteristics; and the artificial structures, which include the well, bottomhole, and wellhead assemblies, as well as the surface gathering, separation, and storage facilities.

In distinguishing production engineering from, for example, reservoir engineering, the focus is often on specific wells and with a short-time intention, emphasizing production or injection optimization. In contrast, reservoir engineering takes a much longer view and is concerned primarily with recovery. As such, there may be occasional conflict in the industry, especially when international petroleum companies, whose focus is accelerating and maximizing production, have to work with national oil companies, whose main concerns are to manage reserves and long-term exploitation strategies.

Modern formation evaluation provides a composite reservoir description through three-dimensional (3-D) seismic, interwell log correlation and well testing. Such description leads to the identification of geological flow units, each with specific characteristics. Connected flow units form a reservoir.

There is little doubt that the best petroleum engineers are those who understand the geological processes of deposition, fluid migration, and accumulation. Whether a reservoir is an anticline, a fault block, or a channel sand not only dictates the amount of hydrocarbon present but also greatly controls well performance.

Ordinarily, there would be only one set of optimum directions.

The porosity of the reservoir can be measured based on laboratory techniques using reservoir cores or with field measurements including logs and well tests.

Temperature, except in the case of high-rate gas wells, is for all practical purposes constant.

One of the purposes of cementing is to support the casing, but at formation depths the most important reason is to provide zonal isolation.

From Equation (2-25) and substitution of the appropriate variables in Appendix A, the well production rate is given by For t = 2 months, for Equation (2-27) the production rate q = 627 STB/d.

Here value of B and Mu are to be taken at initial condition instead of bubble point.

Material balance calculations presented in Chapter 10 combine depletion mechanisms with inflow relationships and lead to forecasts of well performance and cumulative production.

Smaller values denote damage, and larger values denote stimulation,.

Even if they are assigned regular geographic drainage areas, these are distorted after production commences, either because of the presence of natural boundaries or because of lopsided production rates in adjoining wells. The drainage area is then shaped by the assigned production duty of a particular well.

All well deliverability equations relate the well production rate and the driving force in the reservoir, that is, the pressure difference between the initial, outer boundary or average reservoir pressure and the flowing bottomhole pressure.

If the bottomhole pressure is given, the production rate can be obtained readily. However, the bottomhole pressure is a function of the wellhead pressure, which, in turn, depends on production engineering decisions, separator or pipeline pressures, and so on. Therefore, what a well will actually produce must be the combination of what the reservoir can deliver and what the imposed wellbore hydraulics would allow.

In petroleum reservoirs, however, water is always present at least as connate water, denoted as Swc. Thus, in all previous equations in this chapter the permeability should be considered as effective, and it would be invariably less (in certain cases significantly less) than the one obtained from core flooding or other laboratory techniques using a single fluid.

These effective permeability values are related to the “relative” permeability values (also rock properties) by.

Relative permeability values are determined in the laboratory and are characteristic of a given reservoir rock and its saturating fluids. It is not a good practice to use relative permeability values obtained for one reservoir to predict the performance of another.

Such a well is often referred to as a “stripper” with the production rates of less than 10 STB/d of oil.

The ratio qw/qo is referred to as the water–oil ratio.

If the pressure, pe, at the drainage boundary can be approximated as being constant, the steady-state equation should be used. If there is no effect of a boundary felt at the well, transient flow is occurring. Finally, if the boundary at re is a no-flow boundary being felt at the well, the well performance is pseudosteady-state.

Expansion of oil itself as a means of recovery is a highly inefficient mechanism because of the oil’s small compressibility. It is likely that even in the best of cases (the issue is addressed in Chapter 10), if the bottomhole pressure is above the bubble-point pressure, as is the case for heavy oil, a very small fraction of the original-oil-in-place would be recovered.

The gas cases there is a much more pronounced reduction in the temperature along the path, reflecting Joule-Thomson expansion effects associated with gas flow. Solid lines connote single-phase flow.

Contained within a reservoir with potential lateral heterogeneities or discontinuities (sealing faults), vertical boundaries (shale lenses), and anisotropies (stress or permeability).

Knowing that formation brines are good conductors of electricity (i.e., they have poor resistivity) and hydrocarbons are the opposite, a measurement of this electrical property in a porous formation of sufficient height can detect the presence of hydrocarbons.

They proved to be successful in a great number of applications which include thin reservoirs (h < 50 ft), heavy oil, tight formations (k < 0.1 md) with multiple hydraulic fractures, highly heterogeneous reservoirs, or even thick reservoirs with good vertical permeability, kV. Figure 5-1 presents the drainage pattern of a horizontal well with a length, L.

They proved to be successful in a great number of applications which include thin reservoirs (h < 50 ft), heavy oil, tight formations (k < 0.1 md) with multiple hydraulic fractures, highly heterogeneous reservoirs, or even thick reservoirs with good vertical permeability, kV. Figure 5-1 presents the drainage pattern of a horizontal well with a length, L. The concept of horizontal wells is extending the contact with the reservoir, thus changing the drainage pattern from radial flow in vertical wells to a combination of radial, linear, and elliptical flows. Reducing water or gas coning is another main benefit of horizontal wells.

Of particular importance in the production from horizontal wells is the horizontal-to-vertical permeability anisotropy.

Sufficient vertical permeability is required for a horizontal well to be beneficial. Low vertical permeability or discontinuities in vertical permeability may render horizontal wells unattractive in relatively thick formations.

A well that is drilled normal to the larger horizontal permeability direction would be a better producer than one drilled in an arbitrary direction or normal to the smaller horizontal permeability. The larger this permeability anisotropy, the more important.

A well that is drilled normal to the larger horizontal permeability direction would be a better producer than one drilled in an arbitrary direction or normal to the smaller horizontal permeability. The larger this permeability anisotropy, the more important the well azimuth becomes.

Stress measurements in the pilot hole can identify the maximum and minimum horizontal stress directions. While different correlations exist between stress and permeability, almost always stress and permeability directions coincide: the maximum horizontal stress orientation is along maximum permeability and the minimum horizontal stress is along the minimum permeability. Therefore, a horizontal well that is not intended to be hydraulically fractured should be drilled along the direction of minimum horizontal stress.

In the Joshi model the well is centered in an elliptical-shaped drainage boundary.

The Furui et al. model is based on a geometry of a horizontal well centered in a box-shaped drainage boundary.

The steady-state flow model developed by Joshi (1988) was one of the first analytical models for horizontal well inflow.

Negative skin mainly results from well stimulation, such as matrix acidizing discussed in Chapters 14–16 or hydraulic fracturing discussed in Chapters 17 and 18, and it can also be observed in a highly inclined wellbore. This chapter is mainly about positive skin effects.

Positive skin effects can be created by causes such as partial completion (i.e., a perforated thickness that is less than the reservoir thickness), by inadequate number of flowing perforations or slots, by phase changes (relative permeability reduction to the main fluid), by turbulence, and, of course, by near-wellbore alteration of the natural reservoir permeability.

(scomp)d is the combined effect of the completion and permeability damage surrounding the completion, sc is the skin due to partial completion, and sθ is the deviated well skin effect.

These pseudoskins include all phase- and rate-dependent effects.

All “pseudoskins” are grouped together within the summation sign. These pseudoskins include all phase- and rate-dependent effects.

The rate-dependent effect was discussed in Chapter 4 in conjunction with the turbulence in high-rate gas producers.

(It can also affect very high-rate oil wells with large gas–oil ratios.).

This skin effect is equal to Dq, where D is the non-Darcy coefficient (see Section 4.4).

Phase-dependent skin effects are associated with phase changes because of the near-wellbore pressure gradient.

A similar phenomenon can be observed in the case of gas retrograde condensate reservoirs, where liquid is formed around the well, causing a reduction in gas permeability. This is a particularly adverse occurrence. While the gas that is formed in an oil reservoir will reenter solution at an elevated pressure (e.g., as the pressure builds up when the well is shut in), in the case of a gas condensate reservoir much of the formed condensate will not reenter the gas.

Permeability impairment to gas in gas condensate reservoirs is not eliminated following a shut-in. Thus, after reopening the well, the gas flow rate is still affected by the near-wellbore permeability reduction. A method to combat this skin effect is by the injection of neat natural gas, which may re-dissolve the condensate and displace it into the reservoir. This “huff-and-puff” operation can be repeated periodically.

However, the reader must be alerted here that once a hydraulic fracture is generated, most pretreatment skin effects ((scomp)d, sc, sθ) are bypassed and have no impact on the post-treatment well performance. Phase- and rate-dependent skin effects are either eliminated or contribute in the calculation of the fracture skin effects. In general, it is not correct to add pretreatment skin effects to any post-fracture skin effects.

The smaller the perforated interval, compared to the reservoir height and the less it is centered in the total formation height, the larger the skin effect would be. If the completed interval is 75% of the reservoir height or more, this skin effect becomes negligible.

While partial completion generates a positive skin effect by reducing the well exposure to the reservoir, a deviated well has an opposite impact. The larger the deviation angle, the larger the negative contribution to the total skin effect because of the increased amount of reservoir contact by the wellbore. The skin effect due to well deviation is denoted by sθ.

Deviated well has higher productivity than a vertical well through the same reservoir because of the longer length of wellbore in contact with the formation in the deviated well case. Thus, a skin factor accounting.

A deviated well has higher productivity than a vertical well through the same reservoir because of the longer length of wellbore in contact with the formation in the deviated well case. Thus, a skin factor accounting for this effect will always be negative.

Two factors that are likely to have important influences on partial completion skin effects are the reservoir anisotropy and the location of the completed interval in the reservoir, because the convergence of flow to the completed interval in the vertical direction is the cause of the positive partial completion skin.

The flow geometry in a reservoir containing a horizontal lateral is radial near the well and can be predominantly linear far from the well,.

Vertical well (with no hydraulic fracture), only radial flow is dominant. As a result, while the fully penetrated vertical well is totally insensitive to permeability anisotropy, both vertical and lateral permeability anisotropy is important to the horizontal well productivity, and both impact damage mechanisms.

In general, the effect of near well formation damage for a horizontal well completion is relatively small compared with vertical wells. However, if the reservoir thickness is large and/or vertical permeability is small, radial or elliptical flow becomes dominant and the impact of formation damage on a horizontal lateral can be significant. The importance of formation damage in a horizontal lateral can be determined by comparing the magnitude of the damage and completion skin factor with other terms in a horizontal inflow equation.

Oil and gas wells are completed in a variety of ways, with the most common completions being open-hole completions; cased, perforated completions; slotted or perforated liner completions; and gravel-pack completions.

Modern well perforating is done with perforating guns that are attached either to a wireline or to tubing or coiled tubing.

This pattern allows good perforation density with small phasing.

Helical pattern.

The perforating string contains a cable head, a correlation device, a positioning device, and the perforation guns.

The perforating string contains a cable head, a correlation device, a positioning device, and the perforation guns. The cable head connects the string to the wireline and at the same time provides a weak point at which to disconnect the cable if problems arise. The correlation device is used to identify the exact position with a previously run correlation log, and frequently it locates casing collars. The positioning device orients the shots toward the casing for more optimum perforation geometry. The perforating guns are loaded with shape charges, which consist of the case, the explosive, and the liner, as shown in Figure 6-14. Electric current initiates an explosive wave; the sequences of the detonation process are shown in Figure 6-14. Perforations with a diameter between 0.25 and 0.4 in. and a length between 6 and 12 in. are typically created. Significantly longer perforations can be created with special charges in some formations.

Perforating is often done underbalanced; that is, the pressure in the well is less than the reservoir pressure at the moment the perforations are created.

This facilitates immediate flow-back following the detonation, carrying the debris out of the perforations and resulting in a cleaner perforation cavity. The dimensions, number, and phasing of perforations have a controlling role in well performance.

This facilitates immediate flow-back following the detonation, carrying the debris out of the perforations and resulting in a cleaner perforation cavity. The dimensions, number, and phasing of perforations have a controlling role in well performance.

The impact of horizontal to vertical permeability anisotropy is different for perforations in a horizontal well than in a vertical well. In both cases the pressure drop associated with flow to the perforation cavity depends on the orientation of the perforation relative to the orientation of the permeability anisotropy. Because of the vertical permeability often being significantly lower than the horizontal permeability, the skin factor for a perforated horizontal well completion can be different from that of a vertical well. Perhaps more significantly, a horizontal perforated completion’s productivity depends on the orientation of the perforations relative to the permeability field. In a formation with low vertical permeability (high Iani), perforations oriented up and down will be more productive than perforations oriented horizontally.

When there is formation damage around a cased, perforated completion, the combined effect of the perforation skin factor and the damage skin factor can be much greater than the sum of these separate effects. This is because the converging flow to the perforations creates a high-pressure drop if the permeability is reduced in this region.

Slotted or perforated liners are commonly used to complete horizontal and multilateral wells.

If these slots or perforations are plugged, or if there is formation damage in the few inches near the openings where the flow is converging, very high skin factors can result.

If these slots or perforations are plugged, or if there is formation damage in the few inches near the openings where the flow is converging, very high skin factors can result. Slotted or perforated liners are placed in horizontal wellbores, but not cemented in place. If the borehole is very stable so that the formation does not collapse around the liner, the well should behave like an openhole completion, and the simple Hawkins’ formula can describe the skin factor if there is formation damage present. If the formation deforms to contact the liner, flow convergence to the slots or perforations can lead to much higher completion skin factors.

For cased and perforated well completions with efficient perforating (i.e., sp < 0), skin factors are lower than for an open-hole completion. The perforations extending beyond the damage zone create flowpaths through the damage zone so that the effect of formation damage becomes less important.

Gravel pack completions are commonly used in poorly consolidated formations to prevent sand production.

Two types are common, open-hole and cased-hole gravel packs,.

This equation shows that as long as the permeability of the gravel is high compared with the formation permeability, an open-hole gravel pack will not restrict production.

The flow to the gravel-packed cavity extending into the formation is analogous to the flow to a perforated completion or to the flow to a perforated liner completion, depending on the lengths of the perforations and the permeability of the gravel packed in the perforation tunnel. If the perforations are very short or the permeability of the gravel in the perforation tunnels is low, the completion will behave essentially like a perforated liner; longer perforations containing high permeability gravel result in the completion behavior of a cased, perforated well.

Formation damage can be caused by plugging of the pore spaces by solid particles, by mechanical crushing or disaggregation of the porous media, or by fluid effects such as the creation of emulsions or changes in relative permeability.

When fines are moving through a porous medium, they will often be deposited, and if this deposition occurs in the pore throats, a severe reduction in the permeability may result.

Large particles transported to the surface of the porous medium will bridge over the surface pores and form a filter cake external to the porous medium.

Numerous studies have shown that a sudden decrease in salinity of the brine flowing through a sandstone will cause formation damage by dispersing clay particles. This phenomenon, called water sensitivity, depends on the cations present in the brine, the pH, and the rate of salinity change. In general, monovalent cations are much more damaging than divalent or trivalent cations; the water sensitivity is greatest for NaCl brines and decreases in the order Na+ > K+ > NH4+. The higher the pH, the more sensitive the porous medium will be to salinity changes.

Asphaltenes are high-molecular-weight aromatic and napthenic compounds that are thought to be colloidally dispersed in crude oils (Schechter, 1992). This colloidal state is stabilized by the presence of resins in the crude oil; when these resins are removed, the asphaltenes can flocculate, creating particles large enough to cause formation damage. Chemical changes to the crude oil that reduce the resin concentration can thus lead to asphaltene deposition in the formation.

The most common organic species that cause formation damage are waxes (paraffins) and asphaltenes. Waxes are long-chain hydrocarbons that precipitate from certain crude oils when the temperature is reduced, or the oil composition changes because of the.

The most common organic species that cause formation damage are waxes (paraffins) and asphaltenes. Waxes are long-chain hydrocarbons that precipitate from certain crude oils when the temperature is reduced, or the oil composition changes because of the liberation of gas as the pressure is reduced.

If a water-wet formation is changed to oil-wet around the wellbore, the oil-relative permeability may be greatly reduced in the near-wellbore region.

The most common source of formation damage in wells is the drilling process. Drilling damage results from the invasion of the formation by drilling fluid particles and drilling fluid filtrate. The damage caused by drilling fluid particles is likely to be the more severe.

Damage to the formation during well completion operations can be caused by invasion of completion fluids into the formation, by cementing, by perforating, or by well stimulation techniques.

It is recommended that completion fluids contain no more than 2 ppm of solids of a size less than 2 μm.

An alternative to underbalanced perforating to obtain clean perforations is to perforate with extreme overbalance.

In this technique the pressure in the wellbore is well above the fracturing pressure at the moment the perforations are created, with wellbore pressure gradients typically greater than 1.0 psi/ft. Additionally, the wellbore and/or tubing are partially filled with gas so that the high pressure is maintained for a short duration after the perforations are created.

Well stimulation fluids, though intended to increase the productivity of a well, can cause formation damage themselves by solids invasion of the formation or precipitation. The potential for damage from stimulation fluids is discussed in the chapters on well stimulation.

Injection wells are susceptible to formation damage caused by the injection of solid particles,.

Injection wells are susceptible to formation damage caused by the injection of solid particles, by precipitation due to incompatibility of injected and formation water, or by the growth of bacteria. Solids injection is always a danger if the injected water is not well filtered; filtration to remove all particles larger than 2 μm is recommended.

The most common problem of this type is the injection of water with relatively high concentrations of sulfate or carbonate ions into formations with divalent cations, such as calcium, magnesium, or barium present.

In other words, the fact that no precipitation occurs when a sample of formation water is mixed with a sample of injection water is not sufficient to guarantee that no precipitation will occur in the formation.

A light gas reservoir is one that contains primarily methane with some ethane and traces of higher molecular-weight gases.

A rich or heavy gas reservoir may have a gravity equal to 0.75 or, in some rare cases, higher than 0.9. Such gravity would mean a significant concentration of ethane plus propane and butane. In commercial practice, the latter two components are removed and sold as natural gas liquids (NGLs).

A gas with a high content of H2S is often referred to as a “sour” gas.

Natural gas with H2S and/or CO2 is called acid gas.

Otherwise, natural gas without acidic components is called sweet gas.

The formation volume factor relates the reservoir volume to the volume at standard conditions of any hydrocarbon mixture. In the case of a natural gas, the formation volume factor, Bg, can be related with the application of the real gas law for reservoir conditions and for standard conditions.

Wellbore flow can be divided into several broad categories, depending on the flow geometry, the fluid properties, and the flow rate. First, the flow in a wellbore is either single phase or.

Wellbore flow can be divided into several broad categories, depending on the flow geometry, the fluid properties, and the flow rate.

Single phase or multiphase;.

The flow geometry of interest in the wellbores is usually flow through a circular pipe, though flow in an annular space, such as between tubing and casing, sometimes occurs.

PVT behavior and their rheological characteristics, must be considered in describing wellbore flow performance.

Depending on the flow rate and the fluid properties, flow in a wellbore may be either laminar or turbulent, and this will strongly influence the flow behavior.

When the flow is laminar, the fluid moves in distinct laminae, with no fluid motion transverse to the bulk flow direction.

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in circular pipes generally occurs at a Reynolds number of 2100, though this value can vary somewhat depending on the pipe roughness, entrance conditions, and other factors (Govier and Aziz, 1977).

As the viscosity increases, the likelihood of laminar flow also increases.

Laminar flow occurs at relatively high flow rates in wells in which a viscous fluid is being produced or injected.

ΔpPE accounts for the pressure change due to the weight of the column of fluid (the hydrostatic head); it will be zero for flow in a horizontal pipe.

In laminar flow, the friction factor is a simple function of the Reynolds number,.

In turbulent flow, the friction factor may depend on both the Reynolds number and the relative pipe roughness, ε.

In turbulent flow, the friction factor may depend on both the Reynolds number and the relative pipe roughness, ε. The relative roughness is a measure of the size of surface features on the pipe wall protruding into the flow stream compared with the pipe diameter,.

The Fanning friction factor is most commonly obtained from the Moody friction factor chart (Figure 7-7; Moody, 1944). This chart was generated.

The Colebrook-White equation is implicit in ff, requiring an iterative procedure, such as the Newton-Raphson method, for solution.

There are many instances in production operations in which flow in the annular space between a tubing string and a casing string occurs, including injection of gas down the annulus in a gas lift completion, injection of workover fluids down the annulus, and production of gas up the annulus.

Compressibility of the fluid must be considered. When the fluid is compressible, the fluid density and fluid velocity.

To calculate the pressure drop in a gas well, the compressibility of the fluid must be considered. When the fluid is compressible, the fluid density and fluid velocity vary along the pipe, and these variations must be included when integrating the mechanical energy balance equation.

The kinetic energy pressure drop is negligible compared with the potential energy and frictional contributions to the overall pressure drop.

Two-phase flow behavior depends strongly on the distribution of the phases in the pipe, which in turn depends on the direction of flow relative to the gravitational field. In this chapter, upward vertical and inclined flow are described; horizontal and near-horizontal flow are treated in Chapter.

In two-phase flow, the amount of the pipe occupied by a phase is often different from its proportion of the total volumetric flow rate. As an example of a typical two-phase flow situation, consider the upward flow of two phases, α and β, where α is less dense than β, as shown in Figure 7-8. Typically, in upward two-phase flow, the lighter phase (α) will be moving faster than the denser phase (β). Because of this fact, called the holdup phenomenon, the in-situ volume fraction of the denser phase will be greater than the input volume fraction of the denser phase—that is, the denser phase is “held up” in the pipe relative to the lighter phase.

Vβ = volume of denser phase in pipe segment and V = volume of pipe segment. The holdup, yβ, can also be defined in terms of a local holdup, yβl,.

In gas–liquid flow, the holdup of the gas phase, yα, is sometimes called the void fraction.

Input fraction of each phase,.

The input volume fractions, λα and λβ, are also referred to as the “no-slip holdups.”.

Slip velocity is defined as the difference between the average velocities of the two phases.

Slip velocity is not an independent property from holdup, but is simply another way to represent the holdup phenomenon. In order to show the relationship between holdup and slip velocity, we introduce the definition of superficial velocity, usα or usβ, defined as.

The “flow regime” or flow pattern is a qualitative description of the phase distribution.

In gas–liquid, vertical, upward flow, four flow regimes are now generally agreed upon in the two-phase flow literature: bubble, slug, churn, and annular flow.

In this section we consider correlations used to calculate the pressure drop in gas–liquid two-phase flow in wells.

Beggs and Brill correlation is applicable to any pipe inclination and flow direction.

The Beggs and Bill (1973) correlation differs significantly from that of Hagedorn and Brown in that the Beggs and Brill correlation is applicable to any pipe inclination and flow direction. This method is based on the flow regime that would occur if the pipe were horizontal; corrections are then made to account for the change in holdup behavior with inclination.

The Gray correlation was developed specifically for wet gas wells and is commonly used for gas wells producing free water and/or condensate with the gas.

Thus, we must divide the total distance into increments small enough that the flow properties, and hence the pressure gradient, are almost constant in each increment. Summing the pressure drop in each increment, we obtain the overall pressure drop. This stepwise calculation procedure is generally referred to as a pressure traverse calculation. Since both the temperature and.

Thus, we must divide the total distance into increments small enough that the flow properties, and hence the pressure gradient, are almost constant in each increment. Summing the pressure drop in each increment, we obtain the overall pressure drop. This stepwise calculation procedure is generally referred to as a pressure traverse calculation.

The temperature profile is usually approximated as being linear between the surface temperature and the bottomhole temperature, as shown in Figure 7-15.

Pressure traverse calculations can be performed either by fixing the length increment and calculating the pressure drop, or by fixing the pressure drop and finding the depth interval over which this pressure drop would occur (Brill and Beggs, 1978).

Fixing the length interval is often more convenient when programming a pressure traverse calculation for computer solution; fixing the pressure drop increment is more convenient for hand calculations.

For oil production, this facility is typically a two- or three-phase separator;.

For gas production, the facility may be a gas plant, a compressor station, or simply a transport pipeline; and for injection wells,.

The flow regime does not affect the pressure drop as significantly in horizontal flow as it does in vertical flow because there is no potential energy contribution to the pressure drop in horizontal flow.

Most important, the occurrence of slug flow necessitates designing separators or sometimes special pieces of equipment (slug catchers) to handle the large volume of liquid contained in a slug.

These can be classified as three types of regimes: segregated flows, in which the two phases are for the most part separate; intermittent flows, in which gas and liquid are alternating; and distributive flows, in which one phase is dispersed in the other phase.

Segregated flow is further classified as being stratified smooth, stratified wavy (ripple flow), or annular. Stratified smooth flow consists of liquid flowing along the bottom of the pipe and gas flowing along the top of the pipe, with a smooth interface between the phases. This flow regime occurs at relatively low rates of both phases. At higher gas rates, the interface becomes wavy, and stratified wavy flow results. Annular flow occurs at high gas rates and relatively high liquid rates and consists of an annulus of liquid coating the wall of the pipe and a central core of gas flow, with liquid droplets entrained in the gas.

Slug flow consists of large liquid slugs alternating with high-velocity bubbles of gas that fill almost the entire pipe. In plug flow, large gas bubbles flow along the top of the pipe, which is otherwise filled with liquid.

Distributive flow regimes described in the literature include bubble, dispersed bubble, mist, and froth flow. The bubble flow regimes differ from those described for vertical flow in that the gas bubbles in a horizontal flow will be concentrated on the upper side of the pipe. Mist flow occurs at high gas rates and low liquid rates and consists of gas with liquid droplets entrained. Mist flow will often be indistinguishable from annular flow, and many flow regime maps use “annular mist” to denote both of these regimes. “Froth flow” is used by some authors to describe the mist or annular mist flow regime.

Input liquid fraction,.

The correlations we have just examined provide a means of calculating the pressure gradient at a point along a pipeline; to determine the overall pressure drop over a finite length of pipe, the variation of the pressure gradient as the fluid properties change in response to the changing pressure must be considered. The simplest procedure is to evaluate fluid properties at the mean pressure over the distance of interest and then calculate a mean pressure gradient.

When fluids pass through pipe fittings (tees, elbows, etc.) or valves, secondary flows and additional turbulence create pressure drops that must be included to determine the overall pressure drop in a piping network. The effects of valves and fittings are included by adding the “equivalent length” of the valves and fittings to the actual length of straight pipe when calculating the pressure drop.

The flow rate from almost all flowing wells is controlled with a wellhead choke, a device that places a restriction in the flow line.

A variety of factors may make it desirable to restrict the production rate from a flowing well, including the prevention of coning or sand production, satisfying production rate limits set by regulatory authorities, and meeting limitations of rate or pressure imposed by surface equipment.

When gas or gas–liquid mixtures flow through a choke, the fluid may be accelerated sufficiently to reach sonic velocity in the throat of the choke.

When this condition occurs, the flow is called “critical,” and changes in the pressure downstream of the choke do not affect the flow rate because pressure disturbances cannot travel upstream faster than the sonic velocity.

Upstream to the downstream pressure.

P2 is upstream.

The flow through a wellhead choke rarely consists of single-phase liquid, since the flowing tubing pressure is almost always below the bubble point. However, when this does occur, the flow rate is related to the pressure drop across the choke.

The flow coefficient for flow through nozzles is given in Figure 8-11 (Crane, 1957) as a function of the Reynolds number in the choke and the ratio of the choke diameter to the pipe diameter.

This equation applies for subcritical flow, which will usually be the case for single-phase liquid flow.

The choke diameter is often referred to as the “bean size” because the device in the choke that restricts the flow is called the bean.

Bean sizes are usually given in 64ths of an inch.

When the pressure ratio is less than the critical pressure ratio, p2/p1 should be set to (p2/p1)c.

Equations (8-69) and (8-70) apply when the pressure ratio is equal to or greater than the critical pressure ratio, given by.

Since the flow rate is insensitive to the downstream pressure whenever the flow is critical. For air and other diatomic gases, γ is approximately 1.4, and the critical pressure ratio is 0.53; in petroleum engineering operations, it is commonly assumed that flow through a choke is critical whenever the downstream pressure is less than about half of the upstream pressure.

When a well is being produced with critical flow through a choke, the relationship between the wellhead pressure and the flow rate is controlled by the choke, since downstream pressure disturbances (such as a change in separator pressure).

When a well is being produced with critical flow through a choke, the relationship between the wellhead pressure and the flow rate is controlled by the choke, since downstream pressure disturbances (such as a change in separator pressure) do not affect the flow performance through the choke. Thus, the attainable flow rate from a well for a given choke can be determined by matching the choke performance with the well performance, as determined by a combination of the well IPR and the vertical lift performance. The choke performance curve is a plot of the flowing tubing pressure versus the liquid flow rate, and can be obtained from the two-phase choke.

Thus, the attainable flow rate from a well for a given choke can be determined by matching the choke performance with the well performance, as determined by a combination of the well IPR and the vertical lift performance. The choke performance curve is a plot of the flowing tubing pressure versus the liquid flow rate, and can be obtained from the two-phase choke correlations, assuming that the flow is critical.

The Gilbert correlation predicts that the flowing tubing pressure is a linear function of the liquid flow rate, with an intercept at the origin.

The intersections of the choke performance curves with the well performance curve are the flow rates that would occur with these choke sizes. Note that the choke correlation is valid only when the flow through the choke is critical; for each choke, there will be a flow rate below which flow through the choke is subcritical. This region is indicated by the dashed portions of the choke performance curves—the predictions are not valid for these conditions.

P2 is downstream.

When flow is subcritical, the downstream pressure can influence the performance of the wells, and the flow through the entire piping network may have to be treated as a system.

When individual flow lines all join at a common point (Figure 8-14, left) the pressure at the common point is equal for all flow lines. The common point is typically a separator in an oil production system.

In a gathering system where individual wells are tied into a common pipeline, so that the pipeline flow rate is the sum of the upstream well flow rates as in Figure 8-14 (right), each well has a more direct effect on its neighbors. In this type of system, individual wellhead pressures can be calculated by starting at the separator and working upstream.

Rigorous method to calculate the actual wellbore pressure drop for a horizontal well with single-phase flow is to divide the well into a number of segments and use the average flow rate in the segment to compute the frictional.

A rigorous method to calculate the actual wellbore pressure drop for a horizontal well with single-phase flow is to divide the well into a number of segments and use the average flow rate in the segment to compute the frictional pressure drop in that segment.

Many nominally horizontal wells are not truly horizontal and slight variations in inclination can have profound effects on multiphase flow. Some “horizontal” wells are angled upward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-up” well); some are angled slightly downward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-down” well); and others may have both upward and downward inclined sections (an undulating well).

Many nominally horizontal wells are not truly horizontal and slight variations in inclination can have profound effects on multiphase flow. Some “horizontal” wells are angled upward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-up” well); some are angled slightly downward from the heel to the toe (a “toe-down” well); and others may have both upward and downward inclined sections (an undulating well). These trajectories are sometimes intentional for purposes such as augmenting artificial lift of liquids from gas wells. Other times, the final trajectory of the well being not perfectly horizontal is simply a result of the directional drilling process or because of a dip in the reservoir.

For upward flow (an upward inclination in the flow direction), liquid holdup will be higher than in a perfectly horizontal pipe because of the tendency for the liquid to fall back down the well.

It is also common in undulating well trajectories for the denser phase to accumulate in low spots (sumps) and the lighter phase to accumulate in the high spots (crests).

For a required wellhead flowing pressure, ptf, there exists a corresponding bottom hole flowing pressure, pwf, which is a function of the hydrostatic pressure difference and the frictional pressure losses in the tubing string.

Density differences and phase changes affect both the hydrostatic and the frictional pressure drops.

For two-phase flow an increase in the imposed wellhead pressure ordinarily would result in an even larger increase in the corresponding bottomhole pressure because gas will be redissolved, increasing the density of the fluid in the wellbore.

Thus, it is common to combine a single-phase oil or gas IPR with two-phase VFP.

Increasing the flowing gas–liquid ratio (GLR) would result in a reduction in the bottomhole pressure.

Increasing the flowing gas–liquid ratio (GLR) would result in a reduction in the bottomhole pressure. This is the purpose of gas lift. However, there exists a limiting GLR where the decrease in the hydrostatic pressure with be offset by the increase in the frictional pressure drop.

The IPR curve is shown in the pwf versus q plot.

The intersection of the two curves provides the expected production rate and the bottomhole flowing pressure.

For low-GLR fluids the hydrostatic pressure would comprise the overwhelming portion of the pressure gradient in the well. Therefore, the frictional pressure drop would be relatively small and, since it is the pressure component affected most by the flow rate, the associated VFP curve is likely to be flat.

For higher GLR values or for a gas well, the VFP curve is not expected to be linear. When two-phase gas–liquid flow is occurring in the tubing, there is usually a minimum pwf on the VFP curve. This minimum occurs because at low liquid flow rates, the liquid holdup, and hence the hydrostatic pressure drop, decreases with increasing flow rate.

The minimum occurs at the flow rate at which the increase in frictional pressure drop for rates above the minimum is greater than the decrease in hydrostatic pressure drop.

At this value of flow rate the change in the frictional pressure drop is equal in magnitude to the change in hydrostatic pressure drop.

Well deliverability is affected both by the well flow performance and the reservoir inflow.

Reduction in the bottomhole pressure, either by lowering the wellhead pressure (usually not feasible) or, especially, through artificial lift, would shift the VFP curve downward, resulting in the maintenance of the original production rate or retardation of its decline.

The main difference between single-phase and two-phase reservoirs is that the producing GLR in the latter will vary with time as the reservoir pressure declines. Gas coming out of solution in the reservoir will enter a growing gas cap, causing a free-flowing gas. This will be mixed in the well with the oil flow, which will also contain an amount of solution gas. As a result, the VFP curve will change with time and will shift downward. However, a new IPR at the lower reservoir pressure will be in effect. The composite effect is that while the well producing rate will decline, it will do so at a lower pace than the producing rate of single-phase reservoirs.

Approximate expressions can be obtained by substituting for the real-gas pseudo-pressures with the pressure-squared difference divided by the product of the average values of the viscosity and the gas deviation factor.

The vertical flow performance of a gas well consists of the hydrostatic and friction pressure drop components, just as for any other well.

Why is KE not significant.

When the VFP curve intersects a very steep portion of the IPR curve, like the 3 1/2 in. and 4 in. VFP curves, the production rate is insensitive to the tubing size.

In this case, to significantly increase the production rate, the well must be stimulated and the production rate is reservoir-limited. If, on the other hand, the VFP curves intersect a portion of the IPR that has a shallower slope, or the VFP curves themselves have a significant positive slope, as did the 2 3/8 in. and 2 7/8 in. VFP curves, changing the tubing conditions (or adding artificial lift) can significantly increase the production rate, while well stimulation will have less benefit. Such wells are referred to as tubing-limited. In general, a tubing-limited condition should be avoided if possible.

ΔpKE is the pressure drop resulting from a change in the velocity of the fluid between positions 1 and 2. It will be zero for an incompressible fluid unless the cross-sectional area of the pipe is different at the two positions of interest. From Equation (7-15),.

ΔpKE is the pressure drop resulting from a change in the velocity of the fluid between positions 1 and 2. It will be zero for an incompressible fluid unless the cross-sectional area of the pipe is different at the two positions of interest.

Combining Equations (7-24) and (7-26), the kinetic energy pressure drop due to a pipe diameter change for an incompressible fluid.

In the previous chapter the well inflow and vertical flow performances (IPR and VFP) were combined to provide the well deliverability.

The intersection of the plots of flow rate versus bottomhole flowing pressure of those two components of the reservoir and well system is the expected well deliverability.

Depends greatly on the type of flow regime controlling the well performance.

It depends greatly on the type of flow regime controlling the well performance.

Material balance calculations, relating underground withdrawal and reservoir pressure depletion, can provide the crucial pressure-time relationship. Therefore, the associated well deliverability would be the forecast of well production.

By definition, for steady-state flow, a single IPR curve would intersect the VFP curve. For pseudosteady-state flow the situation is more complicated because the average reservoir pressure will change with time. Given the values of the average reservoir pressure, , a family of IPR curves can be drawn, each intersecting the pwf axis at the individual reservoir pressures. What is needed is the element of time. Material balance calculations, relating underground withdrawal and reservoir pressure depletion, can provide the crucial pressure-time relationship. Therefore, the associated well deliverability would be the forecast of well production.

The well IPR can be calculated from the solution to the diffusivity equation.

In an infinite-acting reservoir, the well IPR can be calculated from the solution to the diffusivity equation.

Unless the wellhead pressure changes, there will be only one VFP curve for the well, and its intersections with the IPR curves will be the well production rate.

The fluid recovery from an undersaturated oil reservoir depends entirely on the fluid expansion as a result of underground withdrawal and associated pressure reduction.

Havlena and Odeh (1963, 1964) introduced the application of material balance to oil reservoirs that have initial oil-in-place N and a ratio m relating the initial hydrocarbon volume in the gas cap to the initial hydrocarbon volume in the oil zone.

For gas lift, gas is injected continuously or intermittently at selected location(s) along the production string, resulting in a reduction in density of the mixture in the tubing, and thus reducing the hydrostatic component of the pressure difference from the bottom to the top of the well. The purpose is to bring the fluids to the top at a desirable wellhead pressure, while keeping the bottomhole pressure at a value that is small enough to provide good driving force in the reservoir. This pressure drawdown must not violate restrictions for sand control and water or gas coning.

The liquid level in the annual isolates injected gas from the formation,.

Packers are used in the annulus, and a ball valve is used in the production tubing to prevent injected gas from flowing into the formation.

Both a single injection point and multiple injection points can be employed. First, a liquid slug must be built in the tubing above the bottom valve. Then, the valve opens, displacing the liquid slug upward. The valve remains open until the slug reaches the top, and then the valve closes. It reopens when a new liquid slug builds in the bottom of the well.

For multiple injection points, the bottom valve opens as described for the single-injection-point operation, but as the liquid slug moves upward, valves below the slug open. The valves close after the slug reaches the top. The actuation of the valves for intermittent gas lift can be done with a timing device or can depend on the pressure.

Preset pressure is provided by a pressure dome with a diaphragm, springs, or a combination of pressure dome and springs.

When casing or tubing pressure is higher than the preset pressure of the valves, the valve opens; otherwise, it remains closed.

Pressure differences are graphed against depth.

Δptrav is the pressure traverse and is a function of the flow rate, the GLR, the depth, and the properties and composition of the fluid.

For small values (< 100) or relatively large values (> 1500) of GLR, the gradient can usually be considered as largely constant for common well depths (≈ 10,000 ft). For intermediate values, dp/dz is not constant but, instead, is a function of depth.

Suppose that the natural GLR1 would result in a pressure traverse requiring an unacceptably large pwf. Then, for a more desirable pwf, injecting gas at a rate qg would lead to a higher GLR2. If the liquid rate is ql, then.

The gas added to the flow stream in the tubing in a gas-lifted well is injected down the casing-tubing annulus.

The pinj in the production tubing is an additional 100 to 150 psi less than the annulus pressure because of the pressure drop across the gas-lift valve.

The point of gas injection, Hinj, creates two zones in the well: one below, with an average flowing pressure gradient (dp/dz)b, and one above, with an average flowing pressure gradient (dp/dz)a. Thus,.

It should be obvious that the downhole gas injection pressure in the annulus, pinj,ann, must not be greater than the pressure within the tubing for gas to enter the tubing at the injection point.

Concept of continuous gas lift in terms of the pressure values, pressure gradients, well depth, and depth of injection.

The higher the required wellhead pressure, the lower the flowing gradient should be.

The position in the tubing where the downhole pressure of the injected gas is equal to the pressure in the tubing.

The actual point of injection is placed a few hundred feet higher to account for the pressure drop across the gas-lift valve, Δpvalve.

The calculated horsepower would be an important variable in gas-lift optimization design.

Most newly drilled wells are filled with kill fluids or completion fluids that have higher density than reservoir fluids.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading the kill fluid or completion fluid in the wellbore. The.

When a well is ready to produce, gas lift is commonly used to start the well production by unloading the kill fluid or completion fluid in the wellbore. The fluid column can be hard to lift because of the high hydrostatic pressure.

The unloading procedure starts from the top-most valve. Gas injected through the first valve will lift the liquid column from the valve location to the surface, reducing the total hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. Then the first valve is closed, and the next valve below opens to lift the column from the second valve location upward. The procedure repeats until the entire wellbore is unloaded. The.

Very commonly, to start the procedure, a higher surface pressure at the annulus side is used, marked as kickoff pressure, pk,.

The pressure gradient inside the tubing is the wellbore fluid pressure gradient, which is much higher because of the denser fluid in the wellbore (in the figure, 0.4 psi/ft as an example).

The depth of the first valve is determined by the intercept of the two pressure gradient curves (annulus and tubing), which indicates that at the first valve location, the gas injected has high enough pressure to lift the liquid column.

Pth is the tubing head pressure, and gk and gg are the pressure gradients for kill fluid and injected gas.

The intercept of the tubing fluid gradient curve with the annulus gas pressure gradient curve defines the second valve’s location.

Notice that after the first column is lifted, a higher tubing head pressure is used in the calculation for the locations of the rest of the valves to provide a safety factor.

Once the well is unloaded, only the deepest operating valve is open for continuous gas-lift production.

Investigate the effect of increasing the gas injection rate, and therefore increasing the GLR in the wellbore. First, increasing the gas injection rate allows the injection at a lower point in the tubing without increasing the injection pressure.

Hinj increases [with the associated smaller (dp/dz)a] and since (dp/dz)b remains largely constant within a smaller interval H – Hinj, then pwf will necessarily decrease.

Hinj increases [with the associated smaller (dp/dz)a] and since (dp/dz)b remains largely constant within a smaller interval H – Hinj, then pwf will necessarily decrease. Therefore larger oil production rates are likely to be achieved with higher GLR and a lower injection point.

Similarly, to sustain a production rate while the reservoir pressure depletes, the flowing bottomhole pressure must be lowered. This can be accomplished by lowering the injection point and by increasing the gas injection rate. The initial operating valve may not be the deepest valve of the set, and the lower valve can be used in later life of the well production. This has a limit, addressed in the next section.

Limit value of GLR,.

Where the flowing pressure gradient is the minimum. For GLR values that are larger than the minimum,.

Where the flowing pressure gradient is the minimum. For GLR values that are larger than the minimum, the flowing gradient begins to increase.

While increasing the GLR from small values would result in a fluid density reduction with modest friction pressures, continued GLR increase would lead to a disproportionate increase in the friction pressure. Thus, the limit GLR is that value at which the increase in frictional pressure will offset the decrease in the hydrostatic pressure.

The limit GLR increases as the production rate decreases. Figure 11-9 is for a smaller liquid production rate (ql = 500 STB/d) in the same size well. In this example the limit GLR is approximately 7000 SCF/STB. This limit GLR for which the minimum pwf will be obtained is rarely the natural GLR of the reservoir fluids. Thus, it can be reached only through artificial gas lift.

A larger well size would lead to a larger limit GLR, with, of course, a larger gas injection rate.

The IPR curve, as always, characterizes the ability of the reservoir to deliver certain combinations of production rates and flowing bottomhole pressures.

For each liquid production rate there exists a limit GLR where the minimum pwf will be observed.

Intersecting this IPR curve is the optimum gas-lift performance curve of minimum flowing bottomhole pressures (minimum pressure intake curve), and for each production rate they correspond to the limit GLR.

Each gas-lift performance curve in the vicinity of the maximum production rate will result in a larger pressure intake and therefore lower production.

Maximum production rate is at the limit GLR.

Limit GLR corresponds to maximum ql.

The gas-lift GLR minus the natural GLR times the liquid production rate is the required gas injection rate as.

A plot of the gas injection rate versus the production rate is another gas-lift performance curve.

As the reservoir pressure declines, the driving force in the reservoir is reduced and therefore, in order to sustain a given production rate, the flowing bottomhole pressure must be reduced accordingly.

Sustaining a production rate would require an increase in the gas injection rate as the reservoir pressure declines.

Maximizing the liquid production rate with gas lift requires an increase in the gas injection rate, since the limit GLR is larger for smaller production rates in a given tubing size.

Downhole pumps are a common means of boosting the productivity of a well by lowering the bottomhole flowing pressure.

Downhole pumps increase the pressure at the bottom of the tubing a sufficient amount to lift the liquid stream to the surface.

The pressure gradient in the tubing is actually higher in a pumped well than it would be without the pump because most of the gas produced with the liquids is vented through the casing-tubing annulus.

Much of the free gas in the bottom of the well would be redissolved in oil at the higher pump outlet pressure, increasing the fluid density and gradient.

Positive-displacement pumps, which include sucker rod pumps and progressing cavity pumps (PCPs), and dynamic displacement pumps, the most common of which is the electrical submersible pump (ESP).

Plunger lift, commonly used to unload liquids from gas wells.

The work supplied by the pump is related to the increase in pressure across the pump by the mechanical energy balance equation, which for incompressible.

Ws is the work supplied by the pump, p2 is the pressure in the tubing just above the pump, p1 is the pressure just below the pump, and F is the frictional loss in the pump.

The pressures on either side of the pump are related to the bottomhole flowing pressure by the pressure gradient in the gas-liquid stream below the pump and to the surface pressure by the single-phase liquid gradient in the tubing.

From the surface tubing pressure, p2 is determined based on single-phase liquid flow at the desired rate.

The rotary motion of the crank is translated to a reciprocating motion of the polished rod by the Pitman and the walking beam; the sucker rods transmit the reciprocating motion from the polished rod to the down-hole pump.

Barrel with a ball-and-seat check valve at its bottom (the standing valve) and a plunger containing another ball-and-seat check valve (the traveling valve).

When the plunger moves up, the standing valve opens, the traveling valve closes, and the barrel fills with fluid.

On a down stroke, the traveling valve opens, the standing valve closes, and the fluid in the barrel is displaced into the tubing.

Positive-displacement pump performance is evaluated based on the volume of fluid displaced, not the pressure increase generated by the pump, since the compression of the wellbore fluid in the pump will create enough pressure to displace the fluid in the tubing.

Q is the downhole volumetric flow rate (bbl/d), N is the pump speed (strokes per minute, spm), Ev is the volumetric efficiency, Ap is the plunger cross-sectional area (in.2), and Sp is the effective plunger stroke length (in.).

The effective plunger stroke length will differ from and generally be less than the polished rod stroke length because of the stretching of the tubing and the rod string and because of overtravel caused by the acceleration of the rod string.

Ep is the plunger overtravel, et is the length the tubing is stretched, and er is the length the rod string is stretched.

Note that if the tubing is anchored, the tubing stretch will be zero.

The next step in designing a sucker rod pump installation is the determination of the power requirements for the prime mover.

The prime mover must supply sufficient power to provide the useful work needed to lift the fluid; to overcome frictional losses in the pump, the polished rod, and the rod string; and to allow for inefficiencies in the prime mover and the surface mechanical system. Thus the required prime mover power is.

Ph is the hydraulic horsepower needed to lift the fluid, Pf is the power dissipated as friction in the pump, and Fs is a safety factor accounting for primer mover inefficiency.

The hydraulic power is usually expressed in terms of net lift, LN,.

The net lift is the height to which the work provided by the pump alone can lift the produced fluid.

The net lift is the height to which the work provided by the pump alone can lift the produced fluid. If the tubing and casing pressure is zero at the surface and the liquid level in the annulus is at the pump, the net lift is simply the depth at which the pump is set.

The first one is for gear box rating; the second is for peak beam loading; and the last one for maximum stroke length.

The maximum load on the top sucker rod and on the beam of the pumping unit occurs during the upstroke when the rod weight, buoyed in the liquid, the liquid weight, and the upstroke dynamic loads are being lifted. Thus,.

The net gear box torque carried by the pumping unit is the difference between the torque created by the well load during the stroke and the offsetting counterbalance torque.

The performance characteristics of sucker rod pumps are commonly monitored by measuring the load on the polished rod with a dynamometer.

A recording of the polished rod load over one complete pump cycle is referred to as a “dynamometer card.” The dynamometer card plots polished rod load as a function of rod position.

An up-stroke begins and the polished rod load gradually increases as the rods stretch until at point b the polished rod supports the weight of the rods in the fluid and the weight of the fluid. The load remains constant.

The acceleration and deceleration of the rod string accounts for most of the difference between the ideal load history and the actual history of the polished rod in a properly operating rod-pumped well.

Notice the decreasing load on the upstroke and the loop in the curve at the end of the upstroke. A restriction in the well leads to an increasing load on the upstroke and little pump work, as indicated by the area of the region enclosed by the load curve.

Liquid pound occurs when the pump barrel does not fill completely on the upstroke and is characterized by a sudden decrease in load near the end of the downstroke.

Gas pound (Figure 12-6f) occurs when the pump partially fills with gas and exhibits a similar character to liquid pound, but the decrease in load is not as pronounced on the downstroke.

When the pump is almost completely filled with gas, gas lock has occurred, resulting in a dynamometer card like that in Figure 12-6g.

This card shows a decreasing load on the upstroke and little pump work. Finally, plunger undertravel and overtravel are indicated by cards like those in Figures 12-6h and 12-6i. With plunger undertravel, the load increases throughout the upstroke, whereas with overtravel, the load decreases throughout the upstroke.

When gas is present in the pump barrel, much of the pump energy is expended in compressing the gas instead of lifting the liquid.

When gas is present in the pump, on a downstroke, the gas must be compressed until the pressure in the barrel is equal to the pressure in the tubing above the pump before the traveling valve will open and allow fluid to pass into the tubing.

On an up-stroke, the gas must expand until the pressure is below p1, the pressure in the casing just below the pump, before the standing valve will open and.

On an up-stroke, the gas must expand until the pressure is below p1, the pressure in the casing just below the pump, before the standing valve will open and let wellbore fluids enter the barrel.

In extreme cases, essentially nothing will occur in the pump except the expansion and compression of gas; in this instance, the pump is said to be “gas-locked.”.

Free gas from entering a sucker rod pump. This is accomplished by setting the pump below the perforations so that the.

Some means must be employed to exclude most, if not all, of the free gas from entering a sucker rod pump. This is accomplished by setting the pump below the perforations so that the gas will rise out of the liquid stream moving to the pump or by employing various mechanical means to separate the gas from the liquid stream. Downhole devices installed on rod pumps to separate gas from the liquid are called “gas anchors.”.

Progressing cavity pump (PCP). This pump consists of a helically spiraling rotor that rotates inside of a doubly helical stator made of an elastomeric material.

The PCP geometry creates sealed cavities that progress from the pump inlet to the pump outlet as the rotor turns, thus displacing the fluid in the cavities.

A progressing cavity pump is commonly driven by a rotating rod string,.

Alternatively, a PCP can be driven by an electrical submersible motor, which makes a PCP practical in deviated and/or deep wells in which rod strings are impractical.

Progressing cavity pumps are better suited to handling fluids such as sand-laden or high-viscosity fluids than are rod pumps. For a thorough review of progressing cavity pumps,.

An electrical submersible pump (ESP) is a multistage centrifugal pump that offers a great deal of flexibility. ESPs are capable of producing very high volumes of liquid, can be used efficiently in deeper wells than sucker rod pumps, and are able to handle some free gas in the pumped fluid.

The motor is situated so that the produced fluids flow around the motor, providing cooling, either by setting the pump above the producing interval, or by equipping the pump with a shroud that directs the fluids past the motor before entering the pump intake.

Centrifugal pumps do not displace a fixed amount of liquid, as do positive-displacement pumps, but rather create a relatively constant amount of pressure increase to the flow stream.

The flow rate through the pump will thus vary, depending on the back pressure held on the system.

The pressure increase provided by a centrifugal pump is usually expressed as pumping head, the height of produced fluid that the Δp created by the pump can support:.

The pumping head is independent of the density of the fluid. For a multistage pump, the total head developed is equal to the sum of the pumping head from each stage,.

The pumping head of a centrifugal pump decreases as the volumetric throughput increases; however, the efficiency of the pump,.

As the reservoir pressure declines, the IPR curve will change, and hence the optimal pump design will gradually change. To design an ESP that will be optimal over a finite life span of the well involves a tradeoff between pumping requirements early in the life of the well and later in the life of the reservoir and is ultimately an economic question. Particularly in water-flooded reservoirs, where the water production rate may rise dramatically over the life span of the well, the pumping requirements may change drastically.

High fluid viscosity decreases the efficiency of a centrifugal pump and can affect the head developed. Pump manufacturers provide correction charts to.

High fluid viscosity decreases the efficiency of a centrifugal pump and can affect the head developed.

If the gas velocity in the tubing string is not sufficient to lift the liquids to the surface, liquid accumulates in the well, increasing the bottomhole pressure.

In relatively low-rate gas wells, the liquid accumulation can severely restrict the gas production rate, or may in fact kill the well (prevent flow).

The same pumps used in oil-producing wells, such as rod pumps or electrical submersible pumps, can be used to pump liquid from a gas well.

An alternative lifting method that is relatively inexpensive and requires no energy input is plunger lift. Plunger lift is a cyclical, intermittent lift method that uses the energy of the reservoir to lift the accumulated liquid from the tubing string.

The plunger is a hollow tube that fits snugly in the tubing string.

This chapter provides a brief overview of ways to quantify parameters essential to well performance evaluation and well completion or workover design.

Once the well has been cased and completed, cased hole logs provide mechanisms to evaluate cement, saturation changes, or fluid movement behind the casing and to locate fluid entries along the well.

Transient well analysis includes traditional pressure transient analysis and production data analysis.

Quantification of permeability and skin generally requires analysis of transient data.

The key to transient analysis is to understand how to recognize key streamline flow geometries, known as flow regimes, from their characteristic trends in the transient data. The flow regime overview provided in this chapter emphasizes the use of the log–log diagnostic plot for flow regime identification and estimation of parameters that are important to production engineering applications.

The final section of this chapter addresses diagnostic fracture injection tests as a means to determine permeability in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs with permeability that is so low that conventional methods fail.

Gamma ray log position clearly indicates the shaley intervals.

Furthermore, the photoelectric (PE) log is highest in limestone, second highest in shale, still lower in dolomite, and lowest in sandstone.

Wireline tools can also be used to perform a microfrac test that can provide the fracture initiation pressure.

As well, sonic and dipole sonic logs can provide estimates for rock mechanics properties versus depth, including Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Lithology changes identified from the gamma ray log, especially from sandstone or carbonate to shale, help to estimate hydraulic fracture height.

For example, clay minerals can be analyzed that are needed for matrix acid design.

Relationship between porosity and permeability and, in the case of carbonates, the acid penetration versus rate and volume injected. These variables are used in the design of acidizing treatments and the simulation of their effectiveness.

Differential strain curve analysis.

Such measurements point toward hydraulic fracture orientation and azimuth and, implicitly, the direction of reservoir permeability anisotropy, maximum permeability is generally in the direction of maximum horizontal stress, minimum permeability in the direction of minimum stress.

Pressure transient tests also provide a mechanism to quantify post completion, stimulation, and workover properties that cannot be determined from open-hole logs.

Cased hole logs include both static logs acquired while the well is shut in and production logs designed to measure properties of fluids as they are flowing through the wellbore.

Drilling and workover operations are often highly sensitive to the quality of the seal provided by the cement between the well casing and the formation.

Cement evaluation tool.

Combination of three log tracks on the left, combines gamma ray, caliper, fluid transit time, and relative bearing in the first track with minimum and maximum compressive strength and an angular average of acoustic impedance in the second track, and the circumferential bond image in the third track to the left of a track showing gas flags and reflection flags.

White spaces occur in this image when the cement bond is lacking and coincide with lower compressive strengths and higher incidence of gas and reflection flags.

Based on measurement of the time and amplitude of acoustic signals that travel through casing, cement, and formation rock in various annular paths along the borehole.

The CBT includes an average sonic transit time log in the first track, average amplitude in the middle track, and variable density imaged in the right-most track.

In particular, the right-most track shows percentages of solid cement (black), liquid mud (white), gas, (dotted area), and gas cut cement (gray).

For example, a series of cased hole logs can track changes in saturation near the wellbore that can be used to identify hydrocarbons that have been bypassed by injected water or gas or to characterize changes in fluid contact levels due to gas cap or water encroachment.

Production logging as an aid in diagnosing the case of poor well performance.

Productivity. For example, if a well has begun to produce an excessive water cut compared with neighboring.

Indicate remedial action to be taken to improve well productivity.

If a well has begun to produce an excessive water cut compared with neighboring wells, the increased water rate may be due to channeling from another zone behind pipe, water coning, or premature breakthrough in a high-permeability zone.

By running a suite of production logs that can locate channeling and measure the profile of water entry into the well, the engineer may be able to distinguish among these causes and, more important, properly plan a corrective workover, such as a cement squeeze treatment. Another commonly occurring problem is less than expected production based on normal decline. This may be the result of damage in one of the layers in a co-mingled production. It becomes essential to identify the problematic.

Supplement to the information gained from the well flow rate and pressure history and other well tests.

The engineer using production logging should always be mindful of the uncertainty that sometimes exists in these interpreted log results.

Lower-than-expected reservoir kh, low relative permeability to the hydrocarbon phase, formation damage, poorly penetrating or plugged perforations (or other restrictions in the completion, such as a partially plugged gravel pack), and wellbore restrictions.

Pressure transient test to measure the reservoir kh and skin factor, as described later in this chapter.

If the reservoir itself has been ruled out as the cause of low productivity, production logging can now be used to define more clearly the location and vertical extent of productivity impairment.

Channeling between the casing and the formation caused by poor cement conditions.

Is sometimes the cause of high water or gas production rates.

Measuring the mechanical properties of the cement behind the casing. To positively identify channeling, a production log that can respond to flow behind the casing is needed. Among the logs that can serve this purpose are temperature, radioactive tracer, and noise logs.

The temperature log exhibits cool anomalies caused by Joule-Thomson cooling at gas expansion locations, while the noise log measure increased noise amplitude at the same locations. Thus both logs respond to gas flow at the gas source, at a restriction in the channel behind the casing, and at the location of gas entry into the wellbore. Figure 13-7.

The temperature log exhibits cool anomalies caused by Joule-Thomson cooling at gas expansion locations, while the noise log measure increased noise amplitude at the same locations. Thus both logs respond to gas flow at the gas source, at a restriction in the channel behind the casing, and at the location of gas entry into the wellbore.

To eliminate the excessive gas production, a cement squeeze can be performed to block the flow in the channel. This can best be accomplished by perforating near the gas source and circulating cement through the channel.

Preferential flow of water or gas through high-permeability layers.

A common cause of high gas or water production in oil wells. Unwanted gas or water entries of this nature can sometimes be located with production logs.

Excessive water production may result from injected water in a waterflood or from water encroaching from an aquifer. An accurate flow profile of the production well can identify the location of the high-permeability zone or zones contributing to the high production rate. However, the location of the water entry is not generally sufficient information to identify the case of water production as being flow through a thief zone. Particularly if the water entry location is at the bottom of the completed interval, the water source may be channeling or coning from lower zones. Additional logs or tests are needed to distinguish among these possibilities.

Because the measurement and interpretation of the logs in the multiphase flow in production wells are generally less accurate (and more expensive) than those in a single-phase flow, in waterflood operations, water distribution in a reservoir is often monitored by measuring injection well profiles and assuming continuity of the reservoir layers between injectors and producers.

A prudent approach would be to first run temperature and fluid density logs. Both of these logs should locate the gas entry or entries qualitatively; in addition, the temperature log will help differentiate between production from a thief zone and gas production resulting from channeling.

From the cool anomaly on the temperature log and the decrease in fluid density, zone B is identified as the thief zone.

Gas coning results when a well is completed near a gas/oil contact and sufficient vertical permeability exists for gas to migrate downward to the wellbore as the pressure is drawn down around the well.

Distinguishing between coning and flow through a high-permeability layer will be difficult with production logs alone.

The most conclusive test for coning would be to produce the well at several different flow rates or drawdowns, as coning is inherently a rate-sensitive phenomenon.

Whether it is necessary to positively identify coning versus flow through a high-permeability layer depends on the actions being considered to correct the excessive gas or water production. If, in either case, the perforations producing the gas or water will be squeeze cemented or plugged back, it may not be important to determine with certainty if coning is occurring. However, future reservoir management practices could likely be improved by a clear knowledge of the mechanism of excessive gas or water production.

Problem with this particular well (channeling or coning) or is due to a surplus of injection water in the lower part of the reservoir.

Evidence of channeling or coning.

Temperature log, in particular, may indicate if flow is occurring from below the perforations.

If the pattern of water injection in one or more injection wells shows high water rates into the lowest zone, preferential flow through a high-permeability layer is the likely cause of the high water production.

The total rate from the production well could be lowered—if a rate is found where water production ceased, coning has been identified as the cause of excessive water production.

Production logging can provide useful information for the planning of well workovers, primarily by providing information about the distribution of flow of the various phases into the well.

Among the workovers that can benefit from post-treatment production logging are remedial cementing, reperforating, acidizing, fracturing, and water shutoff or profile modification treatments.

In a low-productivity well that is being reperforated, comparison of the flow profile before and after perforating should indicate the productivity of the reperforated intervals directly.

Because the injected fracturing fluid is generally significantly cooler than the formation being fractured at typical injection rates, the fracture fluid temperature where it exits the wellbore will be near the surface temperature.

As the treatment proceeds, the unfractured formation around the wellbore is cooled by radial heat conduction, as in any injection well, while cool fluid is placed in the fracture.

Because the radial heat transfer in the unfractured region is more rapid than the linear heat conduction in the fracture, the fractured region will warm more slowly, yielding a cool anomaly on a temperature log. Thus the fracture height can be identified by the location.

Because the radial heat transfer in the unfractured region is more rapid than the linear heat conduction in the fracture, the fractured region will warm more slowly, yielding a cool anomaly on a temperature log. Thus the fracture height can be identified by the location of a cool anomaly on a temperature log run after a brief (a few hours) shut-in period after fracturing.

Warm anomalies often appear in the region that may have been fractured; these may be due to variations in the formation thermal diffusivity, frictional heating of the fracturing fluid as it is injected at a high rate through perforations or in the fracture, from the fluid movement within the fracture after shut-in (Dobkins, 1981), or deviation of the fracture plan from intersection with the wellbore.

The vertical extent of the fracture is indicated by the region where the two logs diverge,.

When a warm anomaly appears on a post-fracture temperature log and no corresponding anomaly exists on the prefracture log, the warm anomaly is apparently caused by fluid movement in the fracture after shut-in derivation of the fracture from intersection with the wellbore.

When a warm anomaly appears on a post-fracture temperature log and no corresponding anomaly exists on the prefracture log, the warm anomaly is apparently caused by fluid movement in the fracture after shut-in derivation of the fracture from intersection with the wellbore. The warm-anomaly region would then be included as part of the interpreted fractured zone.

A measure of propped fracture height can be obtained by radioactively tagging the final portion of the proppant, then running a postfracture γ-ray log to locate the tagged proppant.

As with the temperature log, this method fails if the fracture plane is not coincident with the wellbore for the entire height of the fracture.

Among the problems that may arise are abnormally low or high injectivity, abnormal pressure or fluid level in the annulus, and low productivity or high water production in offset producers.

By measuring the amount of flow to each reservoir interval, or by checking for interval isolation, by finding leaks in the well equipment.

The fundamental information sought with a production log in an injection well is the flow profile, the amount of fluid being injected into each interval.

Flow profiles are measured in injection wells with temperature, radioactive tracer, and spinning flowmeter logs.

A change in rate and/or wellhead pressure often indicates a serious well or reservoir problem.

Abnormally low injectivity or a marked drop in injection rate can result from formation damage around the wellbore, plugged perforations, restrictions in the casing or tubing, or scaling.

Techniques that combine production logging with transient testing, such as the production log test, selective inflow performance, and the multilayer transient test provide the most complete information about abnormally high or low injectivity.

Logs obtained occasionally through the life of the well would show this as being a natural progression in a waterflood. Without knowledge of this gradual change, a profile obtained several years after the start of injection might appear sufficiently different from the initial profile to lead to an erroneous conclusion that channeling had developed or that some other drastic change had taken place.

The most likely causes of the high injection rate are leaks in the tubing, casing, or packer, or channeling to another zone. Fracturing is not a likely cause because the similarly completed surrounding injectors have the same wellhead pressure, yet do not exhibit abnormally high rate. Another unlikely, but possible, cause is that all the surrounding injection wells are damaged to similar extents, while the high-rate well is relatively undamaged.

A combination of a temperature and a noise log would be a good choice to attempt to locate the suspected leak or channel.

The small increase in noise amplitude at about 9140 ft could be due to flow through a restriction in a channel or flow through a casing leak.

The first subsection briefly describes rate transient analysis primarily for estimation of the well expected ultimate recovery (EUR).

Pressure and rate transient analysis based on geometric flow regimes that enable estimation of key parameters of interest to production engineering including the formation pore pressure, horizontal and vertical permeability values, damage skin, hydraulic fracture conductivity and half-length, and the well drainage pore volume.

There are only five flow regimes critical to production engineering: radial, spherical, linear, bilinear, and compression/expansion flow.

Describes analysis of flow regimes found in fracture calibration tests that enable estimation of reservoir permeability along with the minimum stress, fluid leakoff coefficient, and fluid efficiency needed for hydraulic fracture treatment design.

The rate function can be integrated over time to determine the cumulative production up until the time the well reaches the economic limit rate. The resulting cumulative production is called the expected ultimate recovery, or the EUR.

In reality exponential decline is the expected rate behavior for single-phase production from a well that is produced with a constant bottomhole pressure once the well has reached pseudosteady state flow. Since constant bottomhole pressure is a common production condition, exponential decline is frequently observed in conventional oil and gas wells. Harmonic and hyperbolic decline behaviors seem to be associated with flow below bubble or dew point pressure.

We must consider the impact of the well completion on the behavior of the rate decline before the onset of pseudosteady state. Generally, the rate will decline faster in stimulated wells, but it will start from a higher initial rate.

The formation test (Moran and Finklea, 1962) is not a well test.

The wireline formation test is typically performed in a mud-filled open hole. Hydraulically operated arms press against one side of the borehole, forcing the testing device against the opposing side. A doughnut-shaped rubber packer provides a seal, inside which a probe is forced into the formation. When exposed to low pressure, reservoir fluids flow into the tool. When a valve is shut, flow stops and a buildup occurs. Because the flow is only for a few seconds or minutes, the pressure builds up to the reservoir pressure in a short period of time. The test radius of investigation is at most only a few feet, but unlike in most well tests, the pressure disturbance expands spherically, not radially.

The test radius of investigation is at most only a few feet, but unlike in most well tests, the pressure disturbance expands spherically, not radially. This test is repeated at successive locations, providing a measure of reservoir pressure versus depth.

Conducted on a newly drilled well, the pressure measurements represent the static pressure profile with depth for the area in hydraulic communication with the well horizontally.

This option, which is analogous to a mini drill stem test, extends the test radius of investigation, thus enabling determination of more representative permeability values.

One application for this option is determination of the formation minimum stress by creating a microfracture.

Such measurements are very useful in predicting hydraulic fracture height migration and containment.

The formation test tool also includes a device that senses the phase of fluids withdrawn from the reservoir so that representative samples of reservoir fluids can be obtained, and multiple chambers are available that permit collection of pressurized downhole fluid samples at more than one depth in a logging trip. Formation fluid properties can sometimes be determined at the wellsite, and samples can also be sent to a PVT laboratory for more rigorous analysis.

Formation pressure measurements may show clearer indications of vertical and/or areal barriers in wells drilled after the field is put on production and differential depletion effects have become evident in the pressure data.

The high conductivity interval is produced with less pressure drop in the wellbore than in the other(s), which remain at a much higher pressure. Whenever.

The high conductivity interval is produced with less pressure drop in the wellbore than in the other(s), which remain at a much higher pressure. Whenever a well with differential depletion among commingled units is shut in, fluids flow from the higher-pressure intervals into the more depleted zones, resulting in wellbore crossflow, also called backflow.

Permeability and pressure determination combined with downhole fluid sampling have enabled wireline testing to achieve functions that were once only performed by drill stem tests.

When a production well is shut in, the downhole pressure builds up, as seen in Figure 13-20. Pressure buildup data can be acquired any time flow from the well is stopped, whether for the purpose of a test or for other operational reasons, provided there is a pressure guage available to sense time-dependent pressure changes and either transmit the pressure measurements in real time or record them in memory for later retrieval.

Neither permeability nor skin can be quantified from the productivity index determined from a stabilized flow test unless the other is known from some other measurement.

Most pressure transient data are interpreted when the well is not flowing as either a pressure buildup in a producing well or a pressure falloff in an injection well.

In the log–log diagnostic plot, the upper curve is pressure change, and the lower curve is the pressure change derivative.

When the well is hydraulically fractured or horizontal, the pressure penetrates from the extended wellbore, which itself may extend several thousand feet.

Two common production data analysis methods that can be used to estimate well and reservoir parameters are rate-normalized pressure (reciprocal productivity index) and pressure-normalized rate (productivity index).

The rate used for qref to keep the RNP in pressure units is a matter of convention.

RNP is interpreted as a virtual drawdown at constant rate.

The integral of RNP (IRNP) is computed as.

The advantage of production data is that it is collected for a much longer time than pressure buildup data, which is only available whenever the well is shut.

The flow geometries are called flow regimes.

When pressure behavior is dominated by a particular flow regime, it is possible to compute permeability in the direction of flow and dimensions of flow geometry.

The radial flow regime is the most strategic of all the flow regimes because it enables estimation of the permeability parallel to the bedding plane.

Permeability is actually directionally dependent, and the permeability value in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is often significantly less than the permeability parallel to the bedding plane.

The term reservoir permeability is the permeability value in the direction parallel to the bedding plane, and this is often called horizontal permeability even though the bedding plane may be dipping. Likewise,.

The term reservoir permeability is the permeability value in the direction parallel to the bedding plane, and this is often called horizontal permeability even though the bedding plane may be dipping. Likewise, the permeability value for the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane is called vertical permeability. When there is significant variation in permeability for different directions, this is called permeability anisotropy.

Wellbore storage, so called because in early time most pressure transient tests show behavior dominated by expansion and/or redistribution of wellbore fluids. At the beginning of the wellbore storage transient, both pressure and derivative may be overlain in a straight trend with unit slope.

For pressure buildup during this time the sandface rate changes from the flow rate before the buildup to zero.

After the sandface rate is zero, the observed pressure change and derivative are dominated by pressure transient behavior in the reservoir.

Wellbore storage behavior can be complex and may exhibit changing wellbore storage due to redistribution of wellbore fluid phases. For oil wells, as gas bubbles migrate upward in the wellbore, the average compressibility of the wellbore fluids increases, causing an increasing effective wellbore storage coefficient. In gas wells, gas condensate droplets dropping in the well-bore cause a decrease in the effective wellbore storage coefficient. It is very important to be able to distinguish wellbore storage transients from reservoir behavior.

Matching pressure transient data with a global model accounting for all parameters provides more accurate parameter estimates than analysis by individual flow regimes. Typically the global model is found using a least-square regression calculation such as would be provided in commercial software for pressure transient test analysis. However, more often than not flow regime estimates are quite close and serve as good starting values for the least-square regression calculation.

This condition is often intentional, or it can occur unintentionally when severe formation or perforation damage prevents flow to the well along a portion of the productive interval.

This condition is often intentional, or it can occur unintentionally when severe formation or perforation damage prevents flow to the well along a portion of the productive interval. Limited entry is called partial completion when only a portion of the cased and cemented completion is perforated.

As more and more wells install permanent downhole pressure gauges, buildup tests are becoming increasingly common.

Knowing how to estimate parameters from the log–log diagnostic plot is a skill worth mastering.

The flow regime is named pseudolinear because true linear flow occurs only when the flow streamlines are strictly normal to a planar source, and this only occurs when the vertical fracture half-length is equal to the width of the well drainage area.

Pseudoradial flow appears only when the effective wellbore radius is less than 1/10 of the well effective drainage radius.

After sufficient time on production, the well will reach either steady-state or pseudosteady-state flow.

For unconventional reservoirs with very low permeability, the time to reach pseudoradial, pseudo-steady, or steady-state flow may be very long.

If the well spacing is not sufficiently small, the well may remain in the fractured dominated pseudolinear or bilinear flow regime for its entire life.

In low-permeability formations, it is often impossible to determine permeability from a conventional pretreatment buildup test because flow to the well cannot occur without hydraulic fracture stimulation.

The examples in the previous section show how challenging it can be to determine permeability after the hydraulic fracture treatment and how long it can take to determine permeability from production data.

The fracture calibration injection falloff test, commercially called a mini-frac or a diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT), offers a way to estimate the formation permeability and pressure before the main hydraulic fracture treatment, even in very low-permeability formations.

Injecting the fracture fluid intended for the main fracture treatment at a pressure high enough to open a fracture in the formation creates an unpropped fracture. When injection stops, the unpropped fracture closes. The transient pressure behavior observed in the pressure falloff after the end of the injection enables quantification of the following three parameters: • Formation closure stress, which corresponds to an average value along the lithological profile of the minimum principle in-situ stress • Fracture fluid leakoff coefficient, CL • Fracture fluid efficiency, η Chapter 17 indicates how these parameters.

These parameters are determined from the pressure falloff behavior observed up until the created fracture closes. If the pressure falloff is allowed to continue long enough after the fracture closure is observed, it is possible also to determine the formation permeability and pressure. Analysis of the falloff behavior observed after the fracture closes is called after-closure analysis (ACA).

Injection of the same type of fluid to be used for the main treatment pressurizes the formation until the rock breakdown is achieved.

Injection of the same type of fluid to be used for the main treatment pressurizes the formation until the rock breakdown is achieved. After breakdown the fracture propagates until the pumps are shut down. At this point the pressure falls off. An instantaneous decrease in pressure to the value labeled as ISIP (instantaneous shut-in pressure) is due to friction losses. The instantaneous pressure drop is generally quite large if pressure is recorded at the wellhead, but when bottomhole pressure is recorded, the instantaneous pressure drop is mainly due to pressure losses in the near wellbore area.

Since during propagation the pressure gradient inside the fracture is negligible, the propagated fracture has effectively infinite conductivity.

While they are not estimated from standard pressure transient analysis, the closure stress, leakoff coefficient, and fracture fluid efficiency are critical inputs for main treatment hydraulic fracture design.

Matrix acidizing is a well stimulation technique in which an acid solution is injected into the formation in order to dissolve some of the minerals present, and hence recover or increase the permeability in the near-wellbore vicinity.

The most common acids used are hydrochloric acid (HCl), used primarily to dissolve carbonate minerals, and mixtures of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids (HF/HCl), for attacking silicate minerals such as clays and feldspars. Because traditional drilling fluid (drilling “mud”) was a suspension of bentonite clay, the mixture HF/HCl, effective in dissolving bentonite particles, has been known in the vernacular as mud acid.

The most common acids used are hydrochloric acid (HCl), used primarily to dissolve carbonate minerals, and mixtures of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids (HF/HCl), for attacking silicate minerals such as clays and feldspars.

Matrix acidizing is a near-wellbore treatment, with all of the acid reacting within about a foot of the wellbore in sandstone formations, and within a few to perhaps as much as 10–20 ft of the wellbore in carbonates.

An acidizing treatment is called a “matrix” treatment because the acid is injected at pressures below the parting pressure of the formation, so that fractures are not created. The objective is to greatly enhance or recover the permeability very near the wellbore, rather than affect a large portion of the reservoir.

Acid fracturing, resulting from the injection of fluids at pressure above the fracturing pressure of the formation, is intended to create a path of high conductivity by dissolving the walls of the fracture in a nonuniform way. Therefore, for the petroleum production engineer, acid fracturing has more in common with proppant fracturing than with matrix acidizing. Acid fracturing is sometimes used to overcome formation damage in relatively high-permeability formations. However, carbonate reservoirs of relatively low permeability may also be candidates for acid fracturing. For such reservoirs, a comparison with propped fracturing must be done, taking into account the expected post-treatment production rate versus costs.

In sandstone reservoirs, matrix acidizing should generally be applied only when a well has a high skin effect that cannot be attributed to partial penetration, perforation efficiency, or other mechanical aspects of the completion.

This 1-ft acid penetration distance is typical of what occurs in sandstone acidizing.

This example illustrates that matrix acidizing is primarily beneficial in removing damage when the depth of live acid penetration is shallow. For lower-permeability sandstone reservoirs, significant simulation of undamaged wells is generally possible only with hydraulic fracturing. Acid can penetrate deep enough in carbonate reservoirs to make matrix stimulation of these reservoirs beneficial, even with no damage present.

Stoichiometry The amount of acid needed to dissolve a given amount of mineral is determined by the stoichiometry of.

The amount of acid needed to dissolve a given amount of mineral is determined by the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction, which describes the number of moles of each species involved in the reaction.

A complication is that the fluosilicates may exist in various forms (Bryant, 1991), so that the total amount of HF required to dissolve a given amount of quartz depends on the solution concentration.

For the reactions between HF and feldspars, for example, the primary reactions predict that 14 moles of HF are needed to consume one mole of feldspar.

If only the primary reaction occurs, 32 moles of HF are consumed in dissolving one mole of kaolinite. However, if the secondary reaction proceeds to completion, the net consumption of HF per mole of kaolinite is only 20/3 because the fluosilicic acid produced in the primary reaction would consume two more moles of kaolinite and also produce 12 moles of HF.

A more convenient way to express reaction stoichiometry is with the dissolving power,.

The dissolving power expresses the amount of mineral that can be consumed by a given amount of acid on a mass or volume basis. First, the gravimetric dissolving power, β, the mass of mineral consumed by a given mass of acid, is defined as.

The dissolving power of any other concentration of acid is the β100 times the weight fraction of acid in the acid solution. For the commonly used 15 wt%.

The volumetric dissolving power, χ, similarly defined as the volume of mineral dissolved by a given volume of acid solution, is related to the gravimetric dissolving power by.

These dissolving powers assume complete reaction between the acid and the dissolving mineral species. However, the reactions of weak acids with carbonate minerals is often limited by the equilibrium between the reactants and the reaction products.

This equilibrium limitation decreases the dissolving power of weak acids.

Acid–mineral reactions are termed “heterogeneous” reactions because they are reactions between species occurring at the interface between different phases, the aqueous phase acid and the solid mineral.

The overall rate of acid consumption or mineral dissolution will depend on two distinct phenomena: the rate of transport of acid to the mineral surface by diffusion or convection, and the actual reaction rate on the mineral surface.

Surface reaction rates (reaction kinetics) are discussed in this section, while acid transport is detailed.

On the other hand, the surface reaction rates for many HF–mineral reactions are very slow compared with the acid transport rate, and the overall rate of acid consumption or mineral dissolution is reaction rate controlled.

For example, the reaction rate for the HCl-CaCO3 reaction is extremely high, so the overall rate of this reaction is usually controlled by the rate of acid transport to the surface, the slower of the two processes.

A reaction rate is generally defined as the rate of appearance in the solution of the species of interest in units of moles per second. A surface reaction rate depends on the amount of surface exposed to reaction, so these reactions are expressed on a per-unit surface area basis.

RA is the rate of appearance of A (moles/sec), rA is the surface area–specific reaction rate of A (moles/sec-m2), and SB is the surface area of mineral B. When A is being consumed, the reaction rates, rA and RA, are negative.

In order to measure the surface reaction rate of acid–mineral reactions, it is necessary to maintain a constant mineral surface area or measure its change during reaction, and to ensure that the rate of acid transport to the mineral surface is fast relative to the reaction rate.

Well-stirred slurry of mineral particles suspended in an acid solution (a stirred reactor) and with a rotating-disk apparatus.

In the rotating-disk apparatus, a disk of the mineral is placed in a large container holding the acid solution. The disk is rotated rapidly, so that the acid mass transfer rate is high relative to the surface reaction rate.

A third, more indirect method is by matching the core flood response to acidizing with a model of the process of flow with reaction. This.

For the feldspar reactions, the reaction rate increases with increasing HCl concentration, even though HCl is not consumed in the reaction.

Hr. Since feldspar is one of the faster-reacting constituents of sandstone, this indicates that the reaction rates in sandstone acidizing are quite small.

When the surface reaction rate is high, the overall rate of consumption of acid and dissolution of minerals will be controlled by the rate of acid transport to the mineral surfaces.

Acid is transported to the mineral surface by diffusion and by convection. The diffusional flux of acid is given by Fick’s law,.

A major concern in acidizing, particularly acidizing of sandstones, is damage caused by the precipitation of acid–mineral reaction products.

The most common damaging precipitates that may form in sandstone acidizing are calcium fluoride, CaF2; colloidal silica, Si(OH)4; ferric hydroxide, Fe(OH)3; and asphaltene sludges.

However, laboratory core floods suggest that the precipitation is not instantaneous and in fact may occur at a fairly slow rate (Shaughnessy and Kunze, 1981). To minimize the damage caused by colloidal silica, it is probably advantageous to inject at relatively high rates, so that the potential precipitation zone is rapidly displaced away from the wellbore. Also, spent acid should be produced back immediately after the completion of injection, since shutting in the well for even a relatively short time may allow significant silica precipitation to occur in the near-well vicinity.

Finally, in some reservoirs, contacting the crude oil by acid can cause the formation of asphaltenic sludges. Simple bottle tests in which a sample of crude oil is mixed with the acid can indicate whether the crude has a tendency for sludge formation when contacted by acid. When sludge formation is a problem, emulsions of acid in aromatic solvents or surface-active additives have been used to prevent asphaltene precipitation.

The first step in the planning of any matrix acidizing treatment for a sandstone formation should be a careful analysis of the cause(s) of impaired well performance.

This analysis should begin with the measurement of the well skin effect.

For highly deviated wells, there is a negative skin effect contribution from the extra exposure to the reservoir.

When a large positive skin effect is present, sources of mechanical skin (partial penetration, perforation skin, etc.) should be investigated,.

If mechanical effects do not explain the flow impairment, formation damage is indicated.

In general, damage due to drilling mud invasion or fines migration can be successfully treated with acid.

Typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products.

Typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products. A sandstone acidizing treatment design begins with the selection of the type and concentration of acid.

Once acid-treatable formation damage has been identified as the cause of poor well productivity, acidizing treatment design can begin. A typical acid treatment in sandstones consists of the injection of an HCl preflush, with 50 gal/ft of formation being a common preflush volume, followed by the injection of 50–200 gal/ft of HF/HCl mixture. A post-flush of diesel, brine, or HCl then displaces the HF/HCl from the tubing or wellbore. Once the treatment is completed, the spent acid should be immediately produced back to minimize damage by the precipitation of reaction products.

A sandstone acidizing treatment design begins with the selection of the type and concentration of acid to be used. The volume of preflush, HF/HCl mixture, and post-flush required, and the desired injection rate(s), are considered next. In virtually all acid treatments, the placement of the acid is an important issue—a strategy to ensure that sufficient volumes of acid contact all productive parts of the formation should be carefully planned.

The type and strength (concentration) of acid used in sandstones or carbonates is selected based primarily on field experience with particular formations.

For years, the standard treatments consisted of 15 wt% HCl for carbonate formations and a 3 wt% HF, 12 wt% HCl mixture, preceded by a 15 wt% HCl preflush, for sandstones.

The benefits of lower-concentration HF solutions are the reduction in damaging precipitates from the spent acid and lessened risk of unconsolidation of the formation around the well-bore.

These curves show that a lower-strength HF solution yields less damage in the early stages of injection; a conservative treatment design would select this low concentration as the best choice of those tested.

The obvious goal of a sandstone acidizing treatment is to remove near-wellbore formation damage. A less obvious but equally important goal is to minimize the damage caused by the acidizing process itself.

Such a slow rate may allow precipitates to form from the spent acid very near the perforations, reducing the overall effectiveness of the acid. Thus, what may be an optimal rate based only on the dissolution of minerals in the damaged zone may be less than optimum when the overall acidizing process is considered.

The volume of acid that is needed depends strongly on the depth of the damaged zone, and this depth is seldom known with any accuracy. With an assumption being made about the depth of the damaged zone, an optimal volume for a particular location in the well may be selected based on a laboratory acid response curve or an acidizing model.

To ensure that an adequate amount of acid contacts most of the formation, a larger amount of acid may be necessary, depending mainly on the techniques used for proper acid placement.

A very common application of acidizing in sandstones is to remove the damage caused by the invasion of drilling mud into the formation. When damage is caused by the invasion of HF-soluble solids like bentonite clay, an acidizing treatment is a very effective method of increasing well productivity if the damage is not too deep. The amount of acid needed depends strongly on the depth of the bentonite damage.

The simplest extension of the two-mineral model is to include the reaction of fluosilicic acid with the lumped fast-reacting minerals, which also requires explicit consideration of the precipitation.

Possible damaging precipitates. The two-acid, three-mineral model suggests that using the two-mineral model for predicting required acid volumes will be a conservative approach, particularly.

The two-acid, three-mineral model considers the precipitation of silica gel in its description of the acidizing process. However, there are other reaction products that may precipitate. The tendency for reaction product precipitation has been studied with comprehensive geochemical models that consider a large number of possible reactions that may take place in sandstone acidizing.

The permeability increases as pores and pore throats are enlarged by mineral dissolution. At the same time, small particles are released as cementing material is dissolved, and some of these particles will lodge (perhaps temporarily) in pore throats, reducing the permeability. Any precipitates formed will also tend to decrease.

The permeability increases as pores and pore throats are enlarged by mineral dissolution. At the same time, small particles are released as cementing material is dissolved, and some of these particles will lodge (perhaps temporarily) in pore throats, reducing the permeability. Any precipitates formed will also tend to decrease the permeability. The formation of CO2 as carbonate minerals are dissolved may also cause a temporary reduction in the relative permeability to liquids. The result of these competing effects is that the permeability in core floods usually decreases initially; with continued acid injection, the permeability eventually increases to values considerably higher than the original permeability.

Results with the two-acid, three-mineral model have shown that acidizing efficiency is relatively insensitive to injection rate, and that the highest rate possible yields the best results.

It is likely that the success of Paccaloni’s “maximum Δp, maximum rate” procedure is due to improved acid coverage (discussed in the next section) and the minimization of precipitation damage. Unless experience in a particular area suggests otherwise, Paccaloni’s maximum Δp, maximum rate procedure is recommended and is described here.

There is always an upper bound on injection rate, since, to ensure a matrix treatment, the injection rate must be kept below the rate that will cause hydraulic fracture formation. The bottomhole pressure that will initiate a fracture (the breakdown pressure).

Most commonly, only the surface rate and tubing pressure are monitored during an acid job,.

As the skin effect decreases during acidizing, a higher injection rate is possible without fracturing the formation. To ensure that fracturing does not occur, it is usually recommended that the surface tubing pressure be maintained about 10% below the pressure that would initiate fracturing. For this well, a prudent design would begin with an injection rate of 0.1 bpm, which could be increased while keeping the surface pressure below 2000 psi.

(1) The acid should be injected at the maximum rate and hence, maximum pwf possible without fracturing the formation; and (2) the treatment should be monitored in real time to ensure that the maximum rate objective is being met and to determine when sufficient acid has been injected into the formation.

As the treatment proceeds, the wellhead pressure is plotted against the injection rate and the evolving skin effect can be read from the graph. The fracture pressure versus injection rate is also plotted on this graph, so that the rate can be held at the highest possible value without fracturing the formation.

A drawback to Paccaloni’s method is that it will tend to overestimate the skin effect because it neglects transient flow effects, as pointed out by Prouvost and Economides (1988) and confirmed by Paccaloni and Tambini.

Linear relationship between inverse injectivity, Δp/q, and a time function) for gas.

When the reservoir pressure is high enough, gas viscosity, μ, and compressibility, Z, are directly proportional to pressure, and the pressure transient flow equation for a constant flow rate can.

This effect on the injection pressure of a bank of fluid of one viscosity displacing a fluid of another can be accounted for with an apparent viscous skin factor,.

Because the viscosity of the injected acid.

Because the viscosity of the injected acid is typically many times larger than the viscosity of the gas being displaced, the apparent viscous skin factor can be quite large.

On the other hand, when acidizing oil wells, because the viscosity of the oil is often similar to the viscosity of the acid or larger, the viscous skin factor is small, and will be negative when oil viscosity is greater than acid viscosity.

Treatment is proper placement of the acid so that all of the productive intervals are contacted by sufficient volumes of acid. If there are significant variations in reservoir permeability, the acid will tend to flow primarily into the highest-permeability zones, leaving lower-permeability zones virtually untreated. Even in relatively homogeneous formations, the damage may not be distributed uniformly; without the use of techniques to improve the acid placement, much of the damage may be left untreated. Thus the distribution of the acid into the formation is a very important consideration in matrix acidizing, and a treatment design should include plans for acid placement.

The surest method for obtaining uniform acid placement is to isolate individual zones mechanically and treat all zones successively. Mechanical isolation can be accomplished with an opposed cup packer (perforation wash tool), the combination of a squeeze packer and a retrievable bridge plug, or inflatable straddle packers.

Ball sealers are rubber-coated balls that are designed to seat in the perforations in the casing, thereby diverting injected fluid to other perforations.

Most commonly, ball sealers are more dense than the treating fluid, so that after treatment, the ball sealers will fall into the rathole.

A common method of improving placement in matrix acidizing treatments is through the use of particulate diverting agents. Particulate diverting agents are fine particles that form a relatively low-permeability filter cake on the formation face. The pressure drop through this filter cake increases the flow resistance, diverting the acid to other parts of the formation where less diverting agent has been deposited. Diverting agents are either added to the treating fluid continuously, or in batches between stages of acid.

The presence of diverting agents complicates the diagnosis of acid treatments because the diverting agent is continuously adding a pressure drop at the wellbore. Simultaneously, the acid is removing damage, decreasing the flow resistance near the wellbore. These two effects can be properly accounted for only with a comprehensive acidizing model, such as that presented by Taha et al. (1989). However, approximate models of the overall process can be helpful in designing diversion and interpreting the effect of diversion on the real-time rate/pressure behavior during an acid treatment.

As acidizing proceeds, the skin effect will decrease until the damage has been almost entirely removed. After this point has been reached, the skin effect will change very slowly and can be approximated as being zero. The volume of acid needed to reduce the skin effect to zero can be estimated based on an acidizing model,.

Gels, foamed acid, and viscoelastic surfactant solutions are being used increasingly as a means of improving acid placement. With these fluids, the mechanism of diversion is viscous diversion, the increase in flow resistance in higher-permeability regions due to the presence of a bank of viscous fluid.

Before the HF/HCl mixture is injected in a sandstone acidizing treatment, a preflush of hydrochloric acid, most commonly a 15 wt% solution, is usually injected. The primary purpose of the preflush is to prevent the precipitation of species such as calcium fluoride when the HF solution contacts the formation. The HCl preflush accomplishes this by dissolving the carbonate minerals, displacing ions such as calcium and magnesium from the near-wellbore vicinity, and lowering the pH around the wellbore.

With HCl, the HF/HCl mixture can be injected without a preflush. In this instance, the objective is not to obtain an optimal stimulation treatment, but to remove enough damage to establish communication with.

In situations where injectivity cannot be established with HCl, the HF/HCl mixture can be injected without a preflush. In this instance, the objective is not to obtain an optimal stimulation treatment, but to remove enough damage to establish communication with the formation for testing purposes.

When the HCl solution enters the formation, it dissolves carbonate minerals rapidly but does not react to a great extent with other minerals. HCl does leach aluminum from clay minerals while not dissolving the entire clay molecule structure.

The preflush volume is selected by assuming a distance to which all carbonates should be removed by the preflush and then calculating the acid volume required.

After a sufficient volume of HF/HCl solution has been injected, it is displaced from the tubing and the wellbore with a postflush. A variety of fluids have been used for the post-flush, including diesel, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solutions, and HCl. The post-flush displaces the spent acid farther from the wellbore so that any precipitates that may form will be less damaging. As a minimum, the post-flush volume should be the volume of the tubing plus twice the volume of the wellbore below the tubing. Because of gravity segregation effects (Hong and Millhone, 1977), at least this much post-flush is needed to displace all acid from the wellbore.

Corrosion inhibitors, iron-sequestering compounds, surfactants, and mutual solvents. Acid additives should be tested carefully to ensure compatibility with other chemicals in the acid solution and with the formation fluids; only those that provide a clear benefit should be included in the treating fluids.

The corrosion inhibitors used are organic compounds containing polar groups that are attracted to the metal surface. Corrosion inhibitors are usually proprietary formulations, so it is the responsibility of the service company supplying the acid to recommend the type and concentration of corrosion inhibitor to be used in a particular acid treatment.

An iron-sequestering compound, usually EDTA, is sometimes added to acid solutions when it is thought that ferric ions (Fe3+) are present in the near-wellbore region in order to prevent the precipitation of Fe(OH)3 in the spent acid solution.

Surfactants are added to acid solutions to prevent the formation of emulsions, to speed cleanup of spent acid, and to prevent sludge formation. Like sequestering agents, surfactants may have deleterious effects on the formation and should be used only after careful testing with the formation fluids and core samples.

A mutual solvent is added to the post-flush—it improves productivity apparently by removing corrosion inhibitor that has absorbed on formation surfaces (Crowe and Minor, 1985) and by restoring water-wet conditions.

All solutions to be injected should be tested to ensure that they conform to the design formulations; (2) all necessary steps should be taken to minimize the damage caused by the acidizing process itself; and (3) the acidizing process should be monitored by measuring the rate and pressure (surface and/or bottomhole). McLeod (1984), Brannon et al. (1987), Paccaloni and Tambini (1988), and numerous others have clearly shown the importance of these guidelines.

Before an acidizing treatment in a sandstone formation is undertaken, there should be a clear indication that low well productivity is due, at least in part, to acid-soluble formation damage. This can be determined through a pretreatment pressure transient test to measure the skin effect, an analysis of other possible sources of skin, as shown in Chapter 6, and an assessment of the source of formation damage. A prestimulation production log is also helpful in some cases in planning the treatment and as a baseline for post-treatment analysis.

Surface equipment can be cleaned prior to being brought to the location or on site with the acid solution itself. If the production tubing is to be used for acid injection, an HCl solution or other cleaning fluids should be circulated down the tubing and back to the surface before injection into the formation begins. This process is called tubing pickling.

Or bottomhole pressure should be monitored. The real-time monitoring discussed in this chapter can then be applied to optimize the treatment. Occasional.

During the treatment, the injection rate and surface or bottomhole pressure should be monitored. The real-time monitoring discussed in this chapter can then be applied to optimize the treatment.

Be an important diagnostic aid. When acid injection has been completed, the well should be flowed back immediately to minimize damage by reaction product precipitation.

In a clastic formation, the surface reaction rates are slow and a relatively uniform acid front moves through the porous medium.

In carbonates, surface reaction rates are very high, so mass transfer often limits the overall reaction rate, leading to highly nonuniform dissolution patterns. Often, a few large channels, called wormholes, are created,.

The structure of these wormhole patterns depends on many factors, including (but not limited to) flow geometry, injection rate, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer rates.

Since wormholes are much larger than the pores in nonvuggy carbonates, the pressure drop through the region penetrated by wormholes is small and can often be neglected.

Thus, in matrix acidizing, knowledge of the depth of penetration of wormholes allows a prediction of the effect of acidizing on the skin effect.

The objective of a carbonate acidizing treatment is to create wormholes penetrating deep enough into the formation to bypass any damaged region and, often, to create a significantly negative skin factor.

Thus, unlike sandstone acidizing where the objective is to overcome formation damage effects, matrix stimulation of carbonates creates sufficient productivity enhancement to make it an attractive procedure even in the absence of formation damage. For this reason, and because of its simplicity and relatively low cost, most wells in carbonate formations are acid stimulated.

Strong acid solutions, usually viscosified by adding polymers or creating emulsions, are injected at pressures.

Acid fracturing is a stimulation method in which strong acid solutions, usually viscosified by adding polymers or creating emulsions, are injected at pressures above the fracturing pressure.

Depending primarily on rock characteristics, in some formations, acid fracturing is a cost-effective way to create a conductive hydraulic fracture.

Wormholes form in a dissolution process when the large pores grow at a rate substantially higher than the rate at which smaller pores grow, so that a large pore receives an increasingly larger proportion of the dissolving fluid, eventually becoming a wormhole.

Mass transfer-limited reactions.

Surface reaction rate-limited reactions.

The kinetics are mixed, and both surface reaction rate and mass transfer rate are important.

The natural tendency for wormholes to form when reaction is mass transfer limited has been demonstrated theoretically by Schechter and Gidley.

And 16-2. Thus, whether or not wormholes will form, and the structure of the wormholes that do form, depend on the relative rates of surface reaction, diffusion, and fluid loss, all of which depend on the overall convection rate of the acid.

For a given rock, acid system, and temperature, a progression of dissolution patterns occur as injection rate is increased. The typical dissolution patterns created when HCl.

Thus, the key to most efficient acid stimulation is to design an acid system that can be injected into the well at flow rates that would lead to dominant wormholing.

The progression presented here depends on the relative magnitudes of the diffusion and surface reaction rates and also on the flow geometry because of the role of fluid loss from the wormholes.

When the flow rate is below the optimum, the volume of acid needed to propagate a wormhole a certain distance decreases rapidly as the injection rate increases, but when the wormhole propagation is above the optimal, the volume of acid required increases only gradually with increasing injection rate. This means that it is better to inject at a rate above the optimum than at too low a rate.

With a lower reaction rate, substantially more acid is needed to propagate a wormhole a given distance,.

Hydrochloric acid is by far the most common acid used in carbonate matrix acidizing. Table 16-1 shows the acids suggested by McLeod (1984) for various acid treatments of carbonate formations. Weak acids are suggested for perforation cleanup and perforating fluid, but otherwise, strong solutions of HCl are recommended.

For a matrix treatment, HCl should be used unless corrosion considerations require a weaker acid (this would occur only in deep, hot wells).

All models of wormhole propagation predict deeper penetration for higher acid concentrations, so a high concentration of HCl is preferable.

Also, in carbonates, there are usually no precipitation reactions to limit the acid concentrations used, as is the case in sandstones. However, if sulfate-rich water, such as seawater, is used to mix the acid solution, or is used in conjunction with acid injection as a spacer, preflush, or post-flush fluid, precipitation of CaSO4 may occur and cause formation damage.

60°C. If the well injectivity does not allow a flux that is near the optimal or above for a strong acid solution, it may be advantageous to use a weaker acid, such as acetic acid,.

60°C. If the well injectivity does not allow a flux that is near the optimal or above for a strong acid solution, it may be advantageous to use a weaker acid, such as acetic acid, because the optimal flux for the weaker acid is lower.

The volume of acid to be injected in carbonate acidizing is based on the desired level of stimulation to be achieved. The more acid injected, the deeper into the formation wormholes propagate, and the lower the created skin factor.

The injection rate schedule for a carbonate acidizing treatment is a very important design variable because of the sensitivity of the wormholing process to the flux of acid into the unstimulated rock ahead of the dissolution front. However, once an acid system has been selected, the best rate schedule is to simply inject at the highest rate possible without fracturing the formation,.

At injection rates below the optimum, wormholing becomes very inefficient, while at rates above the optimum, the efficiency decreases slowly with increased rate.

The higher injection rate causes more wormhole branching, but wormholes continue to propagate. Because of this trend, and the fact that optimal injection conditions cannot be precisely created in the field because of variability in injectivity along a well and other uncertainties, injecting at the highest rate possible is the best approach. This also means that as the well is stimulated and injectivity increases, the injection rate should be steadily increased.

A matrix acidizing treatment in a carbonate reservoir should be monitored by measuring the injection rate and pressure during injection, just as a sandstone acidizing treatment is monitored.

Carbonates are such large channels, it is generally assumed that the pressure drop through the wormhole region is negligible, so that the effect of the wormholes on the well skin effect is the same as enlarging the wellbore. With this assumption, the skin evolution in a carbonate matrix acidizing treatment can be predicted with the models of wormhole propagation.

Adequate placement of acid into all zones to be stimulated is as important in acidizing carbonates as it is in sandstones, and the same fluid placement techniques are applicable. However, because of the formation of wormholes, particulates should be used with caution because of potential difficulty in removing them. Viscous diversion is commonly used in carbonate acidizing, with viscosified acid systems including foamed acid, emulsified acid, and polymer-viscosified acid.

Viscoelastic surfactant acid systems are unique diverting materials in that these fluids have low viscosity until the acid spends, then the viscosity increases dramatically in the spent acid in which the calcium concentration and pH have both increased greatly.

Acid fracturing is a stimulation technique in which acid is injected at pressures above the parting pressure of the formation, so that a hydraulic fracture is created. Usually, a viscous pad fluid is injected ahead of the acid to initiate the fracture, then plain acid, gelled acid, foamed acid, or an emulsion containing acid is injected.

Thus, acid fracturing is an alternative to the use of proppants to create fracture conductivity after closure. The fracturing process itself is identical to that employed with proppant fracturing.

The primary issues to be addressed in designing an acid fracturing treatment are the penetration distance of live acid down the fracture, the conductivity created by the acid (and its distribution along the fracture), and the resulting productivity of an acid-fractured well. Since acid fracturing should be viewed as an alternative means of creating fracture conductivity in a carbonate formation, a comparison with proppant fracturing should generally be made when planning a possible acid fracturing treatment.

The conductivity (kfw) of an acid fracture is difficult to predict because it depends inherently on a stochastic process: If the walls of the fracture are not etched heterogeneously, very little fracture conductivity will result after closure.

The productivity of an acid-fractured well can be predicted in the same manner as for a well with a propped fracture (see Chapter 17 for details on propped fracture performance) if an average fracture conductivity adequately describes the well flow behavior. One complicating factor is that the conductivity of an acid fracture depends strongly on the closure stress, and the closure stress increases as the bottomhole.

The productivity of an acid-fractured well can be predicted in the same manner as for a well with a propped fracture (see Chapter 17 for details on propped fracture performance) if an average fracture conductivity adequately describes the well flow behavior. One complicating factor is that the conductivity of an acid fracture depends strongly on the closure stress, and the closure stress increases as the bottomhole flowing pressure decreases during the life of the well. Since pwf for a given flow rate depends on fracture conductivity and the fracture conductivity depends on the closure stress, and hence pwf, an iterative procedure is required to determine the productivity of an acid-fractured well.

The fact that acid fracturing is intended specifically for carbonate formations should not preclude the use of a propped fracture if it can be placed and has economic advantages.

Acid fractures will be relatively short and are by no means of infinite conductivity, particularly at high closure stress.

Horizontal wells present a distinct challenge for matrix acidizing, if for no other reason than simply because of the extent of the region to be acidized. To attempt to obtain the same acid coverage in a horizontal well with a length of, for example, 2000 ft, would require an acid volume and treating time much greater than that typically needed for vertical wells. Besides the much greater cost, corrosion inhibition during long periods of acid injection may limit the extent of matrix acidizing that is feasible in a horizontal well.

When fluid is pumped into the reservoir at a sufficiently high pressure, the reservoir rock will crack open. Continued pumping of the fluid at this pressure will propagate the crack into the reservoir. A slurry can be pumped into the crack to create a slab-shaped zone of high permeability known as a hydraulic fracture.

By 2012, hydraulic fracturing had emerged as a $20 billion annual activity, second only to drilling budgets in magnitude.

The hydraulic fracture design is highly dependent on the reservoir permeability.

The fracture accelerates production without impacting the well reserves.

In such reservoirs the rationale for fracturing frequently relies on net present value economics.

Low-permeability reservoirs (less than 1 md for oil and 0.01 md for gas), the hydraulic fracture greatly contributes both to well productivity and to the well reserves. More importantly, in such reservoirs the well would not produce an economic rate without the hydraulic fracture.

The concept of production and recovery acceleration, high-permeability reservoirs.

Production and reserves enhancement from hydraulic fracturing, low-permeability reservoirs.

Very low- and very high-permeability reservoirs pose additional challenges for hydraulic fracturing.

Very low permeability, such as tight gas and shale gas, the well drainage area is confined essentially to the stimulated reservoir volume created by multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells, as diagrammed in Figure 17-4. In very high permeability reservoirs,.

Very low permeability, such as tight gas and shale gas, the well drainage area is confined essentially to the stimulated reservoir volume created by multiple transverse hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells, as diagrammed in Figure 17-4. In very high permeability reservoirs, hydraulic fractures have a dual purpose—to stimulate the well and to provide sand control—and the latter justifies postponing much of the discussion of this strategy until.

Horizotal Well is drilled in parallel to direction of minimum principal stress.

What fracturing accomplishes is to alter the way the fluids enter the wellbore, changing from near-well radial flow to linear or bilinear flow.

Implies that the flow is from the reservoir into the fracture and then along the fracture into the well.

It should be noted here that a hydraulic fracture bypasses the near-wellbore damage zone. Thus, the pretreatment skin effect has little or no impact on the post-fracture equivalent skin effect value.

Suppose that a reservoir is depicted as a countryside and the fracture is a road connecting two far-off points. Where there is an excellent and dense system of wide roads (high-permeability-reservoir analog), relative improvement of the traffic flow would require even wider (more lanes) and faster freeways. This translates to high-permeability and wide fractures. Therefore, in moderate- to high-permeability reservoirs, a large fracture width is necessary, while the fracture length is of secondary importance.

Poor road system (low-permeability analog), a long road connecting as much of the countryside as possible.

Conversely, in a countryside with a sparse and poor road system (low-permeability analog), a long road connecting as much of the countryside as possible is indicated. Such a long road could bring about a major improvement in traffic flow. In fact, the poorer the existing road system, the lower the relative requirements would be from the new road. By analogy, the length of the fracture in a lower-permeability reservoir is the priority; fracture permeability and width are secondary. Thus, in designing a hydraulic fracture treatment, fracture length, width, and proppant pack permeability must be suited to the formation properties, especially formation permeability.

Every hydraulic fracture can be characterized by its length, conductivity, and related equivalent skin effect.

The created fracture length relates to the length of the crack propagated during the hydraulic fracture treatment execution. The conductive fracture length refers to the length of the fracture remaining open when the well is on production, thereby effectively providing an enhanced path for fluid production to the well.

The conductive length is assumed to consist of two equal half-lengths, xf, extending in opposite directions from the well. In the following definitions and in the remainder of this chapter and the following chapter, the term fracture length, denoted by xf, will always refer to the conductive fracture half length.

The fracture permeability, kf, and the fracture width, w.

The fracture conductivity is given by the product of the fracture permeability, kf, and the fracture width, w.

When the fracture half length approaches the effective radius of the well drainage area, the concepts of equivalent skin and effective well radius do not apply.

Radial and pseudoradial flow are also called infinite-acting radial flow and occur only as long as the radius of the pressure disturbance due to production is less than the distance to the nearest boundary of the well drainage area.

Such high conductivity fractures are said to have effectively infinite conductivity,.

Implies that in this case the reservoir drains to a well with an effective wellbore radius equal to half of the fracture half length.

Relate the dimensionless productivity index, JD, with the well skin effect for a vertical well under radial flow.

When pseudoradial flow emerges after fracture bilinear and/or linear flow, the skin determined from a pressure buildup test will be the equivalent skin effect indicated.

When the fracture height is greater than the reservoir height, h, a distinction must be made between the productive fracture height, h, equal to the reservoir height, and the propped fracture height, hf.

Thus, there exists only one optimum conductivity that maximizes the productivity index, and this conductivity corresponds to a particular fracture width and length.

Narrower fracture width would mean that the fracture becomes a bottleneck; shorter fracture length would mean that the reservoir becomes the bottleneck.

Fracture half length is sufficiently small compared to the well drainage area that pseudoradial flow can occur.

Because a given volume of proppant with a specified permeability was assumed, thereby fixing the proppant cost, this represents not just maximum productivity, but optimum productivity as well for the assumed proppant expenditure.

Key to this approach is the idea that for a given proppant volume and well drainage area and shape there is a fracture half length, width, and conductivity that maximize the well productivity.

Expands the above approach to include fracture and well drainage area dimensions that will not reach pseudoradial flow before the onset of pseudosteady state. Key to this approach is the idea that for a given proppant volume and well drainage area and shape there is a fracture half length, width, and conductivity that maximize the well productivity.

Since small proppant numbers would mean relatively small treatments or large drainages and thus fracture performance would reach pseudoradial flow before the onset of pseudosteady-state flow.

Figure 17-9), the fracture penetration approaches the drainage boundaries (Ix = 1 is a fully penetrating fracture) and the boundaries normal to the fracture plane force.

However, as the proppant number increases (Figure 17-9), the fracture penetration approaches the drainage boundaries (Ix = 1 is a fully penetrating fracture) and the boundaries normal to the fracture plane force the flow to remain linear or bilinear, both of which are far more efficient than radial, until eventually pseudosteady-state flow develops.

When the proppant number increases, due to increased propped volume or lower reservoir permeability, the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity also increases.

For hydraulically fractured wells in low-permeability reservoirs, the time required to reach the pseudosteady-state flow condition described in the previous sections can be long, sometimes even longer than the productive life of the well. The productivity of such wells is predicted using transient flow models or numerically generated type curves that describe the transient flow period. Commonly used models are based on idealizations of the flow regime as being bilinear flow, linear flow in the formation, or pseudoradial flow, as described in Chapter 13. These models are very useful in pressure transient test analysis, but are less helpful for production forecasting because of gaps in the periods of applicability of each model and inconsistent transitions.

If the fracture conductivity is sufficiently greater than the reservoir’s capacity to deliver fluid to the fracture, the pressure drop in the fracture is negligible, and the fracture is treated as having infinite conductivity.

When the fracture conductivity is too low for the infinite conductivity solutions to apply, type curves can be used to generate production forecast.

In many hydraulically fractured gas wells, the additional pressure drop caused by non-Darcy flow in the fracture itself causes lower productivity than would occur with Darcy flow.

For high-rate gas wells, a simple, conservative approach, as suggested by Gidley (1991), is to use the velocity at the wellbore to estimate the effects of non-Darcy flow on well productivity.

Because the non-Darcy flow effect is rate-dependent, the flow rate must be known to determine productivity, and the problem is iterative.

Non-Darcy effects have an additional impact in production optimization. Hydraulic fractures should be redesigned to have a larger width to accommodate the reduction in the effective proppant pack permeability. Thus, for a given mass of proppant the geometry of the fracture and the relationship between length and width must be adjusted depending on the magnitude of the non-Darcy effects. The UFD approach does this in a coherent fashion.

An increasing amount of oil and, more commonly, gas is being produced from very low—permeability formations, referred to as unconventional resources. Such reservoirs include tight gas sand and shale resources, which share the common feature that economic recovery of hydrocarbons requires fracture stimulation.

Advanced hydraulic fracture stimulation technology is the key to economically accessing these reserves, with the creation of multiple hydraulic fractures from either vertical or horizontal wells often required.

These reservoirs have permeabilities less than 0.1 md and as low as 0.001 md. To.

These reservoirs have permeabilities less than 0.1 md and as low as 0.001 md. To produce commercial quantities of gas, these reservoirs must be comprised of thick formations, or there must be multiple sand bodies that are penetrated by each well. A typical tight gas well is completed in very thick, stacked sands such as those of the Mesa Verde geological group in the Piceance Basin of the western United States. The braided stream deposits in this formation result in numerous isolated sand bodies distributed over as much as 5000 feet of gross vertical interval.

Reservoir simulators using a dual-porosity approach as has been applied for many years to simulate naturally fractured reservoirs are commonly used to forecast the performance of fractured shale wells. In this approach, one value of permeability is assigned to the matrix blocks, and another, higher permeability is assigned to the fracture network. It is also possible to have different conductivities in the main fractures compared with orthogonal, stimulated natural fractures.

A semi-analytical modeling approach for the multiple fracture production problem is to treat the fractures as containing collections of pressure sinks that are communicating with each other through the fractures and through the low-permeability formation. This approach typically requires some numerical method be applied, such as numerical inversion of an analytical solution in Laplace space.

The previous chapter presented methods to determine what sort of hydraulic fracture would optimize well performance for a given reservoir, and methods to forecast well performance for assumed fracture conditions.

Techniques needed to design and execute the hydraulic fracturing process to achieve the treatment goals. A fracturing treatment design begins with the desired fracture geometry and fracture conductivity. Then, appropriate fracture fluids and proppants are selected, and treatment volume, pumping schedule, and proppant loading schedule are designed to achieve the desired final fracture geometry.

Conventional, biwing fracture design and the planned creation of multiple fractures or, in some cases, the creation of multiple fractures coupled with activation of existing natural fractures.

Except for very low–permeability reservoirs, biwing fracture design procedures are appropriate.

For very low (microdarcy) and ultra-low (nanodarcy) reservoir permeabilities, the creation of high fracture density with multiple fractures is a critical part of the overall well completion and fracture treatment design.

Finally, in low-permeability reservoirs having low contrast in horizontal stress and preexisting natural fracture networks, such as some shale formations, the goal of fracturing is to create complex fracture networks as a combination of new hydraulic fractures and stimulated natural fractures.

The created fracture geometry (height, width, length, and azimuth) can be approximated for given pumping conditions using analytical 2-D models of fracture propagation. These models combine elastic fracture mechanics, fluid transport in the fracture, fluid leakoff from the fracture, and material balances on the fluid and the proppant to calculate the created fracture geometry and the resulting proppant distribution.

The fracture geometry created is tailored by selecting the most appropriate fracture fluids and proppants. The physical properties of fracture fluids and proppants that must be known for fracture design are also reviewed here. Finally, modern methods for diagnosing the fracture created, often applied in real time, are presented.

Execution of a hydraulic fracture involves the injection of fluids at a pressure sufficiently high to cause tensile failure of the rock.

At the fracture initiation pressure, often known as the “breakdown pressure,” the rock opens. As additional fluids are injected, the opening is extended and the fracture propagates.

A reservoir at depth is under a state of stress. This situation can be characterized by the stress vectors. In a geologically stable environment, three principal stresses can be identified. Their directions coincide with the directions where all shear stresses vanish. These are the vertical direction and two horizontal directions for minimum and maximum horizontal stresses.

A hydraulic fracture will be normal to the smallest of the three stresses because it will open and displace the rock against the least resistance.

In the vast majority of reservoirs to be hydraulically fractured, the minimum horizontal stress is the smallest, leading to vertical hydraulic fractures.

The direction (azimuth) of the hydraulic fracture plane will be perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction.

Stress, which corresponds to the weight of the overburden.

The most readily understood stress is the vertical stress, which corresponds to the weight of the overburden.

The vertical stress is translated horizontally through the Poisson relationship, which in its simplest expression has the form.

This stress is the absolute stress, and in the case of a porous medium, since the weight of the overburden will be carried by both the grains and the fluid within the pore space, the effective stress, , is defined.

Poisson ratio.

Where is the effective horizontal stress and v is the Poisson ratio. This variable is a rock property. For sandstones it is approximately equal to 0.25, implying that the effective horizontal stress is approximately one-third the effective vertical stress.

The absolute horizontal stress decreases with fluid production.

Fracture injection tests, known as “data fracs” or “minifracs,” and their analysis are employed for such measurements.

The magnitude of the breakdown pressure is characteristic of the values and the respective differences of the principal stresses, the tensile stress, and the reservoir pressure.

Since there will be a nonvanishing shear stress component.

Complex fracture geometries are likely to be encountered at depths greater than this level. Fractures may be initiated vertically but may turn horizontal (T-shape fractures) when (and if) the minimum stress plus the fracture net pressure exceed the overburden stress. A.

Complex fracture geometries are likely to be encountered at depths greater than this level. Fractures may be initiated vertically but may turn horizontal (T-shape fractures) when (and if) the minimum stress plus the fracture net pressure exceed the overburden stress. A T-shape geometry is invariably undesirable, since the width of the horizontal branch is very small, resulting in substantial fluid loss during propped fracture propagation, slurry dehydration, and “screenouts.” (A screenout is when there is not sufficient pressure to propagate the fracture because of extra resistance as the slurry cannot suspend the proppant.

Primary fracture propagates in the direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction, and hence in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress. The azimuthal direction of hydraulic fractures can.

A primary fracture propagates in the direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress direction, and hence in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress.

Van Everdingen and Hurst (1949) quantified the condition of the near-wellbore region with the introduction.

This is an interesting finding. In a damaged well, with, for example, s = 10, the reservoir drains into a well with an effective radius equal to 4.5 × 10–5 rw. Conversely,.

Fracture direction is normal to the minimum resistance. This is represented by the absolute minimum stress.

Fracture length much larger than the fracture height.

A wide variety of fluids have been used for fracturing, including water, aqueous solutions of polymers with or without crosslinkers, gelled oils, viscoelastic surfactant solutions, foams, and emulsions. The most common fluids used now are “slickwater”–water with a small amount of polymer added to reduce frictional pressure drop and solutions of the natural polymer guar, or its derivatives, particularly hydroxypropyl guar (HPG).

The fracture fluid serves to create the fracture and to transport the proppant.

High apparent viscosity is desirable to create greater fracture width, suspend the proppant as it is transported down the fracture, and minimize leakoff.

Low-viscosity fluids, on the other hand, can be pumped at a higher rate because of lower frictional pressure drop and can more easily penetrate into narrow secondary fractures created in complex fracturing of ultra-low-permeability formations.

Almost all desirable and undesirable properties of fracturing fluids are related to their apparent viscosity,.

Almost all desirable and undesirable properties of fracturing fluids are related to their apparent viscosity, which in turn is a function of the polymer load.

Most fracturing fluids are not Newtonian, and the most commonly used model to describe their rheological behavior is the power.

Most fracturing fluids are not Newtonian, and the most commonly used model to describe their rheological behavior is the power law.

Because of the high rate injection needed to create sufficient pressure to fracture the rock and to propagate hydraulic fractures deep into the reservoir, the frictional pressure drop caused by fracturing fluids is very important.

To minimize friction during flow down the well tubulars, most fracturing fluids contain polymers that reduce the frictional pressure drop caused by the fluid.

Slickwater fracture fluids contain low concentrations of polymers, most commonly polyacrylamide based, to reduce friction.

The purpose of the proppant is to provide a conductive pathway from the reservoir to the wellbore by keeping the fracture from closing once the high pressure applied to create the fracture is relieved.

Conductivity—The conductivity created by the proppant depends on the proppant mean size and size distribution, the proppant loading or concentration after closure (Cp), and the packing of the proppant.

Transportability—A desirable proppant can be transported far down a created hydraulic fracture. Because almost all proppants are considerably denser than the fracture fluids that carry them, proppant settling affects the ability to transport proppant down a fracture.

It is also important to consider that the closure stress depends on the pressure in the fracture,.

It is also important to consider that the closure stress depends on the pressure in the fracture, and thus is likely to increase over the life of a fractured well as declining reservoir pressure results in lower wellbore pressure.

The conductivity created by a proppant also depends on the size of the proppant, with larger proppant sizes creating higher-permeability proppant packs and hence, higher conductivities.

This increase is predicated on the proppant pack being undamaged, as finer particles added to larger size proppants can result in much lower conductivity.

The conductivity of propped fractures is very susceptible to reductions caused by invasion of smaller particles into the proppant pack, crushing of some of the proppant particles, embedment of the proppant into the fracture surfaces, permeability reduction caused by unbroken polymer gels from the fracture fluid, two-phase flow effects, and non-Darcy flow effects.

However, because almost all proppants are significantly denser than the fracturing fluid transporting them, the proppant will settle, and more proppant is deposited in the lower part of the created fracture. The rate of proppant settling in a power law fluid can be estimated.

Fracture diagnostic methods that are aimed at determining the geometry of the fracture or fractures created, often applied in real time, have contributed greatly to improvements in the fracturing process.

Monitoring the net pressure in real time is a routine part of hydraulic fracturing operations.

Diagnostic procedures have been developed to measure many aspects of the created fracture geometry, including height, length, and azimuth.

The primary techniques for monitoring fracture geometry are microseismic monitoring, tiltmeter monitoring, temperature profile measurements, and tracer methods.

Microseismic mapping is extensively used with shale fracturing to measure the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), the product of the area affected by complex fracturing and the height of the created fractures.

Another means of detecting the geometry of hydraulic fractures is measuring very small earth movements with inclinometers or tiltmeters.

As a fracture propagates, the formations around it are deformed, and these deformations can be detected with extremely sensitive measurements of the change in angle of a solid rod attached to the deforming surface.

Fracture characteristics, at least in the near well vicinity, have been diagnosed for many years using chemical or radioactive tracers and temperature profiles. By tagging fracture fluids and/or proppants with chemical markers or radioactive isotopes, the location where these tracers remain near the wellbore can then be detected with logging methods. King (2010) reviewed these tracer methods, particularly the use of multiple tracers to diagnose where fractures were created in multistage fracturing.

Because fracturing fluid is typically much cooler than the formation being fractured, the wellbore contiguous with the fracture is cooler than other parts of the wellbore and hence, a temperature log run shortly after a fractured well is shut in can identify the fractured interval as the location of a cool anomaly.

The combination of horizontal wellbores and multiple hydraulic fractures provides a means to maximize wellbore contact with a reservoir, and is crucial to economic development of lowpermeability reservoirs.

Unlike vertical well fracturing, most fracturing jobs in horizontal wells are aimed at creating multiple fractures, either by single-stage pumping or multistage pumping with isolation provided by the completion.

New challenges in horizontal well fracturing include, but are not limited to, orientation of horizontal wells for favorable stress fields to create the desired type of fractures, successfully propagating multiple fractures, less trips and effective isolation between fracturing stages, significantly larger volume of treatments, and creation of extremely complex fracture network systems in shale formations.

The main reason to create longitudinal fractures is to break the vertical barriers when a horizontal well is placed in a relatively thick formation with impermeable laminations in the formation (low vertical permeability). Fractures in such a case will contribute the necessary vertical permeability for a horizontal well to produce. On the other hand, creating transverse fractures is aimed at creating extensive contact with reservoirs that have too low a permeability to produce without stimulation. This type of fracturing has become a common practice in tight sand gas formation or shale oil and gas formations. In fact, multiple transverse fracturing is the only means by which unconventional shale formations can be economically producible.

There are three common ways to complete horizontal wells for multiple fracturing, either longitudinal or transverse: open-hole uncontrolled fracturing, open hole with liners and isolation for controlled multiple-stage fracturing, and cased hole with perforated completion for multiple fracturing. Open-hole uncontrolled fracturing can generate fractures in one or more stages; the other two completion types generate multiple fractures with multiple stages.

An openhole completion for fracturing in an open hole is the simplest and most economical way to fracture a horizontal well. It allows fractures to initiate and propagate at the locations of weak points in the formation rock along the wellbore. Multiple fractures can be created in such a treatment, but the locations of the fractures cannot be predetermined or controlled.

This practice can only be used in competent formations. The critical problem with this method is the lack of control of fracture locations, borehole stability, and sand production.

To better control the location and propagation of multiple fractures, it is common to set liners in open hole with sections isolated in the annulus between the borehole and the liner. The isolation can be achieved either by hydraulically operated inflatable external casing packers (ECPs) or with swelling packers that swell on contact with oil or water.

Multiple sleeves (also commonly called fracture ports) are installed along a liner. Beginning with the sleeve.

During the fracture execution, the isolation balls are dropped into the well one at a time. The balls have two functions: to open a fracture port and to isolate the downstream wellbore behind the port so that a fracture can be initiated at the port. The smallest ball is dropped first to the end of the horizontal wellbore to establish pressure integrity inside the liner.

When fracture stimulation is completed, the balls in the horizontal well should flow back by the well production.

The perforation gun is designed to be able to perforate more than one interval.

Although formation solids are not always sand, in the petroleum industry, the production of any solids from a well is generally called sand production.

Produced solids can accumulate in the well or in subsea or surface flow lines, destroy a downhole pump, or erode various well hardware including slotted liners or screens, gas-lift valves, the surface choke, or any bends in surface pipe.

The cost to remediate consequences of sand production can vary depending on the difficulty to remove accumulated sand or replace worn equipment or eroded hardware.

The critical sanding rate is the production rate at or below which sand production is avoided. The critical sanding rate may drop over time due to changes in the completion or the flow stream. For example, many wells do not produce formation fines until water breakthrough.

Sand management is a term applied to well completion designs that either prevent sand production by monitoring and controlling the well flow rate and/or drawdown, or permit sand production and plan for handling and disposing of produced sand.

Sand exclusion applies to well completions designed to prevent any sand production into the wellbore.

One strategy to achieve sand exclusion is by filtering produced solids before they can be produced into the wellbore with a gravel pack.

Another strategy is to reduce the flow velocity at the formation face by designing the flow geometry with more contact area between the completion and the formation, as with high-angle, horizontal, multilateral, and hydraulically fractured wells.

In general, formation solids may become loose after a shear, volumetric, or tensile failure.

The purpose of sand flow modeling is to predict the conditions under which sand production is expected.

Instead, the sand management approach is to perforate and complete the well without a gravel pack and then produce below the critical drawdown or below the critical sand flow rate indicated by the sand flow model.

If, for example, the production tubing limits the well flow rate to remain below the predicted critical sanding rate, then the well completion design need not require sand exclusion.

Failure due to high effective stress will occur when the difference between the in situ formation stress and the well pressure exceeds the compressive rock strength.

Tensile failure occurs when the rock is under tension and may occur whenever the pressure gradient is high.

In turn, sand arches can be destroyed under sufficiently high fluid flow velocity, or they may be eroded. Once into the wellbore, sand particles will either fall to collect at the bottom of the well, or at high enough fluid flow rate will be produced to the surface.

First, the curves for shear failure occur for large drawdown, even when the flow rate is small.

As flow rate increases, shear failure can occur for smaller drawdown. Comparing the initial perforation to the enlarged cavity (solid curve to dashed curve) reveals that shear failures become less likely after an initial failure enlarges the perforation cavity.

Unloading occurs when the formation is subjected to a sudden drop in pressure, as may occur when the well first starts flowing or during underbalanced perforating. Unloading can also occur after the well has been shut in for a fairly long period.

Often sand production either begins or increases significantly after water breakthrough.

(1) fines fixed by capillary pressure are released with free water saturation,.

(2) pressure gradient near the wellbore increases when oil and water flow together,.

(3) reservoir pressure may have depleted prior to the onset of waterflood pressure maintenance,.

(4) dissolution of cementing materials between sand grains by water, and.

(5) total fluid flow rate may be increased to maintain oil flow rate with increasing watercut.

Stokes’ law can be used to determine the velocity sufficient to lift sand particles to the surface assuming spherical particles and Newtonian liquids in laminar flow. This velocity, known as the slip velocity, us, must be at least 50% more than the terminal settling velocity.

Frequently, sand production occurs briefly each time the well is brought back on production after it has been shut.

In general, sand management without sand exclusion relies on avoiding flow velocity and drawdown sufficient to induce excessive sand production.

Any completion that does not provide for sand exclusion may be subject to sand production. Because sand exclusion completions are more expensive, and because gravel pack completions result in a positive skin from the beginning that grows in magnitude over time, the operator may prefer to avoid the need for sand exclusion, either by producing below the critical sanding rate or critical drawdown, or by deliberately producing sand in a well design that is not destroyed by sand production.

The cavity completion (cavity-like completion) risks some sand production in order to remove near wellbore damage and condition the completion.

Once the sand is produced, no further sand may be produced for a long time if drawdown is reduced somewhat.

Many reservoirs comprised of relatively young sediments are so poorly consolidated that sand will be produced along with the reservoir fluids unless the rate is restricted significantly. Sand production leads to numerous production problems, including erosion of downhole tubulars; erosion of valves, fittings, and surface flow lines; the wellbore filling up with sand; collapsed casing because of the lack of formation support; and clogging of surface processing equipment.

Many reservoirs comprised of relatively young sediments are so poorly consolidated that sand will be produced along with the reservoir fluids unless the rate is restricted significantly. Sand production leads to numerous production problems, including erosion of downhole tubulars; erosion of valves, fittings, and surface flow lines; the wellbore filling up with sand; collapsed casing because of the lack of formation support; and clogging of surface processing equipment. Even if sand production can be tolerated, disposal of the produced sand is a problem, particularly at offshore fields. Thus, a means to eliminate sand production without greatly limiting production rates is desirable.

Originally, sand production was controlled by using gravel pack completions, slotted liner completions, or sand consolidation treatments, with gravel pack completions having been by far the most common approach.

Operators noted that successful prepack gravel placement often posed a need to inject at pressures exceeding the formation fracture pressure. This led to development of the frac-pack approach designed to create a fracture extending past the radius of impaired permeability induced by drilling and completion fluid invasion.

A positive skin of 5–10 is considered excellent in traditional gravel pack completions, and much higher skins have been observed, leading to loss of as much as 50% of the well production capability.

High-rate water pack and frac-pack completions have achieved at best zero and even slightly negative total completion skins as low as –2. Reasons why hydraulic stimulation does not result in more negative skin even for typical fracture half lengths of more than 50 ft are provided in Section 19.4.2.

The gravel pack prevents sand production by trapping the particles, and over time the gravel pack skin will increase.

In contrast, because the flow geometry in the frac-pack provides greater flow area and, hence, less pressure gradient at the formation face, the frac-pack skin is not expected to increase over time, reducing or eliminating a need for completion maintenance.

The two most common types of gravel pack completions are an inside-casing gravel pack and an open-hole or underreamed-casing gravel pack.

A successful gravel pack completion must retain the formation sand and offer the least possible resistance to flow through the gravel itself.

For a successful gravel pack completion, gravel must be adjacent to the formation without having mixed with formation sand, and the annular space between the screen and the casing or formation must be completely filled with gravel. Special equipment and procedures have been developed over the years to accomplish good gravel placement.

Now, viscosified fluids, most commonly solutions of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), are used so that high concentrations of sand can be transported without settling.

In open-hole completions, the gravel-laden fluid can be pumped down the tubing casing annulus, after which the carrier fluid passes through the screen and flows back up the tubing.

Primary disadvantage of this method is the possibility of rust, pipe dope, or other debris being swept out of the annulus and mixed with the gravel, damaging the pack permeability.

A critical element in designing a gravel pack completion is the proper sizing of the gravel and the screen or slotted liner.

To perform its sand control function and maximize the permeability of the gravel pack, the gravel must be small enough to retain the formation sand, yet large enough that clay particles and other formation fines flow through the pack.

Measure accurately the formation particle size distribution.

The productivity of a gravel-packed well is affected by the pressure drop through the gravel pack, if this pressure drop is significant compared with the pressure drop in the formation.

As with any other type of completion, the effect of a gravel pack completion on well performance can be accounted for with a skin factor,.

The pressure drop through the gravel should be very small compared with the formation, unless the gravel permeability has been severely reduced by formation particles. If the productivity is expressed based on the radius.

The pressure drop through the gravel should be very small compared with the formation, unless the gravel permeability has been severely reduced by formation particles. If the productivity is expressed based on the radius of the liner and the gravel pack permeability is greater than the formation permeability, the gravel pack should contribute a small negative skin effect, since it will behave like a larger-diameter wellbore.

In the prepack phase of the gravel pack operation, sand is squeezed though the perforation tunnels as the transport fluid leaks off into the formation.

Furthermore, all gravel pack completions are subject to increasing skin over time as formation fines accumulate at the formation face or in the gravel pack itself. This mechanism is aggravated if most of the perforations become plugged with formation fines because the flow velocity in the formation is related to the well flow rate divided by the total flow area.

Unfocused γ-ray density logs can be used to locate the top of the gravel-packed section and to detect voids in gravel packs by measuring the density of the materials in the region of the well completion.

In unconsolidated formations, pumping above formation parting pressure can result in gravel being packed between the cement and the formation in addition to packing the perforation tunnels.

In the frac-pack literature this is called a halo.

Since, except for very shallow wells or highly overpressured formations, the maximum stress is the overburden stress, most hydraulic fractures propagate in a vertical plane. If the well trajectory is vertical, the hydraulic fracture will be aligned with the well.

Some authors have advocated orienting perforations with 180° phasing in the direction normal to minimum stress to improve fracture to wellbore connectivity.

We have seen already that high-performance fracturing completions should avoid sand production altogether, while gravel pack completions may restrict sand production to only very fine particles.

The spontaneous potential (SP) log deflects to the right in shale intervals; shows similar behavior to the resistivity opposite gas, oil, and water; and fails to distinguish between limestone and dolomite. The compensated neutron log (CNL) and the density log show similar responses in response to changes in fluid saturation and opposite shale intervals.

When added to ln(re/rw) for steady state, ln(0.472 re/rw) for pseudosteady state, or pD for transient solutions, the sum becomes proportional to the total (reservoir plus near-wellbore) pressure drop.

The wormholing process that occurs in carbonates makes it possible to obtain stimulation to sufficient radial penetrations that treating undamaged wells can be of great benefit. In carbonates, acid can also preferentially flow along natural fractures or in vug networks, making the potential depth of acid stimulation even greater. Thus, in carbonate reservoirs, matrix acidizing is often applied without the presence of formation damage.

Moderate permeability reservoirs (up to 50 md for oil and 1 md for gas), the fracture accelerates production without impacting the well reserves. In such reservoirs the rationale for fracturing frequently relies on net present value economics.

It is evident that the pseudosteady-state flow equation for a hydraulically fractured oil well would be.

For continuous gas lift, an “operating valve” is used to inject the appropriate amount of gas at the desirable tubing pressure at the injection point.
