"What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.".

Women want men who are more successful, popular and powerful than they are. This is clear.

Studies show that women are equally attracted to men that they believe have the potential to be extremely successful as they do for men who are already successful.

It explains why the starving artist has no trouble finding girlfriends to support him, and the college athlete can date super models even though he can’t afford a hamburger.

Social status is determined by how you behave around other people, how other people behave around you, and how you treat yourself.

Treat others well, be treated well by others, and treat yourself well.

It had long been thought that female arousal was tied to ideas and the display of security, investment and commitment, particularly from high status men.

The new conclusion is that female arousal is somewhat narcissistic in nature. Women are turned on by being wanted, by being desired.

That the more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes -- sometimes even if she wasn’t interested in you to begin with.

That the more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes -- sometimes even if she wasn’t interested in you to begin with. Your bold and aggressive pursuit of her often turns her on to the point where she comes around and wants to get to know you.

I found that the more I focused on my business and financial success with women I met, the more quickly they would want to get into a relationship with me.

How attractive a man is is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The more needy in his life, the less attractive and vice-versa.

"We are not held back by the love we did not receive in the past; but by the love we do not extend in the present."-.

I’m the first one to propose that the opposite of neediness is actually the root cause of female-to-male attraction.

Neediness plays out by people chronically investing themselves and their identities to receive validation from others around them.

By investment I mean the degree in which you sacrifice/alter your own thoughts/feelings/motivations for someone else. By less I mean that as a man, you should only be willing to sacrifice your thoughts/ feelings/motivations for a woman less than she is willing to do the same for you.

The minute he let’s her dominate him emotionally, he demonstrates a lack of status. He’s no longer dependable. He loses his ability to make her feel secure. And his attractiveness goes out the window.

When a man approaches her and induces her to become more invested than he is, this is the process of seduction.

Evolutionarily speaking, a man’s biggest biological concern is raising children who are his own and a woman’s biggest biological concern is inducing a man to commit to her and her children.

Boy gives girl the impression that he’s less invested in her than he is; or boy demonstrates that he is actually less invested than she is.

Guy meets girl. Guy shows less investment than girl (or induces more investment in girl), sex and/or relationship occurs, guy becomes more invested.

Guy meets girl. Guy shows less investment than girl (or induces more investment in girl), sex and/or relationship occurs, guy becomes more invested than girl, sex stops and/or relationship falls apart.

The fake alpha persona’s motive is exactly the same as the ultra nice guy’s persona: to gain attention and affection from those around them. One guy does it by being nice, one guy does it by being imposing and rude. One tries to induce love. The other tries to induce fear. Both are needy.

A rich man doesn’t need to tell people he’s rich. A confident man doesn’t need to tell people he’s confident. And a guy who "doesn’t give a fuck" doesn’t need to go around telling people he "doesn’t give a fuck.".

In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, "I don’t care what you think of me; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else." He’s saying he’s not needy and that he’s high status.

They focus purely on their task at hand and don’t change their behavior based on what others think of them.

They don’t react to any of the other men around them, rather, the other men react to him.

Chances are, if you’re reading this and are bad with women, then you’re bad with women because you don’t express your true feelings and intentions very well at all.

Have to risk offending or inciting anyone with them. Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy, but because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint others. Perhaps you haven’t exercised.

Perhaps you’re stuck in a job or lifestyle you don’t truly enjoy, but because other people always told you that it was a good idea and you didn’t want to upset or disappoint others.

Dressing extremely well makes you feel uncomfortable, smiling at strangers makes you feel creepy, and the idea of hitting on a woman openly scares you because of the possible rejection.

Was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night.

"selfish." I was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night.

I was the same way. My entire young life I was terrified of anyone not liking me. The mere thought of someone hating me, girl or guy, would literally keep me up at night. As a result, every aspect of my life revolved around people-pleasing, hiding my faults, covering my tracks, blaming others.

"Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges.".

"The less you talk about your shame, the more of it you have.".

And when desire is shown without neediness, it is attractive. When desire is shown with neediness, it is unattractive.

Women want a strong, independent, high status male -- a "doesn’t take shit from anybody" bad boy -- but they want this bad boy to have a depth and a sensitivity that they only open up and show when they’re around her.

How attractive you are is based your non-needy behavior. Your nonneedy behavior is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others. Which brings us to our next chapter: the gift of truth. Chapter 4: The Gift of Truth "The only thing that’s Capital-T True is that you get to decide how you see things."- David Foster Wallace, Writer Most men can relate to the idea of having to try to pick up girls without looking like you’re trying.

When you lavish gifts and praise onto a woman who has not done anything to earn it, you are sub-communicating a desperate need for her attention and validation -- a willingness to sacrifice your self-respect and wealth to win over her affection. It demonstrates a willingness to alter yourself for her to greater degrees than she’s willing to alter herself for you. Remember, this is the definition of neediness and being unattractive.

When in doubt, check your intentions.

The compliments are spoken with the provision that she show him affection in return.

The truth is only the truth when it is given as a gift -- when nothing is expected in return.

If you bought a girl a drink so that she wouldn’t leave to talk to someone else, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you told a girl a story in order to impress her and make her like you, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

If you invited a woman to a restaurant in order to impress her with how much money you had, what does that intention say about you? It says you were needy and behaving in a manner that was not attractive.

That’s why I say it’s about being less invested than women instead of not invested in women.

She can be the most invested person on the planet in what others think of her, and if you’re the second most invested person on the planet, she’ll be attracted to you.

Unconditional honesty can be brutal and scathing at times as well. And strangely enough, brutal and angry honesty can turn a woman on just as much as the most genuine compliment.

When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when she’s out of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate in your life, this subcommunicates the most powerful elements of attraction to her. Far more powerful than an entertaining story or game.

He’s willing to accept and not willing to accept.

Would have told her flat out that if she wasn’t excited to be on a date with me, then I’d rather her save us both the time and not show up.

My boundary is established: I value curiosity, education, intelligence and authenticity.

"Any individual who wants to be a leader has to be controversial. Otherwise they don’t stand for anything."-.

Rejection exists for a reason -- it’s a means to keep people who are not good for each other apart.

Guys don’t seem to understand if a woman rejects him because he’s short, or because she doesn’t like his hair, or because she finds him boring, then he wasn’t going to want to be around her anyway.

Because a man who does not act on his sexual urges is a man who is needy and therefore unattractive.

Typically, if guys have been friends with a girl for even a month or two without ever explicitly indicating their sexual interest in her, it’s usually too late.

This is the plight of the Nice Guy. He’s afraid of inciting an emotional response in anybody, much less women (and especially himself), therefore he’ll play it safe and elicit Neutral reactions from woman after woman.

Having good game means you can take a woman who is neutral in her attraction towards you and incite her to become attracted.

But I’ve found that women who are Receptive to you to begin with, will usually stay Receptive almost indefinitely. I think these are the only rare occasions when you can actually pry yourself out of the Friend Zone -- these rare circumstances where she was always Receptive you, but for whatever reason, you two weren’t able to be together (you had a girlfriend, she moved away for three years, etc.).

The percentage of women who are Receptive to you will increase proportionally to the quality of your lifestyle, your social status and your looks.

You have to either make the decision to accept being controversial and confrontational or you need to accept that you will go through life with everyone being Neutral towards you.

You’d be surprised how many women will respond with attraction to nothing other than a man who is bold and willing to make a move.

Remember women are turned on by men who desire them.

And polarizing women is more important than being pleasant to them.

Being slapped also taught me that you can’t always control how people react to you. Some people are completely out of their minds, or they behave very inappropriately.

Was the consummate Nice Guy, always trying to keep things smooth and pleasant.

Was aware of my values and stood by them.

If you presented yourself well, polarized and was frank about your intentions.

Each woman is a concoction of flavors, whipped together into her own unique personality and style. What we do as men is taste-test them. Many of them will be gross. Some of them will be interesting but not very good. Some of them we will love but will be bad for us. Others we’ll love and never want to stop drinking. The goal is to find that magical combination that we never want to stop drinking.

Most men when they approach women, they approach thinking something like, "I hope she likes me," or "I hope she doesn’t embarrass me or reject me." It’s all about them. And therefore, when things don’t go anywhere, the men take it personally — they get upset, or angry or butt-hurt that this random stranger with tits isn’t interested right now.

Often these guys are decent-looking, successful and smart and seem to have their lives together. But literally not a single woman they meet is interested in them. How can this be?.

My contention is that these men are severely disassociated from their true identity. They’ve got massive amounts of emotional baggage that they’re oblivious to, yet it permeates all of their interactions.

They’re typically extremely needy and desperate, seeking approval without knowing why and with a complete disregard to how they go about it.

These men seek to deceive women about their intentions because these men actively deceive themselves about their intentions.

Deceiving a woman who is not interested in you to hopefully become interested in you is only setting yourself up for a more punishment and disastrous failures down the road. Which then leads to further rejection.

Too many men become satisfied with how many women they can approach or how many phone numbers they can collect.

The three ways are 1) living based on our values; 2) becoming comfortable with our intentions; and 3) by expressing our sexuality freely.

The first way of expressing our truth involves developing a lifestyle that makes us happy. The second way of expressing truth is by being courageous and fighting through our fears and anxieties. And the third way of expressing truth is by communicating well and being uninhibited in our sexuality.

Creating an attractive and appealing lifestyle; Overcoming your fears and anxiety around women, and mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.

Honest Living, Honest Action, and Honest Communication.

If you’re in a job you hate with hobbies you hate and friends you don’t like, then no matter what you do or how much money you make, you’re going to have a hard time meeting attractive women that you enjoy and who enjoy being with you.

If your true passion is art and you push paper around at an insurance firm, then you’re not living honestly with yourself.

If you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of dishonesty to yourself. If you’re standing in a bar, and you see a cute girl, and you keep looking at her all night afraid to do something, on a deep level, you’re being dishonest to your intentions and sexuality. You’re being needy and unable to expose your vulnerability.

You’re afraid to approach a woman,.

If you’re afraid to approach a woman, it’s because somewhere in you you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are of yourself.

A good sense of humor, the ability to connect with people, telling stories, engaging people’s attention, having charisma, and expressing your sexuality openly, these are all parts of this fundamental.

A man with an amazing lifestyle, but poor action and poor communication will be surrounded by beautiful and interesting women but never hook up with them.

Anxious guys tend to have the third fundamental down very well. They’re good at expressing themselves and are very aware of social norms and what others are thinking/feeling. In fact, in a lot of cases Anxious guys are TOO aware of what other people are thinking and feeling and therefore have a lot of social anxiety. They’re afraid to approach. They get nervous pushing things forward, they’re scared to ask girls on dates. Generally though,.

If you hate what she loves and she hates what you love, it’s not going to go anywhere. Period.

What do you value you in a woman? Honesty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education? Women with the.

What do you value you in a woman? Honesty? Affection? Intelligence? Curiosity? Similar interests? Education?.

What do you enjoy doing most? Do you love to read/write? Do you play music? Do you enjoy sports and competitions? What are events or organizations that you can become involved in that explore your hobbies?.

If you don’t know what your passions and interests are, take a minute and write down things that you’ve always wanted to do but have never had the time or never worked up the nerve to do. Make a promise to yourself to get.

And our metric for success is maximizing happiness, not racking up the most lays, or the having the most impressive game (whatever that means).

We want to be with women who make us happy.

If you’re interested in spirituality and meditation, pursue it. If you’re interested in politics and being active in your community, pursue it. If you’re interested in food from around the world, pursue it. Take up cooking classes, food tastings, restaurant openings, etc.

There are some men who operate on the assumption that all women are interested in them until proven otherwise.

Let's begin with women who are attracted to you and are NOT playing games -- they're being upfront and honest about their interest. But because you believe they ARE playing games, you're going to try to "out-game" a woman who's not actually playing games with you. This will actually come off as try-hard and highmaintenance, effectively scaring off the honest and upfront women from becoming involved with you.

The other finding is that the less well off SHE is, the more important money will be to her.

Money usually don’t care about it nearly as much. But the fact remains that women perceive men with money the same way we perceive women with good-looks: as social.

The stereotype of Latin men is that they’re romantic and emotional, but also selfish and unfaithful.

Asian or Indian men is that they are hard-working and smart, but traditional, very analytical, and emotionally shut down.

The stereotype of Middle Eastern men is that they are controlling and somewhat misogynistic.

The stereotype of black men is that they are very aggressive and sometimes disrespectful.

Don’t just pursue your interests, become a leader in your interests.

The second major difference is more difficult to handle -- the fact that more beautiful women are less needy than average makes them more difficult than the average woman. But paradoxically, if you try harder to get with a more beautiful woman, then you will demonstrate yourself as even more needy than before. It’s back to the ole “try to look like you’re not trying” conundrum.

Not necessarily. It’s OK to recognize a woman’s beauty and to be turned on by that beauty. But it’s not OK to invest one’s identity in attaining or conquering that beauty. Because that leads to neediness.

Beautiful woman will not necessarily make you happier than a less beautiful woman.

People really don’t get it, these girls don’t have it that great. Imagine wanting to date a really great guy, someone who actually cares about you, and literally every single guy you meet starts acting like a total idiot trying to impress you or manipulate you into bed. Meanwhile, your friends who aren’t as pretty as you seem to keep meeting really nice normal guys who actually care about them. It’s actually very frustrating. Imagine having EVERYONE evaluate you for how pretty you are and not your personality or what you say. You’d actually be pretty insecure about what people thought of you. This is also why the best way to net a Top 1% girl is to connect with her genuinely and emotionally as soon as possible. Find something that you like about her other than her looks and relate that to her honestly.

“Tell the beautiful girls they’re smart and tell the smart girls that they’re beautiful.”.

And in the meantime, get your life together. Stop caring about looks so much. Treat her like you’d treat anybody else. Stop approaching her to prove something to yourself. Stop treating her like a trophy or an achievement or a merit badge… and just talk to her. Just the fact that you talk to her like a normal human being with confidence and civility will immediately differentiate you from 99% of the other guys she meets.

It’s that it is far more powerful to be something attractive rather than to say something attractive.

Whereas if you ARE something amazing, then no matter what you say will be attractive, because it will be coming from a genuinely attractive man.

“You know, I get a good feeling from you, you’re someone worth knowing.”.

Your life and everything that it encompasses, is a reflection of your emotional investment in yourself. And the more invested you are in yourself, the less needy you are with others.

They’ll groom themselves to the bareminimum level. They’ll get the normal job or go to a normal school just because that’s what normal people do. They never bothered to strive to do something unique or original or transcendent because that would mean risking not being accepted by others.

And as a result, these men present themselves poorly. They’re highly-invested, needy individuals and this is immediately apparent in their appearance and lifestyle.

They dress normally (or poorly), look normal, say normal things, go to a normal job, and live in a normal place.

Being sexual and being attractive, by its very nature, is controversial. You must be willing to do something that is going to make you stand out. You are going to have to be willing to risk people not liking you. You have to be willing to sacrifice some people’s approval in order to live life on your own terms.

You have to be willing to polarize people’s opinion of you. The less polarizing you are, the less attractive you are. And if you live an un-polarizing life, then you not going to be attractive or unattractive.

You’re just going to be boring. More of the same. Dime a dozen. Hopefully.

Not everybody is born good-looking. But any man, with some time and effort, can become handsome. And in the end, what women want is a man who is handsome.

And your level of self-investment will make you less needy towards others -- therefore making you more attractive.

That means regular showering, shaving and haircuts, wearing deodorant, brushing and flossing your teeth, keeping clean fingernails and wearing clean clothes.

Here’s an easy way to get started. Go out and buy a “black set” and a “brown set”. Buy a nice pair of black shoes, a nice black belt, and a black jacket. Then buy a nice pair of brown shoes, a brown belt, and a brown jacket. Then buy a few pairs of nice designer jeans with lighter and darker washes and a dozen or so shirts. Then it’s just mix-and-match. You pick a pair of jeans, a nice shirt, and then throw your “brown set” or your “black set” on – whichever set compliments the shirt and jeans the best. I like to wear the brown set with lighter shirts and jeans, and the black set with darker shirts and jeans.

The colors that look best on me are bright blue, green, purple and maroon.

White, Grey, Pink, Light Blue, Khakis, Yellow. What doesn’t work: Purple, Dark Brown,.

You’ll quickly start to notice that: Most guys don’t dress well at all. The majority of the guys in the venue are dressed exactly the same way.

I shouldn’t have to tell you that women love to shop. And they particularly love to shop for guys.

Don’t ever look down at the ground unless you think you’re about to trip. Look people in the eye as they walk by – particularly attractive girls. You’ll catch people making eye contact with you. You’ll feel the urge to look away. Don’t. Always make other people break eye contact with you before you break it with them. Do it until it becomes habit.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Vladmir Nabokov, John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, etc. You may be rolling your eyes and thinking, “this is like college all over again.”.

Assume everything has a form of value; it’s your job to find it. Nothing drives me crazier than to meet people who are prejudice against a genre of music or type of movie for no other reason than they don’t particularly like the culture attached to it.

“Citizen Kane”,.

Wedding Crashers isn’t trying to make a greater philosophical statement, it’s trying to make you laugh and feel a little good. And it accomplishes that extremely well. So it should be considered a good movie. Sure, comedies aren’t as hard to make as a deep, probing movie like “Citizen Kane”, but that doesn’t make them “bad.”.

“You read literature because you can NEVER meet enough people.”.

Do you secretly write poetry in your spare time and hide it in your closet? Have you been skydiving three times? Did you climb a glacier in the Alps once? Have you tried eating things like snake, worms, spiders? What have you done that’s cool and interesting and has shaped you as a person? The possibilities are endless. So let’s.

Do you secretly write poetry in your spare time and hide it in your closet? Have you been skydiving three times? Did you climb a glacier in the Alps once? Have you tried eating things like snake, worms, spiders? What have you done that’s cool and interesting and has shaped you as a person? The possibilities are endless. So let’s do an exercise. Take out a sheet of paper.

“I know this sounds stupid and obvious, but I just realized something. Simply having an opinion on everything makes you cooler than half the guys out there.”.

And how can you emotionally connect with another person if you can’t emotionally connect with yourself?.

Get your life taken care of. Get healthy. Find a happy group of friends. Find a few hobbies that you love. Develop opinions. Start caring about what you spend your time doing. This increases your self-investment and will make you less needy around others. This in turn will give you the courage to take the correct action and the wherewithal to communicate effectively. This is honest living.

Woulda-coulda-shoulda moments.

Over the years anxiety morphs into apathy which morphs into arrogance.

The apathy and avoidance pattern is the root behind the couch potatoes and disgruntled office workers of the world.

Tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

Use intellectualizing as just another form of avoidance. It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem, because the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and convince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.

The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s HER fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself.

The blame game guy will convince himself that it’s HER fault. The apathy guy will convince himself that it doesn’t matter. The intellectualizing guy will convince himself that he needs to learn and understand more first.

Humans stereotype for a reason: so that we can manage large chunks of information in order to orient ourselves more efficiently.

Often there’s a little bit of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t exist.

You may have had no control over the fact that your parents divorced when you were young and your father was emotionally distant. You can react as a victim (people are nasty and selfish) or you can learn from it, take control and move on.

“God, grant me the serenity to accept things that I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”.

Although there’s no scientific evidence (yet) for porn addiction, here’s something I can tell you that is absolutely true: porn kills your motivation to pursue women in real life.

Napoleon Hill wrote a famous section in his classic work Think and Grow Rich called “Sexual Transfiguration.” Hill noticed and theorized, that extremely successful men also had extremely high sex drives. But not only did they have very high sex drives, but they channeled this sexual energy into their work and their accomplishments. Often they would abstain from sex or masturbation for long periods of time and would therefore feel more energized.

Orgasms, or more accurately, ejaculation in men, actually causes a depletion of various hormones and endorphins which often lead to useful behaviors as well as motivation.

For instance, people with anger issues are encouraged to channel their anger through productive means -- exercising, working, writing letters displaying their feelings, etc. To avoid or ignore the anger will only bring it back next time.

In the old Pick Up Artist days, there was something called “The 3-Second Rule” which dictated that once you saw a woman you liked you had three seconds to approach her no matter what. The rule was designed to avoid this scenario.

“What you resist will persist.”.

The way to attack anxieties is through incremental, but high volume exposure. Not single, extreme exposure.

Repetition, or low intensity and high repetition. The high intensity, low repetition increases the power of your muscles.

The high intensity, low repetition increases the power of your muscles.

Whereas the low intensity, high repetition increases your conditioning.

But there’s a caveat here. You must know that you’re interrupting social norms. You must acknowledge that what you are doing is unusual. Else, if you don’t, you’ll simply be seen as someone who is out of touch and oblivious, which is not attractive.

“Always err on the side of aggression.”.

“You know, if you weren’t so cute, I’d ditch you for saying that.”.

When a man shows he’s willing to break rapport with a girl, he’s demonstrating vulnerability,.

When a man shows he’s willing to break rapport with a girl, he’s demonstrating vulnerability, and therefore a lack of neediness and investment.

This sub-communicates a willingness to lose her, which then sub-communicates nonneediness and less investment.

Another classic situation is flinging harsh teases immediately followed by sincere compliments. For instance, you could make fun of how indecisive she is ordering her drinks and tell her that indecisiveness isn’t going to lead her anywhere in life. When she responds with some indignation, you could then compliment her on how beautiful her eyes are when she’s mad. This absolutely bamboozles women in a very, very good way.

Do it in a positive way that she’ll be receptive to. Failure to act on your sexual desires will lead you straight to the friend zone with almost all women, and back to the rampant frustration that brought you here in the first place.

Typical ways guys startle or scare women upon the approach is by approaching them from behind.

We would all rather here 30 seconds of AMAZING communication than 10 minutes of mediocre communication saying the same thing.

Creating threads of conversation through statement is far more powerful than questions. This is because it assumes rapport.

Questions are a polite way of requesting information of someone. They create the frame that you desire something from her and she is obligated to fulfill your request. But statements make it so that you’re constantly giving away information and value to the other person.

Only broad questions feel socially acceptable. Specific and eccentric questioning comes off as odd and unattractive.

Would consider “cute.” Questioning should be limited to a minimum. Often, asking her a question is unavoidable to get.

Questioning should be limited to a minimum.

Cold-reading is a skill where you’re able to intuitively “know” something about someone else without actually knowing it.

You don’t ask the question you want to know, but instead you make a mild prediction.

“How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys.

“How do you guys know each other?” translates to: “You guys look like you’ve been friends for a long time.”.

The only thing people love more than talking about themselves is hearing about themselves.

These will sometimes come across as random. But that’s because they are – they’re whatever thoughts are popping into your head at the moment. It’s better to be random and interesting than predictable and boring. Don’t be afraid to just blurt something out.

When you are talking to a woman, there are only two REAL subjects of conversation: her and you. Everything you speak about should be, in some way, revealing your identity to her or her identity to you. This uncovering of identity is what creates the sense of a “connection”. The greater the connection you create, the more she’ll want to spend more time with you and vice-versa.

Being open about yourself; getting her to be open about herself; relating to her experience.

Your passions and favorite things to do. Your dreams, ambitions, life goals. The best/worst things that have happened to you. Your childhood, family life, and upbringing.

At it’s core, humor is the art of drawing connections between two seemingly unrelated ideas or objects.

Misdirection, exaggeration, sarcasm, wordplay and roleplaying.

“There’s a new book out called ‘Why Women Have Sex’ that says there are 237 reasons why women have sex. And folks, David Letterman knows the top 10.”.

“You know that look women get when they want to have sex? ... Yeah, me neither.”.

Relating it to David Letterman’s famous “Top 10” segments on his show and the fact that Letterman sleeps with his interns. It’s the connection of these two seemingly unrelated topics that makes it funny.

“She’s a nice woman though, nicest three acres of flesh I’ve ever met.”.

“She was as ugly as a dog.”.

“She was as ugly as a dog.” “I’ve seen more attractive things in the bottom of an airport urinal.”.

Seriously, sarcasm isn’t for everybody. Sarcasm is when you make an extreme statement that’s completely opposite of what you actually mean.

Seriously, sarcasm isn’t for everybody. Sarcasm is when you make an extreme statement that’s completely opposite of what you actually mean. You often say it with complete seriousness and without smiling.

When a woman loves sarcasm, she LOVES sarcasm.

“Not all of us hate ourselves like you do.”.

“That’s it, we’re getting divorced.” It’s funny because I just met her, but you can actually milk a lot of fun out of something simple like this -- i.e., “You keep the kids, I’m moving the Europe.” “By the way, your music sucks, and I never liked your casseroles either.”.

Some of my favorites are Louis CK, George Carlin, Bill Maher, Bill Hicks, and Chris Rock. Pay attention to their delivery, their timing, their facial expressions.

Instead of making fun of yourself, make fun of the girl you’re talking to.

Also, beware of falling into the trap of self-deprecating humor.

How it will blow your interactions wide open and infuse more sexuality and playfulness into them.

Like it or not, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid process. You meet girl, ask girl on date, correspond with girl, set up date with girl, correspond with girl, set up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home with you, and at some point you decide if you’re exclusive, non-exclusive, a casual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever again.

“Never text her twice in a row,”.

It’s that connection that’s going to get her out to see you again, not the clever text you spent 45 minutes coming up with.

I’ve found that the cuter or harder you try to win girls over by text, the bigger chance you have of looking needy and desperate and losing them.

Texting is, in general, an awful medium for communication.

“Hey, what are you doing Thursday night?”.

So clear, blunt language. I tell guys that I only use texting to organize when she and I are going to see each other next.

Always revert back to that level. If anything, being cute and trying to impress will only hurt you, as it will come across as needy and unattractive.

They get really excited about sending fancy or brilliant texts that magically change a girl’s mind on a dime. Don’t bother. Short of lying or manipulation, it almost never works.

Remove, “What do you want to do now?” from your dating vocabulary. Never say it again.

“Hey, let’s grab some tacos, I know a cool stand over here,” “I got an idea, I’m going to kick your ass in air hockey,” “Let’s check out the Science museum, they have an awesome exhibit on the human body,” etc.

But after dating a lot of these women, I realized that there’s an intrinsic sense of chivalry that they enjoy and makes them feel feminine and sexy. After all, the primary attractor in women is status and security. Taking care of them and paying for them can often lend itself to that. So why not?.

You are a sexually aggressive and dominant guy and you have no shame … We’ll also discover that women actually prefer you to be this way.

“That’s too cute, I can’t handle it,”.

“They make it look so easy in the movies.”.

Try masturbating a few hours before you expect to have sex.

The phrase is: “What if it is a gift?” Whatever happens to you, no matter how bad, no matter how bleak you feel. Ask yourself, “What if it was a gift?” And then try to rationalize a way it could be so.

Women are generally only attracted to men who are less invested in them, than they are in themselves.
