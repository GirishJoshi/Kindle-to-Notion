(On second thought, are you SURE you want this published, Blake? It might beef up the competition!).

There are lots of good screenwriting how-to's out there. And if you want to see where it all began, look to the master, Syd Field, who started it all and taught everybody.

I like Viki King's book with the improbable title of How to Write a Movie in 21 Days. Improbable, yes, but I've done it — and sold the script I wrote, too.

I also value Joseph Campbell's work. Hero With A Thousand Faces remains the best book about storytelling ever.

Because liking the person we go on a journey with is the single most important element in drawing us into the story.

The problem for us, the spec screenwriters of the world, is that we don't own any of these pre-sold franchises nor are we likely to. We're the guys and gals with a laptop computer and a dream.

(Please note: Anything "from hell" is always a comedy plus.).

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is: irony.

One of my personal favorites is producer David Permut's pitch for Blind Date: "She's the perfect woman — until she has a drink." I don't know about you, but I see it. I see a beautiful girl and a date gone bad and a guy who wants to save it because... she's the one! There's a lot going on in that one-line, far more than in the actual movie, but that's a different subject altogether. The point is that a good logline, in addition to pulling you in, has to offer the promise of more.

If you don't have the logline, maybe you should rethink your whole movie.

No matter who is encouraging you on the friend side of your life, it's the strangers you really need to impress.

Movies are intricately made emotion machines.

A hero goes "on the road" in search of one thing and winds up discovering something else — himself.

Psyche. "I wish I had a_" is probably the single most frequently spoken prayer since Adam.

"An ordinary guy finds himself in extraordinary circumstances.".

When A Man Loves A Woman.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.

Each has a breakout character whose role is to expose the group goal as a fraud.

When we put on a uniform, be it the uniform of the Army or a comfortable cotton shirt with a little polo player over the pocket, we give up who we are to a certain extent.

Indeed our identification with him must come from sympathy for the plight of being misunderstood.

True originality can't begin until you know what you're breaking away from.

Survival, hunger, sex, protection of loved ones, and fear of death grab us.

A guy gets a talking car. Knowing what you know about how to amp up the hero, the bad guy, and the primal goal, write a logline for that idea. And make sure you use adjectives that grab us.

"You have to be this tall to go on this ride.".

Had delivered on the promise of the premise.

One night I taped the old comedy classic What's Up, Doc?, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. And I discovered, the next day as I topped the mountain crest, that the movie was perfectly, evenly divided into two halves and that its midpoint was a "down.".

Experienced as I topped the mountain pass and the first half of What's Up, Doc? that I had taped came to an end. The movie had two even halves! The power and the purpose of a strong midpoint was forever clear to me. After that I began to see how many movies had midpoints that changed the whole dynamic of the film. But the midpoint does more than present an "up" or "down." You will hear the phrase "the stakes are raised at the midpoint" in a lot of script meetings. Because they are. It's the point where the fun and games are over. It's back to the story! It's also the point where if you have a "false victory" where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-the-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

But it's a false victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson he really needs. It just seems like everything's great.

The rule is: It's never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All Is Lost point.

Screenplays are structure. Precisely made Swiss clocks of emotion.

Here's a great rule of thumb: A hero never asks questions! The hero knows and others around him look to him for answers, not the other way around. If you see a lot of question marks in your hero's dialogue, there's a problem. The hero knows; he never asks.

Good dialogue tells us more about what's going on in its subtext than on its surface.

It's been done, babe, it's been done.
