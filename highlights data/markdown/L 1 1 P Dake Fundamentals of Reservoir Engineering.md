Interpretative technique of Havlena and Odeh, to gain an understanding of reservoir drive mechanisms under primary recovery conditions.

The equation is derived as a volume balance which equates the cumulative observed production, expressed as an underground withdrawal, to the expansion of the fluids in the reservoir resulting from a finite pressure drop.

Since the initial oil is in equilibrium with a gascap, the oil must be at saturation or bubble point pressure. Reducing the pressure below pi will result in the liberation of solution gas. The total amount of solution gas in the oil is NRsi scf. The amount still dissolved in the N stb of oil at the reduced pressure is NRs scf.Therefore, the gas volume liberated during the pressure drop ∆p, expressed in reservoir barrels at the lower pressure, is N(R − si R s ) B g (rb) (3.2) b) Expansion of the gascap gas The total volume of gascap gas is mNBoi rb, which in scf may be expressed as G mNB = oi B (scf ) gi This amount of gas, at the reduced pressure p, will occupy a reservoir volume mNB B g oi B (rb) gi Therefore, the expansion of the gascap is  B g  mNB − oi 1  B (rb) gi  (3.3) c) Change in the HCPV due to the connate water expansion and pore volume reduction.

Since the initial oil is in equilibrium with a gascap, the oil must be at saturation or bubble point pressure.

All that is known about the total gas production is that, at the lower pressure, Np Rs scf will be dissolved in the Np stb of oil. The remaining produced gas, Np (Rp − Rs) scf is therefore, the total amount of liberated and gascap gas produced during the pressure drop ∆p and will occupy a volume N(Rp − Rs)Bg rb at the lower pressure. The total underground withdrawal term is therefore.

In which the final term (We − Wp)Bw is the net water influx into the reservoir. This has been intuitively added to the right hand side of the balance since any such influx must expel an equivalent amount of production from the reservoir thus increasing the left hand side of the equation by the same amount. In this influx term We = Cumulative water influx from the aquifer into the reservoir, stb. Wp = Cumulative amount of aquifer water produced, stb. and Bw = Water formation volume factor rb/stb. Bw is generally.

Bw is generally close to unity since the solubility of gas in water is rather small and this condition will be assumed throughout this text.

The equation is always evaluated, in the way it was derived, by comparing the current volumes at pressure p to the original volumes at pi . It is not evaluated in a step-wise or differential fashion. Although the equation appears a little intimidating, at first sight, it should be thought of as nothing more than a sophisticated version of the compressibility definition dV = c × V × ∆p Production = Expansion of reservoir fluids.and, under certain circumstances, can in fact be reduced to this simple form. In using the material balance equation, one of the main difficulties lies in the determination of the representative average reservoir pressure at which the pressure dependent parameters in the equation should be evaluated. This follows from the zero dimensional nature of the equation which implies that there should be some point in the reservoir at which a volume averaged pressure can be uniquely determined. In applying the more simple gas material balance, equ.(1.35), such a point could be defined with reasonable accuracy as the centroid point, at which pressures could be evaluated throughout the producing life of the.

Since the saturations are conventionally expressed as fractions of the pore volume, dividing by 1 − Swc expresses them as fractions of the hydrocarbon pore volume.

Once the free gas saturation in the reservoir exceeds the critical saturation for flow, then as noted already in Chapter 2, sec.2, the gas will start to be produced in disproportionate quantities compared to the oil and, in the majority of cases, there is little that can be done to avert this situation during the primary production phase. Under very favourable conditions the oil and gas will separate with the latter moving structurally updip in the reservoir. This process of gravity segregation relies upon a high degree of structural relief and a favourable permeability to flow in the updip direction. Under more normal circumstances, the gas is prevented from moving towards the top of the structure by inhomogeneities in the reservoir and capillary trapping forces.

Reducing a well's offtake rate or closing it in temporarily to allow gas-oil separation to occur may, under these circumstances, do little to reduce the producing gas oil ratio.

The most remarkable being the Brent field in the North Sea 6 in which at the gas oil contact the oil has a saturation pressure of 5750 psi and a solution gas oil ratio of 2000 scf/stb, while at the oil water contact, some 500 feet deeper, the saturation pressure and solution gas oil ratio are 4000 psi and 1200 scf/stb, respectively. Such extremes are rarely encountered and in the case of the Brent field the anomaly is attributed to gravity segregation of the lighter hydrocarbon components.

The value of N, however, is fairly well defined from information obtained from the producing wells. Under these circumstances the best way to interpret equ.(3.24) is to plot F as a function of (Eo + mEg) for an assumed value of m. If the correct value has been chosen then the resulting plot should be a straight line passing through the origin with slope N, as shown in fig.3.7. If the value of m selected is too small or too large, the plot will deviate above or below the line, respectively.

One advantage of this particular interpretation is that the straight line must pass through the origin which therefore acts as a control point.

Only if there is no water influx.

For large aquifers a mathematical model is required which includes time dependence, to cater for the fact that it takes a finite time for the aquifer to respond fully to a pressure change in the reservoir.

This equation is non-linear since the coefficients on both sides are themselves functions of the dependent variable, the pressure.

Description of well testing and well inflow, which have considerable practical application in reservoir engineering. This is considered of greater importance than deriving the basic equation in cartesian coordinates since analytical solutions of the latter are seldom used in practice by field engineers. In numerical reservoir simulation, however, cartesian geometry is more commonly used but even in this case the flow into or out of a well is controlled by equations expressed in radial form such as those presented in the next four chapters. The radial cell geometry is shown in fig. 5.1 and initially the following.
