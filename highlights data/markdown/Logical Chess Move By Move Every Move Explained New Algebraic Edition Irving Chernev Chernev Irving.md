Develop knights before bishops!.

One reason for the cogency of this principle is that the knight takes shorter steps than the bishop. It takes longer for him to get to the fighting area. The bishop can sweep the length of the chessboard in one move (notice how the f1-bishop can reach all the way to a6). Where the knight takes a hop, skip and jump to get to b5, the bishop makes it in one leap.

“The best attacking piece is the king’s bishop,” says Tarrasch, so White puts this piece to work and clears the way for early castling.

“You should never, unless of necessity or to gain an advantage, move the pawns in front of the castled king,” says Tarrasch, “for each pawn move loosens the position.”.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.” This.

“The game cannot better be opened than by advancing the e-pawn two squares.”.

The act of leaving the back rank constitutes a developing move.

“Castle because you want to or because you must, but not because you can.”.

“In the beginning of the game ignore the search for combinations, abstain from violent moves. Aim for small advantages, accumulate them, and only after having attained these ends search for the combination – and then with all the power of will and intellect, because then the combination must exist, however deeply hidden.”.

The knight possesses the peculiar property of being able to attack any other piece (except another knight) without being under attack in return.

In queen’s pawn openings, Black’s queen’s knight often does a better job at d7 than at c6.

But why give the king’s permanent address when White has revealed that he is preparing an assault on the kingside?.

“As Rousseau could not compose without his cat beside him, so I without my king’s bishop cannot play chess,”.

“In its absence the game to me is lifeless and cold. The vitalizing factor is missing, and I can devise no plan of attack.”.

The Ruy Lopez is probably the strongest of all kingside openings.

The pawn attacks the bishop that attacks the knight that defends the pawn that the knight attacks.

This is the point! The knight gives up his good position for a worthy cause. It is important, in order to capitalize on the weakness of the dark square f6, to remove the guardian of this square, the dark-squared bishop on e7.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead.

Don’t believe all those stories you hear of chess masters analysing intricate combinations with dozens of variations for thirty moves ahead. They don’t do this because they don’t have to! It is far easier and more to the point to look only a few moves ahead and try to maintain at least an equal game at every stage. Winning by accumulating small advantages is more consistent with a common-sense approach than to seek to overwhelm the opponent with bewildering combinations and venturesome sacrificial attacks. Strengthening one’s own position gradually while undermining that of the opponent is more important than indulging in fruitless speculative fancies.

Begin with 1 e4 or 1 d4, either of which moves releases two pieces.

Anchor at least one pawn in the centre and give it solid support. Pawns in the centre keep enemy pieces from settling themselves on the best squares.

There is danger, though, in attempting this before the king has castled.

Strategically, this represents a triumph for White. Not only does he remain with the advantage of the two bishops against Black’s knight and bishop, but he has also compelled Black’s remaining bishop to take up an unfavourable post, while White retains control of the long light-squared diagonal.

The point of playing 2 c4 so soon is that it disputes the centre at once, without endangering the safety of the king.

It took many years, and a great many losses by Black, to discover that an early fianchetto of the bishop was not an easy solution to the problem of the bishop’s development.

All moves must be made with respect to the threats of the opponent, not to arbitrary judgements which declare that certain moves are always ‘good’ or ‘bad’.

The c-pawn must be free to advance and attack White’s centre.

Why not win a pawn by 5 cxd5 exd5 6 xd5 instead? There would then follow 6... xd5! (the knight breaks the pin by brute force) 7 xd8 b4+ 8 d2 xd2+ 9 xd2 xd8 and Black has gained a piece.

Notice that White’s pawn at a3 prevents Black from regaining the pawn by 10... b4+, showing that White’s sixth move was not a waste of time.

Notice that he plays no combinations of any sort, either to win material or to start an attack on the king, until most of his pieces are brought off the back rank and into play. It.

“He who fears possession of an isolated d-pawn should give up chess.”.

It is important to keep the pawn position in the centre fluid. It is important to maintain pressure on White’s d-pawn in the centre. It is important to retain the option of exchanging pawns in the centre.

Rooks must seize open files! What if there are none? Then bring your rooks toward the centre! They will then be at the head of files most likely to be opened. That is why the king’s rook is usually developed at e8 or d8, while the queen’s rook goes to d8 or c8.

“offers the maximum of security with the maximum of opportunity.”.

Whether objectively this is the strongest move is immaterial; the fact that the bishop’s pressure bothers Black is enough reason for Janowsky to maintain the pin!.

In endings where one side has a material advantage, the prescribed strategy is to exchange pieces, not pawns, and to bring it down to a pawn ending. Endings.

“The hardest thing is to win a won game”.

Supporting a piece under attack (here the bishop at d5) puts more pressure on Black, where a direct exchange or a retreat might relieve it.
