Measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei (protons) contained within the fluid-filled pore space of porous media (reservoir rocks).

Because these protons primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example:.

NMR logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present, the properties of these fluids, and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids.

T1 describes how quickly the protons align within the static magnetic field.

T1 describes how quickly the protons align within the static magnetic field. The T1 curve is an exponential curve that characterizes the rate of change of the proton magnetization.

T1 is the time at which the magnetization reaches 63% of its final value, and three times T1 is the time at which 95% polarization is achieved.

Large values of T1 (measured in milliseconds) correspond to weak coupling between the fluid and its surrounding environment and a slow approach to magnetic equilibrium, whereas, small T1 values represent strong coupling and a rapid approach to equilibrium. Different fluids, such as water, oil, and gas, have very different T1 values. T1 is directly related to pore size and viscosity.

Pulse NMR devices use precisely timed bursts (pulse sequences) of RF energy that generate an oscillating magnetic field (B1) that tilts or "tips" the aligned protons perpendicular (x-y plane) to the direction of the applied magnetic field. The application of B1 results in a change in energy state that causes the protons to precess in phase to one another. These changes are known as NMR.

When the B1 field is turned off, the precessions of the protons are no longer in phase with one another, and the net magnetization decreases. In this situation, a receiver coil (antenna) that measures magnetization in the transverse direction will detect an exponential decaying signal called free-induction decay (FID);.

The process of spins lossing their coherence due to magnetic field inhomogeneity is not a true "relaxation" process and is dependent on the location of the molecule in the magnet field distirbution. Therefore, the FID decay constant is often referred as T2* rather than T2.

The primary objectives in NMR logging are measuring T1 signal amplitude (as a function of polarization), T2 signal amplitude and decay, and their distributions.

The total signal amplitude is proportional to the total hydrogen content and is calibrated to give formation porosity independent of lithology effects.

In NMR logging, T1 measurement initially required either a stationary mode or very slow logging speeds.

T2 measurement uses the spin-echo technique, in which the protons are first tipped into the transverse (x-y) plane by a 90° RF pulse and then inverted (flipped) by a subsequent 180° RF pulse at a fixed-time interval to rephase the dephasing protons.
