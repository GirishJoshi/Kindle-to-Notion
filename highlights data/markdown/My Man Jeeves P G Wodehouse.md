Felt I should never be happy till I had one like it.

The long and the short of it was that the confounded.

“After this,” I said, “not another step for me without your advice. From now on consider yourself the brains of the establishment.”.

A portrait-painter, he called himself, but he hadn't painted any portraits. He was sitting on the side-lines with a blanket over his shoulders, waiting for a chance to get into the game. You see, the catch about portrait-painting—I've looked into the thing a bit—is that you can't start painting portraits till people come along and ask you to, and they won't come and ask you to until you've painted a lot first.

Corky was a poor chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was just another proof of his innate idiocy.

She made me feel that there was nothing I wouldn't do for her. She was rather like one of those innocent-tasting American drinks which creep imperceptibly into your system so that, before you know what you're doing, you're starting out to reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way to tell the large man in the corner that, if he looks at you like that, you will knock his head off.

I'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it's Shakespeare—or, if not, it's some equally brainy lad—who says that it's always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole, and more than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping.

Anything that was in your power to be of assistance to us.”.

If you have never been to England, then England is as real to you as Hogwarts. It's just that a lot of people will tell you otherwise, so you'll believe them to not look stupid, that Hogwarts is just fiction.

What's the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don't yield to them?.

What's the use of a great city having temptations if fellows don't yield to them? Makes it so bally discouraging for a great city. Besides, mother told me to keep my.

“No!” he replied firmly. “I didn't do anything of the kind. I drank too much! Much too much. Lots and lots too much! And, what's more, I'm going to do it again! I'm going to do it every night. If ever you see me sober, old top,” he said, with a kind of holy exaltation, “tap me on the shoulder and say, 'Tut! Tut!' and I'll apologize and remedy the defect.”.

Why interfere with life's morning?.

He had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over about ten years, and I didn't wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy.

In a way, I couldn't help sympathizing with the fellow. He had about four weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread over about ten years, and I didn't wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy.

That's always the way in this world. The chappies you'd like to lend money to won't let you, whereas the chappies you don't want to lend it to will do everything except actually stand you on your head and lift the specie out of your pockets.

“I fancy not, sir. Mr. Bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman, but not bright.”.

Bullion—I say I've never worked myself, but I admire any one who earns a living under difficulties, especially a.

So that I came to the conclusion that, if only dear old Bobbie didn't forget to go to the wedding, they had a sporting chance of being quite happy.

Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he might cease to be one. Take my case, for instance. I'm a chump. Well, if I had remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during my life, my size in hats would be about number nine. But I didn't. I forgot them.

It was the thin edge of the wedge, you see, and she knew it.

It was the thin edge of the wedge, you see, and she knew it. A man who forgets what day he was married, when he's been married one year, will forget, at about the end of the fourth, that he's married at all.

She knows I love her just as much as if I were a memorizing freak at the halls.” “That's not enough for a woman,” I said. “They want to be shown. Bear that in mind, and you're all right. Forget it, and there'll be trouble.”.

“Women are frightfully rummy,” he said gloomily. “You should have thought of that before you married one,” I said.

I had a good deal of time on my hands, but not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie by argument.

I had a good deal of time on my hands, but not enough to amount to anything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie by argument. If you see a man asking for trouble, and insisting on getting it, the only thing to do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him.

But till then there's nothing to be done. But I thought a lot about him.

I was smoking.

I wouldn't bore you, don't you know, for the world, but I think you ought to hear about it.

I spent the afternoon musing on Life. If you come to think of it, what a queer thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don't you know, if you see what I mean. At any moment you may be strolling peacefully along, and all the time Life's waiting around the corner to fetch you one. You can't tell when you may be going to get it. It's all dashed puzzling.

At any moment you may be strolling peacefully along, and all the time Life's waiting around the corner to fetch you one. You can't tell when you may be going to get it. It's all dashed puzzling. Here was poor old George, as well-meaning a fellow as ever stepped, getting swatted all over the ring by the hand of Fate. Why? That's what I asked myself. Just Life, don't you know. That's all there was about.

I got over it, and came to look on the affair as a closed page in the book of my life, if you know what I mean.

Have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married and then been introduced to her husband? If so you'll understand how I felt when Clarence burst on me. You know the feeling. First of all, when you hear about the marriage, you say to yourself, “I wonder what he's like.” Then you meet him, and think, “There must be some mistake. She can't have preferred this to me!” That's what I thought, when I set eyes on Clarence.

He had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point. About once a month he would take three days writing a few poems; the other three hundred and twenty-nine days of the year he rested.

The corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch, and for a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fish's.

You know, I rather think I agree with those poet-and-philosopher Johnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if he has a bit of trouble. All that stuff about being refined by suffering, you know. Suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and more sympathetic outlook. It helps you to understand other people's misfortunes if you've been through the same thing yourself.

I've often heard that chappies, after some great shock or loss, have a habit, after they've been on the floor for a while wondering what hit them, of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together, and sort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life. Time, the great healer, and Nature, adjusting itself, and so on and so forth. There's a lot in it. I know, because in my own case, after a day or two of what you might call prostration, I began to recover. The frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery, but at least I found that I was able to have a dash at enjoying life again. What I mean is, I braced up to the extent of going round the cabarets once more, so as to try to forget, if only for the moment.

He told me once that he could sit on a fence, watching a worm and wondering what on earth it was up to, for hours at a stretch.
