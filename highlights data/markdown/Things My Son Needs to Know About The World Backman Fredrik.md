When those Swiss physicists appeared in the media a couple of years ago talking about their groundbreaking research and the discovery of a ‘previously unknown particle’ that could travel faster than the speed of light, and the entire world was wondering what this new particle might consist of, all parents with small children looked at one another in unison and just said: ‘Poop. I bet anything it’s poop.’.

We want you to be better than us. Because if our kids don’t grow up to be better than us, then what’s the point of all this? We want you to be kinder, smarter, more humble, more generous, and more selfless than we are. We want to give you the very best circumstances we can possibly provide. So we follow sleeping methods and go to seminars and buy ergonomic bathtubs and push car-seat salesmen up against the wall and shout, ‘The safest! I want THE SAFEST, doyouhearme?!’ (Not that I’ve ever done that, of course; you shouldn’t pay so much attention to what your mother.

So indescribably scared of not being good enough. Because we spent so long being the biggest narcissists in world history before we became parents and realized how unimportant we really were.

The realization that you will, from that moment on, draw all your breaths through someone else’s lungs hits you harder when you aren’t prepared.

Let function come before form. Buy the sofa you want, not the sofa you need. Trust me. You’ll never get the chance again.

So find someone who doesn’t love you for the person you are, but despite the person you are.

Focus on the fact that you’ve actually found someone who can see themselves storing their crap in the same place as your crap.

Focus on the fact that you’ve actually found someone who can see themselves storing their crap in the same place as your crap. Because, hand on heart: you have a lot of crap.

People sometimes ask me how I lived before I met your mother. I answer that I didn’t.

Because one day I’ll look away for two seconds and when I turn around again you’ll be all grown up.

So play. Learn. Grow up. Follow your passions. Find someone to love. Do your best. Be kind when you can, tough when you need to be. Hold on to your friends. Don’t go against the direction of the painted arrows in the floor. You’ll be just fine.

When you were born, it was like someone carbonated the air in my lungs. Like you blew bubbles into my blood through a straw. My entire life was about nothing but me for twenty-five years, but then your mother came along and then you came along and now I wake up in the middle of the night several times a week and have to check you’re both still breathing before I can get back to sleep. Can you grasp that? If I’d acted this way before I became someone’s dad, they would have locked me up in a padded cell with an iPod full of dolphin songs.

And I know all kids sooner or later reach a point in their lives where they realize their dads aren’t actually superheroes.

And we can never allow stuff to become more important than people.

They’re not people. They’re Swiss Army knives with beards.

Not because my generation’s skills will be useless in that situation, that’s not what I’m saying at all. We’re just not going to be able to use a single one of them until someone has reinvented electricity.

She’s someone everyone trusts. I can easily think of a hundred people who would follow her blindly into war. I can barely get people to follow me on Twitter.

Want you to always remember that you can become whatever you want to become, but that’s nowhere near as important as knowing that you can be exactly who you are.

Because the only thing you can give to men who already have everything is a second chance. And you’re all of their second chances. Every day.

The one where it says PLEASE STAND BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. I genuinely never feel more spiritual than when I see that line.

As long as you are kind to your mother and don’t murder or steal or start supporting Manchester City or any other horrible thing like that, I genuinely don’t care whether your moral compass is shaped by an old book or a box of jam doughnuts.

Because when you’re with her, it’s always Sunday morning.

All we want is for your psychologists to mutter, in twenty years’ time, that it might not be e-n-t-i-r-e-l-y our fault.

And one of the few ways we can convince ourselves that we’re actually decent as parents is by making other people seem like bad parents.

So, son, let me explain to you that all this that you see around you right now is called ‘life’. It’s going to be complicated at times and it’s going to demand certain things of you. You’ll need to be honest and brave and just. Love and be loved. Fail. Embarrass yourself. Triumph. Fall from something. Fall for someone.

A real friend won’t steal your crush. A real friend won’t ninja loot your warrior in World of Warcraft.

There aren’t really any fundamental requirements for that, of course. But since we’re already on the subject, let’s establish a few all the same: A real friend won’t steal your crush. A real friend won’t ninja loot your warrior in World of Warcraft. Yeah, that’s basically it.

I lumber through life with my hands in my pockets; she dances. I don’t actually know anything she loves doing as much as she loves dancing, and I can’t find the rhythm in a clock. People have said lots of things about us, but trust me, no one has ever said that we were destined for each other.

I want.

I want you to always remember that you can become whatever.

I want you to always remember that you can become whatever you want to become, but that’s nowhere near as important as knowing that you can be exactly who you are.
