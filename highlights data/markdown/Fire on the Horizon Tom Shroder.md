I was aware that it’s not the dangers you anticipate but rather the unforeseen failures that most often give birth to a catastrophe.

If anyone had told me ten years earlier that I would come to love life offshore, I’d have laughed. But I had discovered a reality that few understand or appreciate: the offshore oil field is a magic place where people pit technology against nature to accomplish impossible tasks. It’s a place that more often than not rewards hard work, intelligence, and determination; where degrees and résumés don’t matter; where even a high school diploma is not necessary to lead divisions of men and women.

He had just been to the crew meeting where one of the guys, calling home after a late shift, got word of a blowout on a rig, owned by the world’s largest offshore drilling company, Transocean Ltd., named the Deepwater Horizon.

Whatever your politics, or your feelings about the use of fossil fuels, the fact remains that the world continues to need and demand immense quantities of oil, and in the end, we all rely on these crews of strong, skilled, and determined men and women to bring it home. It’s our obligation to also understand the risks and the pitfalls they face in doing so.

There wasn’t anything he could do about any of it, except sit and watch the flames consume the Horizon. There was nothing to do now but witness her death, just as he had witnessed her birth.

He wasn’t married, so the schedule of twenty-one days on and twenty-one days off didn’t present any family problems, and the rig’s atmosphere—the smell of burning diesel and the constant grind of heavy equipment, the hierarchical command structure—all reminded him of the military.

Roughnecks were pushed hard twelve hours a day by the drillers, who weren’t always picky about their motivational techniques. With the sun beating down hard and no protection from the wind and rain—coupled with the scuffs and bruises of constant manual labor—most roughnecks had the physical proof of their position after a couple of years. Some remained in that job much longer than it took for the skin of their necks to coarsen, but Jason was smart and motivated.

The Deepwater Horizon was to be the first of a new generation of semi-submersibles, the fifth. Previous generations had been inching toward what, in the Horizon, had become almost total computer control of all the rig’s critical functions. On a skeleton of steel and concrete, designers had threaded a web of electric cable that branched out across every surface and bristled with sensors that reported back to computers in the rig’s control centers. This was the rig’s nervous system, and the computers, ordinary PCs, were the brain. The real power was in the software, among the world’s most advanced, capable of considering the millions of data points flooding from the thousands of sensors and instantly interpreting and applying that information to make intelligent decisions concerning the rig’s performance. In addition to registering changes in position, current, and wind for the dynamic positioning system, the sensors alerted the computer to every broken hatch, clogged pipe, overheated engine, and burned-out bulb, every yee and yaw of the drilling platform, each sniffle and sneeze of the ventilation system. It automatically closed hatches to seal out gas-contaminated air, shut down electrical systems to avoid dangerous sparks or risk of electrocution, and sounded evacuation alarms. The builders boasted that these new systems would make the Deepwater Horizon the safest rig ever floated.

There’s a maritime saying that in rough weather, a sailor needs one hand for himself, and one for the ship.

Life, no matter how abundant, ends in death. Every death, no matter how small, is significant.

Contrary to popular myth (and oil company logos), dinosaurs only ruled certain terrestrial neighborhoods of earth—and their corpses didn’t turn into oil.

In many ways the most significant impact on the planet has always been from the smallest life-forms, not the largest.

Microorganisms produced the oxygen that transformed the earth’s atmosphere. And microorganisms are largely responsible for the formation of oil and natural gas deposits, the burning of which is altering the atmosphere once again.

The winner, a BP employee with a literary bent, came up with the name Macondo, after the fictional town created by Gabriel García Márquez and the setting of his masterpiece of magical realism, One Hundred Years of Solitude.

The plan called for the prospect to be drilled in 4,992 feet of water, to a depth 14,569 feet below the ocean floor.

Between the high pressures found deep in the earth, and the explosiveness and toxicity of the payload, poking a steel straw into an oil deposit that had slumbered peacefully for millions of years could turn ugly fast.

There had been a failure to remain vigilant about pressure changes within the well, and a lack of clarity on how to control them. They emphasized that a sense of “complacency” at the end of a well could lead to disaster. They also noted that the blowout had cost them eleven days of work, more than $8 million, and a “significant loss of reputation.” The last thing anyone wanted, they all agreed, was for the same mistakes to lead to a far bigger catastrophe.

It was an ancient story. Flirtation turned into love, love turned into commitment, and a spirited young man found himself making a career and a family instead of another blender of lime daiquiris.

Sailors like to talk about how “salty” something is. It’s simple mariner bravado but, roughly translated, a person or an object is salty to the degree it is linked to the great seafaring traditions reaching across the ages to the Phoenicians, and beyond. Sea beards are salty, black coffee with a pinch of salt is salty, and tattoos of naked mermaids are truly salty. And while plowing through high seas in a midnight gale at ridiculously high latitudes might qualify you as an old salt, spinning circles around a wellhead while the driller calls the shots would certainly not.

Every trip to the rig via helicopter came with another test as well, a test of faith. If you asked rig workers to rank their greatest on-the-job fears, crane accidents, hurricanes, and even blowouts would no doubt rank behind the helicopter commute.

The most important attribute on an oil rig is the ability to work and get along.

Work is the stuff and substance of rig life. Everything is designed to keep the rig working every minute of every day. There are two shifts, each twelve hours a day, seven days a week, with very few breaks. If there’s an ongoing operation on the rig floor, lunch waits. Food is wrapped in tinfoil and put away, devoured when there’s time—even if it’s only five minutes. There are no unions offshore. Only company policy and a supervisor’s goodwill stand between men and exhaustion. If the company wants drillers to work sixteen hours straight, they can make them.

Others, like Dave, spent most of their nonworking, still-conscious time on laptops, chatting with wives or girlfriends, working toward online degrees, starting personal websites.

Most rigs used to have adult channels, but as more women began to arrive, the racier TV fare was purged. Instead, contraband porn DVDs were traded around the rig like baseball cards.

Legend has it that the captain of Transocean’s rig Discoverer Deep Seas, to better demonstrate his elevated status, requisitioned a monster forty-two-inch flat-screen TV that barely fit in his tiny room. Word of the purchase order, approved by the rig manager onshore, leaked out. As soon as the hitch was up, some crew members visited a local florist to order the biggest, gaudiest flower display in the shop, complete with a teddy bear centerpiece and balloons. They sent it to the rig manager with a note that said, “Thank you for the flat-screen TV!” The TV order was promptly canceled.

“Our operations will be conducted in an incident-free workplace—all the time, everywhere.”.

“a START card a day keeps the rig manager away.”.

Someone who is precise but also critical, picky, argumentative, and slow to make decisions. Blue is the color of the feeler, someone who tends to be dependable, agreeable, supportive, and calm, but also reserved, awkward, possessive, and insecure. Curt’s dominant color was yellow—the color for socializers, who, according to the analysis at least, tend to be enthusiastic, optimistic, talkative, persuasive on the upside, disorganized, undisciplined, and at times overconfident on the downside. Curt’s secondary color, red, was common among upper-level supervisors, signifying high ego strength, strong will, a desire for change, but also someone who is pushy, impatient, domineering.

One patch of ocean surface looked the same as another.

To conceive how difficult it is to drop the BOP stack’s connector pipe into the well’s hole, first imagine standing on the observation deck of the Empire State Building and attempting to lower a soda bottle at the end of a 1,200-foot-long string into a garbage can on the sidewalk. It’s extremely windy, and you’re wearing roller skates. Now consider that, with the building encased in clouds, it’s impossible to see the sidewalk, much less the garbage can.

But the first sign of a kick is often seen in the amount of mud that returns. The well bore is filled to the top of the riser with mud. Like a full glass of water held under a faucet, any amount of new mud pumped in should be matched by overflow coming back out. The mud fluid is measured as it goes into the well, pump stroke by pump stroke, and measured again when it comes flooding back out into storage areas called mud pits, which occupy a large portion of the lower deck, just aft of the derrick.

If more mud comes out than was pumped in, that could only mean that something down in the well is pushing back, forcing the mud up and out. That would be the kick. Kicks are fairly common and occur on almost every well. They are nuisances that can become disasters if they aren’t monitored closely and managed adroitly.

Despite its name, mud wasn’t cheap. In fact, it cost far more than refined gasoline, between $200 and $500 per 42-gallon barrel. Formation collapse was called a “lost circulation event” on the rig, because the loss of circulating mud was how it was diagnosed. Thousands of barrels’ worth of mud could escape when a well wall failed, so the mud loss alone could very quickly became a million-dollar problem.

One of his duties as an electronics tech was maintaining the fire and gas detection and alarm system, an extensive network of sensors throughout the rig tied into the rig’s mainframe computer. When he arrived, Mike found it in horrible disarray, with many of the sensors not functioning or locked out. As he set about trying to put things to rights, he stumbled on a page deep in the computer for the rig’s general alarm. He saw that the alarm had been switched to the inhibited mode, which meant it wouldn’t automatically sound if the sensors detected a potentially life-threatening situation. When he reported it, thinking he’d uncovered a serious mistake, he was told that everyone, from the OIM down, wanted it that way, so the crew wasn’t awakened at 3 a.m. for a false alarm. They wanted the watch officers on the bridge, who could see fire/ gas sensor alerts on their computers, to decide if it merited sounding the rig-wide alarm.

Sometimes she wished he didn’t have to work so far away, and stay away so long when he was gone. But she understood, of course. Everybody in rural Mississippi and Louisiana understood.

Janet loved that about her brother, how he could find so much to appreciate in the world. And she loved that he was such a good listener. She always felt safe around him, not just because of his size and his fierce protectiveness, but because she knew he always had her best interests at heart.

“Oh, sis, Scott’s gonna be okay, and you’re a good mother and don’t let anybody tell you any different.”.

Dale put his big bear arm around her and gave her a smile so full of love it made her shiver. He said, “Oh, sis, Scott’s gonna be okay, and you’re a good mother and don’t let anybody tell you any different.”.

And every time the day came for her to drive him to the airport to catch his flight to New Orleans, all the complex calculus of gain and loss would swirl through her mind as another good-bye rushed toward her at sixty miles an hour.

Now he was the OIM, the boss, and the senior drilling hand aboard. Like so many in the Gulf, he was a southerner, born in Mississippi, and a true gentleman, careful to call the men in positions above him, even men years his junior, “Sir,” and all women, regardless of age or position, “Ma’am.” His round face, soulful eyes, and droopy white mustache made him seem approachable, like a favorite uncle. Everyone just called Jimmy “Jimmy,” or “Mr. Jimmy” if they were a junior hand and felt presumptuous addressing the boss by his naked Christian name.

Dewey outlined the final test they would perform to ensure that Macondo was safe, and ready for mud displacement. The procedure was called a “negative test.” In the “positive test” that had been run that morning, pressure had been inserted inside the well casing to see if anything leaked out. The negative test would take pressure off the well, to see if anything leaked in. The test was somewhat complicated and would take some time.

Later analysis indicated that low charge in a battery in the blue control pod and a faulty solenoid valve in the yellow pod rendered the dead man function inactive.

Twenty attempts by Daun and his team to directly force various blowout preventer rams shut using the ROV all failed to stop the.

Long before it crashed into the mud, the riser ruptured and began spewing crude oil into the Gulf at a rate of as much as two and a half million gallons a day.

“But it’s just like with the rig. I think it’s going to happen again in ten years. That’s what humans do, right? They get cautious for a while, and then they forget.”.
