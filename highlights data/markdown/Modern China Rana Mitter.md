Confucianism is based on ideas of mutual obligation, maintenance of hierarchies, a belief in self-development, education, and improvement, and above all, an ordered society.

The ultimate ideal was to become sufficiently wise to attain the status of “sage” (sheng), but one should at least strive to become a junzi, often translated as “gentleman,” but perhaps best thought of as meaning “a person of integrity.”.

Nor was he the only thinker to shape early China: unlike Confucius and Mencius, who believed in the essential good nature of human beings, Xunzi believed that humans were essentially evil; and Han Feizi went further to argue that only a system of strict laws and harsh punishments, not ethical codes, could restrain people from doing wrong.
