Nor was she old enough to appreciate the injustice, to see that it is the creators of the harami who are culpable, not the harami, whose only sin is being born.

“You couldn’t stretch a leg here without poking a poet in the ass,” he laughed.

“Learn this now and learn it well, my daughter: Like a compass needle that points north, a man’s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.”.

A man’s heart is a wretched, wretched thing, Mariam.

A man’s heart is a wretched, wretched thing, Mariam. It isn’t like a mother’s womb. It won’t bleed, it won’t stretch to make room for you.

You’re afraid, Nana, she might have said. You’re afraid that I might find the happiness you never had. And you don’t want me to be happy. You don’t want a good life for me. You’re the one with the wretched heart.

‘Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may try you.’.

“That’s one thing I can’t stand,” he said, scowling, “the sound of a woman crying. I’m sorry. I have no patience for it.” “I want to go home,”.

“That’s one thing I can’t stand,” he said, scowling, “the sound of a woman crying. I’m sorry. I have no patience for it.”.

Rasheed himself believed none of this. In his opinion, superstitions were largely a female preoccupation.

And Allah is the East and the West, therefore wherever you turn there is Allah’s purpose.

She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how women like us suffer, she’d said. How quietly we endure all that falls upon us.

Treacherous daughters did not deserve to be mothers, and this was just punishment.

Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over all things, Who created death and life that He may try you.

“You make the night to pass into the day and You make the day to pass into the night, and You bring forth the living from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living, and You give sustenance to whom You please without measure.”.

“I am not going to cry! Not over you. Not in a thousand years.”.

Like the accordion on which Tariq’s father sometimes played old Pashto songs, time stretched and contracted depending on Tariq’s absence or presence.

I know you’re still young, but I want you to understand and learn this now, he said. Marriage can wait, education cannot. You’re a very, very bright girl. Truly, you are. You can be anything you want, Laila. I know this about you. And I also know that when this war is over, Afghanistan is going to need you as much as its men, maybe even more. Because a society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated, Laila. No chance.

All the hardships a person had to face none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.

Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.

Babi had wiped his eyeglasses clean with the hem of his shirt. To me, it’s nonsense—and very dangerous nonsense at that—all this talk of I’m Tajik and you’re Pashtun and he’s Hazara and she’s Uzbek. We’re all Afghans, and that’s all that should matter. But when one group rules over the others for so long . . . There’s contempt. Rivalry. There is. There always has been.

Boys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.

“I thought about it the night we got the news,” Mammy said. “I won’t lie to you, I’ve thought about it since too. But, no. Don’t worry, Laila. I want to see my sons’ dream come true. I want to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the day the Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free,.

“I thought about it the night we got the news,” Mammy said. “I won’t lie to you, I’ve thought about it since too. But, no. Don’t worry, Laila. I want to see my sons’ dream come true. I want to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the day the Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys see it too. They’ll see it through my eyes.”.

If you’re not careful, people will talk.” Laila opened her mouth to say something. It.

If you’re not careful, people will talk.”.

Smile, and this thick, thick black hair!” Giti had told Laila. No one.

You?” Laila tapped her foot. “Tell your secret to the wind, but don’t blame it for telling the trees.”.

“Tell your secret to the wind, but don’t blame it for telling the trees.”.

Tariq knew this. He knew she could not wipe away the obligations of her life any more than he could his, but it went on, his pleadings and her rebuttals, his proposals and her apologies, his tears and hers. In the end, Laila had to make him leave.

“You’re on a deserted island. You can have five books. Which do you choose? I never thought I’d actually have to.” “We’ll have to start you a new collection, Babi.”.

“One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.”.

Frantically to commit it all to memory, what happened next. Like an art lover running out of a burning museum, she would grab whatever she could—a look, a.

Like an art lover running out of a burning museum, she would grab whatever she could—a look, a whisper, a moan—to salvage from perishing, to preserve. But time is the most unforgiving of fires, and she couldn’t, in the end, save it all.

“This is why the Holy Koran forbids sharab. Because it always falls on the sober to pay for the sins of the drunk. So it does.”.

“The Chinese say it’s better to be deprived of food for three days than tea for one.”.

Now—Laila could still remember Babi saying of those years of communist rule, It’s a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan, Laila. Since the Mujahideen takeover in April 1992, Afghanistan’s name had been changed to the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court under Rabbani was filled now with hardliner mullahs who did away with the communist-era decrees that empowered women and instead passed rulings based on Shari’a, strict Islamic laws that ordered women to cover, forbade their travel without a male relative, punished adultery with stoning. Even if the actual enforcement of these laws was sporadic at best. But they’d enforce them on us more, Laila had said to Mariam, if they weren’t so busy killing each other. And.

Even the snakebitten man finds sleep, but not the hungry.

One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.

Marveling at how every Afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief.

A woman who will be like a rock in a riverbed, enduring without complaint, her grace not sullied but shaped by the turbulence that washes over her.

Not long ago, women in Afghanistan were professors at universities, they were doctors and lawyers, worked in hospitals, taught at schools and played an important role in society. They were women like my mother, who was university educated and a teacher of Farsi and history, eventually becoming the vice principal of a very large high school for girls. But that was in Kabul, and Afghanistan is not a nation of urbanized middle-class people. There has always been an ideological gap between liberal reformist Kabul and rural Afghanistan.

There was a king named Amanullah in the 1920s who actually banned the wearing of the burqa in public.
