This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is. Especially if you have other people you’re trying to be a reasonably good human being for.

Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye.

‘If your head isn’t up to the job, your legs better be!’.

It should be noted that this particular bank robber had the same level of fitness as the average thirty-nine-year-old. Not one of those big-city thirty-nine-year-olds who deal with their midlife crisis by buying ridiculously expensive cycling shorts and swimming caps because they have a black hole in their soul that devours Instagram pictures, more the sort of thirty-nine-year-old whose daily consumption of cheese and carbohydrates was more likely to be classified medically as a cry for help rather than a diet.

Because everyone loves someone, and anyone who loves someone has had those desperate nights where we lie awake trying to figure out how we can afford to carry on being human beings. Sometimes that makes us do things that seem ridiculous in hindsight, but which felt like the only way out at the time.

It’s the day before New Year’s Eve in a not particularly large town.

Because you’ve probably been depressed yourself, you’ve had days when you’ve been in terrible pain in places that don’t show up in X-rays, when you can’t find the words to explain it even to the people who love you.

At the end of your career you’re trying to find a point to it all, and at the start of it you’re looking for a purpose.

One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon.

Older men rarely know what to say to younger men to let them know that they care.

Older men rarely know what to say to younger men to let them know that they care. It’s so hard to find the words when all you really want to say is: ‘I can see you’re hurting.’.

‘Do you know what the worst thing about being a parent is? That you’re always judged by your worst moments.

Then the man explained that he’d had a pretty good job, he’d set up his own relatively successful business, bought a fairly nice apartment. That he’d invested all his savings in shares in a property development company, so that his children could get even better jobs and even nicer apartments, so that they could have the freedom not to have to worry, not have to fall asleep exhausted every night with a pocket calculator in their hands. Because that was a parent’s job: to provide shoulders. Shoulders for your children to sit on when they’re little so they can see the world, then stand on when they get older so they can reach the clouds, and sometimes lean against whenever they stumble and feel unsure.

I’m one of those penguins that squats on top of a stone because I don’t want to accept that the egg has gone.

‘She said I’m overprotective. That I’m one of those penguins that squats on top of a stone because I don’t want to accept that the egg has gone. She said you can’t protect your kids from life, because life gets us all in the end.’.

The estate agent takes a deep breath and says what women usually say to men who never seem to think that their lack of knowledge should get in the way of a confident opinion. ‘I’m sure you’re right.’.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them. One generation got told off for not being able to sit still, the next gets told off for never moving.

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them. One generation got told off for not being able to sit still, the next gets told off for never moving. So when Jim writes a report he hits every key all the way down very deliberately, then checks the screen at once to make sure it hasn’t tricked him, and only then does he press the next key. Because Jim isn’t the sort of man who lets himself be tricked. Jack, in turn, types the way young men who’ve never lived in a world without the Internet do, he can do it blindfolded, stroking the keys so gently that even a forensics expert wouldn’t be able to prove that he’d touched them.

When the son is looking for something on the Internet, he calls it ‘googling,’ but when his dad does the same thing he says: ‘I’ll look that up on Google.’ When they disagree about something, the father says: ‘Well, it must be right, because I read it on Google!’ and the son exclaims: ‘You don’t actually read things on Google, Dad, you search for them there …’.

Jim is slow, Jack efficient. Jim tells a story; Jack simply gives a report. Jim deletes and edits and starts again, Jack just types and types as if there were nothing on the planet that could be described in more than one way.

Jim is slow, Jack efficient. Jim tells a story; Jack simply gives a report. Jim deletes and edits and starts again, Jack just types and types as if there were nothing on the planet that could be described in more than one way. In his youth Jim had dreams of becoming a writer. In fact he was still dreaming about that until long into Jack’s childhood.

That’s an impossible thing for sons to grasp, and a source of shame for fathers to have to admit: that we don’t want our children to pursue their own dreams or walk in our footsteps. We want to walk in their footsteps while they pursue our dreams.

Jim used to think that children were like kites, so he held on to the string as tightly as he could, but eventually the wind carried her off anyway.

Drugs are a sort of dusk that grant us the illusion that we’re the ones who decide when the light goes out, but that power never belongs to us. The darkness takes us whenever it likes.

He presses his thumbs hard against his eyebrows, as if he hopes they’re two buttons and if he keeps them pressed at the same time for ten seconds he’ll be able to restore life to its factory settings.

Most adults have had a number of really bad moments, and of course not even fairly happy people manage to be happy the whole darn time.

One likes coffee, the other tea. One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon.

One likes coffee, the other tea. One looks at his watch while they’re working to see if it will soon be lunchtime, the other looks at his watch during lunch to see if he can get back to work soon. The older man thinks the most important thing is for a police officer to do the right thing, the younger thinks it’s more important to do things correctly.

‘There are days when I can’t help thinking you never really came back from that bridge, love. That you’re still trying to save that man on the railing, even though it’s as impossible now as it was back then.’.

Jim didn’t say a word when Jack sat down at his computer after his outburst. But when the coffee cup hit the wall, it wasn’t Jack who threw it. Because even if his son was furious about not being able to save the perpetrator’s life, and hated the fact that a group of damn Stockholmers were about to show up and take the investigation away from him, that came nowhere close to the frustration his father felt at not being able to help him.

It’s easier to talk about work when you haven’t quite got the words to talk about the other things in life, but obviously those words apply to both things at the same time.

Too much time has passed for the father to ask his son how he’s doing, too much time for the son to be able to explain.

He comes back with two more cups. Not that Jack drinks coffee, but he understands that it occasionally means something to his father not to have to drink alone.

We lie to those we love.

It’s hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it’s full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, alcohol-free beer.

She hoped they were, because sometimes it’s easier to live with your own anxieties if you know that no one else is happy, either.

Tall people have feelings, too, you know.

‘Nothing’s entirely risk-free, you should have known what you were getting into, you shouldn’t have given us your money.’.

‘when one party in an agreement is protected against the negative consequences of its own actions.’.

‘life can go all sorts of different ways, but it will probably go wrong.’.

But how many people do you have to save in order to be allowed to kill someone?.

Let’s take a much simpler example, then: Are you allowed to steal? No, you mustn’t steal. We agree on that. Except when you steal someone’s heart, because that’s romantic. Or if you steal harmonicas from guys who play the harmonica at parties, because that’s being public spirited. Or if you steal something small because you really have to. That’s probably okay. But does that mean it’s okay to steal something a bit bigger? And who decides how much bigger? If you really have to steal, how much do you have to have to do it in order for it to be reasonable to steal something really serious? For instance, if you feel that you really have to and that no one will get hurt: Is it okay to rob a bank then?.

It's funny how the most afraid people on the planet are the ones with small children. Some people are afraid of their own life, but most peope are afraid for the lives that depend on them.

Except fear,.

Possibly because the bank robber had small children and had therefore had a lot of practice being afraid.

So every so often they do tiny, tiny things at the most peculiar times, to buoy us up a little. Just enough to stop us from drowning.

It’s possible that some children realize this. So every so often they do tiny, tiny things at the most peculiar times, to buoy us up a little. Just enough to stop us from drowning.

Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super-smart and really funny and immortal.

And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super-smart and really funny and immortal. Perhaps there’s a biological reason for that, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and hopelessly for one single reason: you’re theirs. Which is a pretty smart move on biology’s part, you have to give it that.

We give those we love nicknames, because love requires a word that belongs to us alone.

The bank robber parent never uses the girls’ real names. That’s the sort of thing you never really notice until you belong to someone else, the fact that those of us who give children their names are the least willing to use them.

You probably have someone in your life whom you’d do something stupid for.

One frog. One monkey. And an elk that would do anything for them.

So the bank robber parent always calls the girls what they used to feel like, kicking in their mother’s belly six and eight years ago. One of them always seemed to be jumping about in there, and the other always seemed to be climbing. One frog. One monkey. And an elk that would do anything for them. Even when it’s completely stupid. Perhaps you have that in common after all. You probably have someone in your life whom you’d do something stupid for.

It’s possible for someone to be unfaithful to you without really thinking about you at all, but an affair requires planning. Perhaps that’s what hurts most of all, the millions of tiny clues that you didn’t notice. Maybe you’d have been even more crushed if there wasn’t even a good explanation. For instance, maybe you could have understood if it was about loneliness or desire, ‘You’re always at work and we never have any time for each other.’ But if the explanation is ‘Well, er, if you want me to be really honest, the person I’ve been unfaithful with is your boss,’ then it can be harder to get back up again. Because that means that the reason you’ve been working so much overtime is also the same reason why you no longer have a marriage.

Because that means that the reason you’ve been working so much overtime is also the same reason why you no longer have a marriage. When you get to work on the Monday after the break-up, your boss says: ‘Well, er, obviously it’s going to be uncomfortable for everyone involved, so … perhaps it would be easiest if you no longer worked here.’.

Once the frog said she’d heard an adult on the bus say ‘love hurts’, and the monkey replied that maybe that’s why hearts end up jagged when you try to draw them. How.

The truth, of course, is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn’t spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who’s having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit.

‘masked and fairly small. Not really small, but normally small! Maybe more normal than small! But what’s normal?’.

Being a Stockholmer was more a state of mind than a description of geographic origin.

‘Not all idiots are Stockholmers, but all Stockholmers are idiots,’ as.

Being a Stockholmer was more a state of mind than a description of geographic origin. ‘Not all idiots are Stockholmers, but all Stockholmers are idiots,’ as people often said at the police station. Which was obviously extremely unfair. Because it’s possible to stop being an idiot, but you can’t stop being a Stockholmer.

‘What do you want me to do?’ Jim asked, because he needed to be needed.

Turned out that one of them couldn’t live with the fact that the other one had such ugly shoes, and the other was turned off by the fact that the first dribbled when he brushed his teeth, and that both of them would rather have a partner who wasn’t quite so short.

It turned out that one of them couldn’t live with the fact that the other one had such ugly shoes, and the other was turned off by the fact that the first dribbled when he brushed his teeth, and that both of them would rather have a partner who wasn’t quite so short.

If you’re constantly presented with alternatives, you can never make up your mind, Jim thought.

If you’re constantly presented with alternatives, you can never make up your mind, Jim thought. How could anyone live with the stress of knowing that while their partner was in the bathroom, they could be swiping right or left and finding their soulmate.

If you’re constantly presented with alternatives, you can never make up your mind, Jim thought. How could anyone live with the stress of knowing that while their partner was in the bathroom, they could be swiping right or left and finding their soulmate? A whole generation would end up getting urinary tract infections because they had to keep waiting to pee until the charge on their partner’s phone ran out.

Is that phrase too hard to understand?.

You’re about as sharp as a wet box of cornflakes, aren’t you?.

‘Sometimes it’s hard to know who the biggest crooks are, people who rob banks, or the people who run the banks.’.

‘You need psychology if you think you’re a dolphin. You need psychiatry if you’ve killed all the dolphins.’.

‘I’d say that a panic attack is when psychological pain becomes so strong that it manifests itself physically. The anxiety becomes so acute that the brain can’t … well, in the absence of any better words, I’d say that the brain doesn’t have sufficient bandwidth to process all the information. The firewall collapses, so to speak. And anxiety overwhelms us.’.

Your generation don’t want to study a subject, you just want to study yourselves.’.

‘democracy as a system is doomed, because idiots will believe anything as long as the story’s good enough.’.

‘I don’t know what happiness is for her.’.

‘I didn’t say that money was happiness. I said happiness is like money. A made-up value that represents something we can’t weigh or measure.’.

‘That’s because people like you always look at people who are wealthier than you are and say: “Yes, they may be richer, but are they happy?” As if that was the meaning of life for anyone but a complete idiot, just going around being happy all the time.’.

‘Having a purpose. A goal. A direction. And do you want to know the truth? The truth is that far more people would rather be rich than happy.’.

That’s a relief, because what you think really matters to me. Can I go now?.

One: Are the actions of the person in question intended to harm you personally? Two: Do you possess all the information about the situation? Three: Do you have anything to gain from a conflict?’.

‘Why would I need help to stop getting into conflicts? Conflicts are good. Only weak people believe in harmony, and as a reward they get to float through life with a feeling of moral superiority while the rest of us get on with other things.’.

‘I buy distance from other people.’.

The most expensive thing you can buy in the most densely populated places on the planet is distance.’.

Do you think there are bad people?’.

We’re just strangers passing each other, your anxieties briefly brushing against mine as the fibres of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded pavement somewhere.

We’re just strangers passing each other, your anxieties briefly brushing against mine as the fibres of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded pavement somewhere. We never really know what we do to each other, with each other, for each other.

You can get it into your head to do some unbelievably stupid things when you run out of tears, when you can’t silence the voices no one else can hear, when you’ve never been in a room where you felt normal.

Because nothing unites a group of strangers more effectively than the opportunity to come together and sigh at a hopeless case.

People don’t want to buy a picture, they want to buy a frame.

You can always tell by the way people who love each other argue: the longer they’ve been together, the fewer words they need to start a fight.

They were always stressing about something, but without having anything they truly needed to hurry for.

At this Roger stopped kicking the skirting board, turned towards his wife, and looked her deep in the eye. Then he said four little words that he never said to any other woman on the planet. He said: ‘For God’s sake, darling.’.

When you’ve been stuck with each other long enough it can seem like there’s no difference between no longer arguing and no longer caring.

That’s the only thing someone who definitely wants to live and someone who definitely wants to die have in common: if you’re going to jump off something, you need to be pretty damn sure of the height.

Every third month Ro would become obsessed with something, 1950s dresses or bouillabaisse or antique coffee services or CrossFit or bonsai trees or a podcast about the Second World War, then she would spend three months studying the subject in question with unstinting devotion on Internet forums populated by people who clearly shouldn’t be allowed Wi-Fi in whatever padded cell they were locked up in, and then she would suddenly get fed up and immediately find a new obsession.

When you’ve been together for a very long time, it’s the little things that matter. In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say ‘I love you’, either.

When you’ve been together for a very long time, it’s the little things that matter. In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say ‘I love you’, either. Once when they were at IKEA, very recently, Roger had suggested when they were having lunch in the cafeteria that they each have a piece of cake. Because he understood that it was an important day for Anna-Lena, and because it was important to her, it was important to him as well. Because that’s how he loves her.

Can you imagine what a bad parent you must have been for your children not to want to be parents?.

That was the evening she went from being hopelessly infatuated to irrevocably in love.

They have a definition for what counts as personal, Julia and Ro, even though Julia is the only one who knows what that definition is.

‘Really? Tell me about all the Nobel Prize winners who grew up in Amish communities.’.

Anna-Lena had become interested in interior design late in life, but she had read in a book that every designer needed an ‘anchor’ in each new scheme. Something solid and definite that everything else can build upon, spreading out from it in ever-increasing circles. For Anna-Lena, that anchor was her bathroom cabinet. Roger understood that, because he appreciated the value of immovable objects, such as load-bearing walls. You can’t make them adapt to you, you simply have to adapt to them. So Roger always unscrewed the bathroom cabinet last of all whenever they moved out of an apartment, and installed it first when they arrived at the new one. That was how he loved her.

A man wants to be looked in the eye and told the truth when he’s no longer needed. But they faked it.

‘Thanks for that, you’re a real tonic. You’re like a self-help book, only in reverse.’.

I’m so positive that it makes people depressed.

“Now you’ll have to learn to cry in the cupboard, Jules, because children get frightened if you cry in front of them.”’.

Because on the news that morning there was a man, a politician, who said we ought to stop helping immigrants. That they just come here thinking they can get everything for free, and that a society can’t work like that.

‘We argue a lot about politics, Roger and I, we have very different opinions, but you can always … I think you can understand someone without necessarily agreeing with them, if you see what I mean? And I know people sometimes think Roger’s a bit of an idiot, but he isn’t always an idiot in the way people assume.’.

‘Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.’.

‘Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.’ Her son loved her, but she never managed to get him to believe in God, because although you might be able to drum religion into people, you can’t teach faith. But that night, all alone at the end of a dimly lit corridor in a hospital where she had held so many dying people by the hand, Jack sank to his knees and asked God not to take his mum away from him.

Addicts are addicted to their drugs, and their families are addicted to hope.

Drowning.’ Jack couldn’t help his sister.

‘We can’t change the world, and a lot of the time we can’t even change people. No more than one bit at a time. So we do what we can to help whenever we get the chance, sweetheart. We save those we can. We do our best. Then we try to find a way to convince ourselves that that will just have to … be enough. So we can live with our failures without drowning.’ Jack couldn’t help his sister.

She just walked right out into the street in front of us!’.

‘I don’t think we agree about everything, but I have a feeling He knows I’m doing the best I can. And I think maybe He knows I work for Him, because I try to help people.’.

‘Boats that stay in the harbour are safe, sweetheart, but that’s not what boats were built for.’.

‘God doesn’t protect people from knives, sweetheart. That’s why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.’.

The psychologist coughed, the way you do if your throat takes offence at you being predictable.

‘Because I can see that you don’t want to let people get close to you. It makes you feel weak. But I don’t think you’re afraid of being hurt, I think you’re afraid of hurting other people. You’re a more empathetic and moral person than you like to admit.’.

‘But do we really need penguins?’.

I’m not saying you’ve got a fork, but if you had a knife?’.

So not even really rich people ever feel really rich, because in the end the only thing you can buy is a more expensive version of something you’ve already got. With borrowed money.’.

‘I heard a man who worked in a casino say that no one gets ruined by losing, they get ruined by trying to win back the money they lost. Is that what you mean? Is that why the stock market and housing market crash?’.

‘So do you feel more guilty about the customers you haven’t lent money to, or the ones you’ve lent too much to?’.

Do you know how many men like you every single woman on the planet meets every day, who think that every thought that pops into your tiny little male brains is a lovely present you can give us?’.

More people should do that, ask if you’re hungry instead of how you’re feeling.

‘You have to listen to each other all the time. But not all the time. If you listen to each other all the time, there’s a risk that you can’t forgive each other afterwards.’.

‘When we first fell in love, Knut and I reached an agreement about how we were allowed to argue, because Knut said that sooner or later the first flush of infatuation wears off and you end up arguing whether you like it or not. So we came to an agreement, like the Geneva Convention, where the rules of war were agreed. Knut and I promised that no matter how angry we got, we weren’t allowed to consciously say things just to hurt each other. We weren’t allowed to argue just for the sake of winning. Because, sooner or later, that would end up with one of us winning. And no marriage can survive that.’ ‘Did it work?’ Julia asked. ‘I don’t know,’ Estelle admitted. ‘No?’ ‘We never got past the first flush of infatuation.’ There was no point even trying not to like her just then.

‘Alcoholics don’t have unopened bottles of wine in the house. They have empty wine bottles.’.

He says you end up marrying the one you don’t understand. Then you spend the rest of your life trying.

‘you have to live your life in such a way that you become friends with death’,.

‘To die will be an awfully big adventure.’.

People’s dreams are always at their grandest when they’re looking for somewhere to live.

If you can do something for someone in such a way that they think they managed it all on their own, then you’ve done a good job.’.

“You can’t live long with the ones who are only beautiful, Jules. But the funny ones, oh, they last a lifetime!”’.

She’s my everyday. The whole … world.’.

‘Your mum was right, the ones who make you laugh last a lifetime,’.

Then she thought about an American author who had written that loneliness is like starvation, you don’t realize how hungry you are until you begin to eat.

‘You don’t have to like all children. Just one. And children don’t need the world’s best parents, just their own parents. To be perfectly honest with you, what they need most of the time is a chauffeur.’.

‘Are you going to do all you can, Julia? Are you going to protect the child with your life? Are you going to sing to it and read it stories and promise that everything will feel better tomorrow?’.

‘Are you going to raise it so that it doesn’t grow up to be one of those idiots who don’t take their backpack off when they’re on public transport.

Estelle was thinking about another author now, one who almost a hundred years ago wrote that your children aren’t your children, they’re the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself.

He used to say authors were like musicians who never get to the point.

He read such wonderful things. I don’t have the words to describe it, but it was like going on a journey with someone. Where didn’t matter.

‘Because you dance with the person you went to the party with. And I went with Knut.’.

It’s such an odd thing, the way you can know someone so perfectly through what they read.

Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and she was no longer making any attempt to stop them.

‘Obviously I can’t set a good example to my daughters and teach them not to do idiotic things now. But I might at least be able to show them how you take responsibility for your actions.’.

So Jim concluded there and then that the only way she wouldn’t get punished was not to catch her.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree. Because then I thought that sooner or later … and this sounds so pretentious … but I thought that sooner or later we’d end up on the same branch.

And I kept telling myself that the important thing was that we kept climbing the same tree. Because then I thought that sooner or later … and this sounds so pretentious … but I thought that sooner or later we’d end up on the same branch. And then we could sit there holding hands and looking at the view. That’s what I thought we’d be doing when we got old. But time goes quicker than you think.

‘My mum always says I should never apologize for myself. Never say sorry for being good at something.’.

We are asleep until we fall in love.

‘Send me a text when you’re safe, otherwise I’ll worry.’.

‘You’re not always such a damn good police officer, Dad.’ Jack will grin up at the clouds. He’ll want to add but I’ve learned everything else from you, but the words won’t quite come out.

‘There’s something romantic about the thought of all the apartments that aren’t for sale.’.

Nothing must happen to you No, what am I saying Everything must happen to you And it must be wonderful.

Anna-Lena stretches out her fingers towards his. She wants to say sorry. So does he. It’s a harder word than you might think, when you’ve been climbing trees for so long.

Then, eventually, a night will come which will be Estelle’s last night without Knut, and everyone else’s last night with Estelle.

Somewhere, in some sort of heaven, Estelle will be listening to music with one man and talking about literature with another. She’s earned that.

He never used to talk to her like that, but late in life even computer programmers become poets.

Dads are dads and daughters are daughters, and not even psychologists can quite come to terms with that.

Most people aren’t greedy, most people are just … like you said when we were talking about the picture: they’re just looking for something to cling on to.

‘Not knowing is a good place to start.’.

Sometimes we don’t need distance, just barriers.

Men and women going around for months having trouble breathing and seeing doctor after doctor because they think there’s something wrong with their lungs. All because it’s so damn difficult to admit that something else is … broken. That it’s an ache in our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us, telling us we’re going to die. But there’s nothing wrong with our lungs, Zara. We’re not going to die, you and I.’ The.

They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.

Because it’s the duty of children not to pay the slightest bit of attention to their parents.

How terrible must your real life feel to require this much … escape? All the creatures were happy, they lived in peace, and there was no pain in their little world.

Because perhaps it’s true what they say, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and uncontrollably for one simple reason: you’re theirs. Your parents and siblings can love you for the rest of your life, too, for precisely the same reason.

The truth. There isn’t any. All we’ve managed to find out about the boundaries of the universe is that it hasn’t got any, and all we know about God is that we don’t know anything.

We’re not in control. So we learn to pretend, all the time, about our jobs and our marriages and our children and everything else.

We pretend we’re normal, that we’re reasonably well educated, that we understand ‘amortization levels’ and ‘inflation rates’. That we know how sex works. In truth, we know as much about sex as we do about USB leads, and it always takes us four tries to get those little buggers in. (Wrong way round, wrong way round, wrong way round, there! In!).

Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn’t feel like it’s ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don’t know how, because it’s so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.
