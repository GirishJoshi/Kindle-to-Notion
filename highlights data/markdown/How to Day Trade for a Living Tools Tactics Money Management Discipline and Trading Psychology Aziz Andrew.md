Success in trading is not a revolution, it is an evolution.

In my opinion, the most important lesson that you can learn from reading this book is that you will not get rich quickly by day trading. Day trading is not similar to gambling or playing the lottery. This is the most important misconception that people have about day trading and I hope you will come to the same conclusion after reading this book.

The release of the records of financial brokers. Those records indicated that after six months of trading, only 16% of day traders actually made money.

Trading in a simulator account is expediting your learning curve exponentially.

And, once you begin trading with your real money, you need to treat it as your job, as your career, and as your profession. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You need to enter each trade with a well-thought-out plan and then stick to it. As I am fond of saying, you need to stick to your trading plans like glue! You cannot allow your emotions to get the better of you in the midst of a trade.

An average successful day trader can make between $500 and $1,000 every day.

I will explain specific reasons behind this important question in Chapters 8 and 9 but, overall, in my opinion, the most common reason that people fail in day trading is that they do not regard it as a serious business.

Others decide to become involved in trading because they think it will be fun or entertaining, or an interesting hobby of some kind. They might be attracted to trading because they consider it a “cool” thing to do, something that will bring them prestige or perhaps make them more attractive to others.

I always advise individuals to budget at least $1,500 for education for their first year. Yes, $1,500 might be a lot of money for one week or one month of training, but over the course of your lifetime, it is a very manageable investment, even for people who are not financially blessed but are ready to begin trading.

It always amazes me when I see people start a new business without proper education and training.

Seek a solid education and practice for at least three months in simulators before trading with real money.

In reality, trading isn't about “always” at all; it is about each situation that presents itself and it is about each individual trade.

When traders are undercapitalized but still hope to trade for a living, they are more likely to take higher risks to achieve their desired returns. That, unfortunately, will most likely destroy their account.

First, you’re looking for stocks that are moving in a relatively predictable manner. Secondly, you are going to trade them in one day. You will not keep any position overnight. If you buy stock in Apple (ticker: AAPL) today, for instance, you will not hold your position overnight and sell it tomorrow. If you hold onto any stock overnight, it is no longer day trading, it’s called swing trading.

Swing trading is a form of trading in which you hold stocks over a period of time, generally from one day to a few weeks. It is a completely different style of trading, and you shouldn’t use the strategies and tools that you use for day trading to do swing trading. Do you remember Rule 2, where I mentioned that day trading is a business? Swing trading is also a business, but a completely different kind of business.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading.

Many traders, including myself, do both day trading and swing trading. We are aware that we are running two different businesses, and we have gone through separate educational programs for these two kinds of trading.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight.

Swing traders usually look for stocks in solid companies that they know won’t lose their entire value overnight. For day trading, however, you can trade anything, including companies that will soon go bankrupt, because you don’t care what happens after the market closes. In fact, many of the companies that you will day trade are too risky to hold overnight because they might lose much of their value in that short of a period of time.

Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans.

Often, many of the stocks we day trade will lose even more of their value overnight. As a day trader, you must stick to your daily plans. You should never change a day trade that was supposed to close at the end of the day into a swing trade. It’s a common human inclination to accept profits quickly and to also want to wait until losing trades return to even.

When I sit down with them and listen to their expectations, I realize that most of them want to invest their money, they are not looking for a new or additional career as a trader.

How I can make money today is my obsession and my expertise.

Day traders buy stocks in the hope that their price will go higher. This is called buying long , or simply long.

“I am long 100 shares AAPL,” it means that we have bought 100 shares of Apple Inc. and would like to sell them higher for a profit.

Day traders can borrow shares from their broker and sell them, hoping that the price will go lower and that they can then buy those shares back at a lower price and make a profit.

Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up.

Short sellers profit when the price of the stock they borrowed and sold drops. Short selling is important because stock prices usually drop much more quickly than they go up. Fear is a more powerful feeling than greed. Therefore, short sellers, if they trade right, can make astonishing profits while other traders panic and start to sell off.

However, like anything in the market that has great potential, short selling has its risks too. When buying stocks of a company for $5, the worst case scenario is that the company goes bankrupt and you lose your $5 per share. There is a limit to your loss. But if you short sell that company at $5 and then the price, instead of going down, starts going higher and higher, then there won’t be any limit to your loss. The price may go to $10, $20, or $100, and still there will be no limit to your loss. Your broker wants those shares back. Not only can you lose all of the money in your account, but your broker can also sue you for more money if you do not have sufficient funds to cover your shorts.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher.

If there were no short sellers, the price of stocks could unreasonably increase higher and higher. Short sellers are balancing the market and adjusting prices to their reasonable value. Their actions are conducive to the health of the market.

Strategy. Having said that, I am more careful.

Notwithstanding that fact, individual traders have a tremendous advantage over institutional traders. Banks and other institutions are compelled to trade, often in large volumes, and sometimes with little regard to price. They are expected to be constantly active in the market. Individual traders, on the other hand, can decide whether or not they want to trade, and they can bide their time until opportunities present themselves.

One hundred shares is low-risk, and although it’s also a low reward for the trader, you need to start somewhere. New traders should start out with trading 100 shares. If their stop loss hits, they really have no excuse about why they couldn’t get out. Even for an illiquid stock (a stock that is hard to sell) that is traded with very low volume, 100 shares is nothing.

Therefore, you need to find stocks that will make quick moves to the upside or to the downside in a relatively predictable manner.

You will not trade stocks that other retail traders are not trading or not seeing.

The more traders using these strategies, the better they will work. As more people recognize the line in the sand, more people will be buying at that point.

This is why many traders are happy to share their day trading strategies.

I believe one of the most significant challenges with these “black boxes” is that the computer programmers who work so many hours each day on the formulas don’t have a clue how to day trade themselves.

Never forget that in the equally strategic world of chess, Garry Kasparov did win some of his rounds against IBM’s Deep Blue.

Of the various HFT programs that are currently operating, one of the least effective is the so-called “ Buy the New Low” program. When a stock reaches a new intraday low, many day traders will go short to ride the downside momentum. This program then begins to buy the shorts from those day traders to push the price higher. This causes day traders to panic and to cover their shorts. Because the organizations behind HFT programs have almost limitless buying power, the plan sounds flawless. The plan quickly breaks down, however, when another large institutional seller is behind the trade and decides to dump their large positions. This means that regardless of how many shares the program buys, the stock will simply not push higher because institutional sellers and day traders will continue to dump their shares on it.

What works today for traders may not work tomorrow.

For example, when a program forces short sellers to cover fast, ride the short squeeze on the up side with the program.

The market is simply a pattern-solving exercise.

But what we should not do, what a trader must never do, is to make excuses.

As part of the algorithmic trading by computer systems, the majority of the stocks will trend with the overall market unless they have a reason not to.

But, remember, there will be a handful of stocks that will buck the trend of the market because they have a catalyst. These are the Stocks in Play . This is what retail traders are looking for - that small handful of stocks that are going to be running when the markets are tanking, or tanking when the markets are running.

If the market is running, and these stocks are running too, that's fine. You just want to ensure you are trading stocks that are moving because they have a fundamental reason to move and are not just moving with the overall market conditions: Stocks in Play.

When I do reversal trades (Chapter 7), my favorite reversal trades are on stocks that are selling off because there has been some bad news regarding that company.

If there is a quick sell off because of bad news, many people will notice and start monitoring the stock for what is called a Bottom Reversal.

If stocks are trending down with the overall market, such as oil was some time ago, you cannot do a good reversal trade.

Their value pops up by 10 cents, and you think it’s a reversal, but then they are sold off for another 50 cents. They’re selling off because they’re trending with both the overall market and their sector. Oil was a weak sector for a while in 2014 and 2015 and the majority of the oil and energy stocks were selling off. When a sector is weak, that is not a good time to make a reversal trade. That’s where you have to differentiate.

Rule 4: Always ask, “ Is this stock moving because the overall market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst ?”.

That’s when you have to do a little bit of research. As you become more experienced as a trader, you will be able to differentiate between catalyst-based price action and general market trending.

As discussed, as a retail trader, you must be careful that you are not on the wrong side of the trade against institutional traders.

You’re in the wrong place. Focus where everyone else is focused: focus on the stock that is moving every single day and receiving literally a ton of action. That is what day traders will be looking at.

Can you day trade stocks like Apple or Priceline or Coca-Cola or IBM? Of course you can, but these are slow moving stocks that are dominated by institutional traders and algorithmic traders, and in general terms they are going to be very hard to day trade.

As the reader of this book, you are welcome to join our Bear Bull Traders chatroom.

As I mentioned earlier, I’m not a value investor and I’m not a long-term investor. I don’t trade Options or Futures either, but I do use Futures to gain an understanding of the overall market direction in the near-term future. I am an intraday equity (stock) trader. I am also a swing trader. In swing trading, I personally do care very much about the fundamentals of the companies I choose to trade: their earnings, dividends, earnings-per-share, and many other criteria. But swing trading is not the focus of this book, so I won’t pursue that topic for now.

I’m also a Forex (foreign exchange market) trader and sometimes I trade commodities and currencies. But, in the mornings, I am mostly an equities day trader and I focus on the real stocks. The majority of day traders don’t trade penny stocks or on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Penny stocks are extremely manipulated and they do not follow any of the rules of the standard strategies. We trade real stocks. Sometimes we may be trading Facebook (ticker: FB) and sometimes we may be trading Apple (ticker: AAPL), but we will always be trading the stocks that are having a big day. You may be surprised, but on almost every single day in the market, there's a stock having a big day because the company has released earnings, had a newsbreak, or had something bad or good happen to it. These are the fundamental catalysts that you must look for.

You will read about it in detail in Chapter 8, but my trading day typically starts at around 6 a.m. (which is 9 a.m. New York time) with pre-market scanning. I’m scanning to see where there is volume in the market. As early as 8:30 a.m. New York time, you’ll know what stocks are gapping up or gapping down. I then start scouring through the news for catalysts that explain the gaps. I start to put together a watchlist (the list of stocks I will monitor during the trading day). I rule some out and then I pick and choose which ones I do and don’t like. By 9:15 a.m. New York time I am in our chatroom, going over my watchlist with all of our traders. By 9:30 a.m., when the bell rings, my plans are ready.

The advantage of having all of that volume is that it provides liquidity. This means there are plenty of buyers and plenty of sellers, which in turn means that you can easily get in and out of trades.

I personally trade only within the first one or two hours of the market’s opening.

I avoid pre-market trading because there is very low liquidity as there are very few traders trading. That means stocks can pop up a dollar, then drop a dollar, and you can’t get in and out with large shares. You have to go really small, and you have to use such small positions that, for me at least, it's just not worth it. If you don't mind trading in small shares, then you can certainly trade pre-market, but you need to first ensure your broker will allow you to do pre-market trading.

The great advantage for me is that I can be finished trading before many of the people in my city are even out of bed.

You know how easy it is to lose money. Once you have some money in your pocket, you should hold on to it.

I’ve learned, and at times the hard way, that success in day trading comes from initially mastering one proven trading strategy, such as what I have devoted Chapter 7 of this book to; knowing how much to properly enter a trade with and knowing when to properly exit a trade, all without risking any more of your hard-earned money than necessary; and, as has been emphasized several times already in this book, controlling your emotions.

Often, beginner traders who fail to make money in the markets get frustrated and go out and try to learn more about how the markets work, study new strategies, adopt additional technical indicators, follow some different traders, and join other chatrooms.

They don’t realize that the main cause of their failure is often a lack of self-discipline, the making of impulsive decisions and sloppy risk and money management, not their technical knowledge.

You are the only problem you will ever have for your trading career and, of course, you are the only solution to this problem.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you.

But, before you begin your first trading day, you have to realize and accept in your mind that there will be days when you will lose money. Maybe even very badly. It happens to the most experienced of traders and it will happen to you. Something completely unexpected can happen in the middle of your trade. Please believe me, there is no magic formula for success.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”.

One of my favorite trading expressions is “live to play another day”. This simple saying says so much about the mindset of a professional trader. If you survive the learning curve, then the good times will come and you can become a consistently profitable trader. But you have to survive. And many just can’t.

A common reason for the failure of new day traders is that they cannot manage their early losses. Accepting profits is easy to do, but it is much more difficult, especially for beginners, to overcome the temptation to wait for losing trades to return to the break-even point. “I just give this trade a bit more room” often they say. Waiting for something that is not likely to happen can result in serious damage to their accounts.

To be a successful trader, not only you must learn excellent risk management rules but also you need to firmly implement them.

You must have a line in the sand that tells you when to get out of a trade.

It’s going to be necessary from time to time to admit defeat and say, “I was wrong,” or “The setup isn’t ready yet,” or “I'm getting out of the way.” And that acknowledgement must come in a timely fashion. Waiting too long to exit a trade can literally wipe out your entire account.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but I still lose frequently. That means I must have found a way to be a really good loser. Lose gracefully. Take the losses and walk away.

If a trade goes against you, exit the trade. In day trading, the unexpected will occur, this is the name of the game. There is always another trade and another day. Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting. I.

Holding a position that is trading against you because you are primarily interested in proving your prediction to be correct is bad trading. Your job is not to be correct. Your job is to make money. This career is called trading, not predicting.

I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to be a good loser. You have to be able to accept a loss. It’s an integral part of day trading.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.”.

You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss.

You may very likely find yourself justifying staying in a bad trade by saying, “Well, you know, it's Apple, and they make really great smartphones. They're definitely not going out of business. I'll just hold this a little longer.” You do not want to do that. You must follow the rules of your strategy. You can always get back in, but it’s hard to recover from a big loss. You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss.

Every time you trade, you’re exposing yourself to the risk of losing money. How do you minimize that risk? You need to find a good setup and manage the risk with proper share size and stop loss.

You may think, “I don't want to take a $50 loss.” Well, you definitely don't want to take a subsequent $200 loss. And if you ended up taking an $800 loss, it would be really hard to recover from that. Take the quick losses, get out, and come back when the timing is better.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:.

Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.

A good setup is an opportunity for you to get into a trade with as little risk as possible. That means you might be risking $100, but you have the potential to make $300. You would call that a 3 to 1 profit-to-loss ratio.

Good traders will not take trades with profit-to-loss ratios of less than 2 to 1. That means if you buy $1,000 worth of stock, and are risking $100 on it, you must sell it for at least $1,200 so you will make at least $200. Of course, if the price comes down to $900, you must accept the loss and exit the trade with only $900 (a $100 loss).

Your stop loss should be at a reasonable technical level.

Any stop loss below VWAP is meaningless in this case, because the stock can make a normal pull back toward VWAP at any time and then continue to sell off toward your target.

You are always looking for opportunities to get low-risk entries with big win potential.

As a beginner trader you may not be able to differentiate between a range of setups. It may be difficult for you to recognize what a home-run Bull Flag is and what will end up being a “false breakout”.

You can learn from videos on YouTube and Google. You can also join our chatroom where I explain my trades in real time while I am trading them. You will be able to observe me, my monitor and my trading platform.

Using a 2 to 1 win:lose ratio, I can be wrong 40% of the time and still make money.

Again, your job as a day trader is managing risk, it is not buying and selling stocks. Your broker is buying and selling stocks for you in the market. Your job is to manage your risk and your account. Whenever you click “buy” in your trading platform, you expose your money to a risk.

Chapter 4 focuses on finding the right Stocks in Play for day trading.

You must avoid stocks that (1) are heavily traded by computers and institutional traders, (2) have small relative trading volume, (3) are penny stocks and are therefore highly manipulated, and (4) don’t have any reason to move (no fundamental catalysts).

If you are targeting $1,000 a day, then 10 or 20 shares might not be enough. You either have to take more shares or increase your account size. If you don’t have enough money to trade for a $1,000 daily target, you should lower your daily goal.

I am holding around $25,000 in my trading account and I usually choose 800 shares to trade. My daily goal is $500 or $120,000/year. That is sufficient for my lifestyle. What is your trading goal?.

That’s right. Milk. 2%. You should never risk more than 2% of your account on any given trade.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000.

If you have saved up sufficient funds and have $50,000 in your account, you should never put more than 2% at risk - in this case, $1,000. If you have only been able to save up a modest amount of funds for day trading, then you have no choice but to trade in smaller numbers of shares. Make it one of your unbreakable rules. It will be difficult to move on, but if as you stare at your monitors you see a possible setup that could cost you more than 2% of your trading account, just move on and look for another trade.

With every single trade you make, you should always ensure that at least 98% of your account is protected.

Three-Step Risk Management Step 1: Determine your maximum dollar risk for the trade you’re planning (never more than 2% of your account). Calculate this before your trading day starts. Step 2: Estimate your maximum risk per share, the strategy stop loss, in dollars, from your entry. This comes from the strategies set out in Chapter 7, where I explain in each strategy what the stop loss should be. Step 3: Divide “1” by “2” to find the absolute maximum number of shares you are allowed to trade each time. To better illustrate this, let’s return to the example of MOH from a few pages back. If you have a $40,000 account, the 2% rule will limit your risk on any trade to $800. Let’s assume you want to be conservative and risk only 1% of that account, or $400. That will be Step 1. As you monitor MOH, you see a situation develop where the VWAP Strategy (see Chapter 7) may very well work in your favor. You decide to sell short the stock at $50, and you want to cover them at $48.80, with a stop loss at $50.40. You will be risking $0.40 per share. That will be Step 2 of risk control. For Step 3, calculate your share size by dividing “Step 1” by “Step 2” to find the maximum size you may trade. In this example, you will be allowed to buy a maximum of 1,000 shares.

In this case, you may not have enough cash or buying power to buy 1,000 shares of MOH at $50 (because you have only $40,000 in your account). So instead you will buy 800 shares or, perhaps, even 500 shares. Remember, you can always risk less, but you are not allowed to risk more than 2% of your account under any circumstance.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If.

For example, when your stop would be above of a moving average (see Chapter 5 for my indicators on my chart), you need to calculate and see if that stop would be bigger than your maximum account size or not. If break of moving average will yield a $600 loss, and you have set a $400 maximum loss per trade, then you should either take fewer shares in that trade or not take that trade at all and wait for another opportunity.

I understand that calculating your stop loss and maximum loss in your account size in a live trade is difficult. Remember Rule 2? Day trading is not supposed to be easy. Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account.

I understand that calculating your stop loss and maximum loss in your account size in a live trade is difficult. Remember Rule 2? Day trading is not supposed to be easy. Trading needs practice and I strongly recommend that new traders paper trade under supervision for at least three months in a live simulated account. It sounds crazy at the beginning, but you will quickly learn how to manage your account and your risk per trade. You will be amazed at how rapidly the human brain can do calculations on what share size to take and where to set the stop loss.

One trader might become discouraged, curse the market, and give up for the day. Another trader might become frustrated,.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally.

A key reason why many traders fail is that they take negative events and losses in trading personally. Their confidence and peace of mind are connected to their trading results. When traders do well, they feel good. When they encounter losses, they become discouraged, doubtful, and frustrated, questioning themselves, their strategy and their career. Instead of dealing directly and constructively with their losses, they react to the emotions triggered by personalizing the events.

Successful traders are those who trade for skill and not for the money.

Every morning, you should scan the market, find the opportunities, and sometimes in a matter of seconds make decisions on whether you should buy or sell or sell short the Stock in Play, and you need to make that call with a high degree of discipline.

One of the key contributors to traders’ self-discipline is their physical and mental health. People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders.

People who eat well-balanced nutritional meals, exercise regularly, maintain proper body weight and fitness levels, and get adequate rest are likely to have the levels of energy and alertness that are required to make them effective traders. You may be surprised to read this, but your state of alertness, your energy level, and your overall health have a significant impact on your daily trading results. Those who neglect these aspects of their well-being or, even worse, abuse alcohol or drugs, will find it difficult to concentrate and make good decisions.

Fatigue, physical tension, and ill health will often affect your concentration and adversely affect your sound decision making process.

It is difficult to make and sustain the required mental efforts for day trading when you lack proper sleep or feel down from a lack of exercise. Very often, your moods are influenced by your physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much you eat. Keep a daily record of both your trading results and your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping your body, and thus your mind, in their peak operating condition.

Aspects of personal lives outside of trading can also affect effectiveness as a trader. Changes in personal relationships such as breakup or divorce, family issues like illness, and financial problems can reduce a person’s ability to focus and make appropriate decisions.

It certainly took time, but I found that the more and more I practiced, the more effectively I was able to execute my trading strategies (that I will explain later).

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade.

Your success will be very limited, and any success will almost exclusively be based on pure luck, if you yourself do not know in advance what you will do before you enter a trade. You need to have a well-thought-out plan and you need to follow that plan.

This is what many traders find difficult. All of these decisions, the very process of ensuring these decisions fit into your risk tolerance and your strategy parameters, are a tough multitasking call.

I understand that stress. There have been times when I've been in the trade, had an $80,000 position, and all I needed to do was to sell. But as I was looking at my keyboard, I found myself frozen like the proverbial deer in the headlights. I couldn’t even figure out which keys to punch. This sort of paralysis is not unusual when you’re overwhelmed. It happens to every single one of us. But remember, confidence in trading doesn’t arise from being right and profitable in all of your trades, it comes from surviving the occasions of being wrong and losing money.

Trading is stressful. Active day trading is perhaps the most stressful of all trading periods. One mistake can ruin your month. One missed proper profit taking can ruin your week. There is a fine line between being a good trader and being a losing trader. If you are under pressure, don’t make any trades. Take a walk to release your stress and do not restart trading until you are once again focused and calm. Often trading professionals will refresh their minds by going for a run after a bad loss, and then come back to restart trading, but in a simulator and not live, until they are back on track emotionally.

You must take the time to prepare, you must work hard, you must plan your trades, you must take the time afterwards to review your trades, and you cannot do it alone. You cannot succeed on your own. There is so much value in sharing ideas and learning from a community of traders and, should you have one, your mentor.

Are you trading profitably? Have you had five wins in a row or have you had five losses in a row? If you are on a losing streak, will you be in touch with your own emotions and maintain your composure, or will you let your judgment be impaired?.

Once you’ve learned it, the skill of identifying a good stock to trade will not go away.

But it's important to remember that if you start to get over-confident and think you’ve outsmarted the market on trading wisdom, or that you don’t need to learn any more, you’ll often get a quick reminder from that market. You’ll lose money and you will see that the market is correcting you.

I will reiterate: being able to make quick decisions and being able to make and then follow your trading rules are critical for success in the market. As you continue through this book, you are going to read much about risk management. Everything that traders do comes back to risk management because ultimately it is the most important concept for a trader to understand.

Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. You cannot be a successful day trader without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.

But never forget the previously explained 2% rule. Do not take a trade if more than 2% of your account will be put in jeopardy. It very simply is not worth the risk.

There’s a very simple truth that you must accept: you should not expect to be right all of the time. It’s impossible to be. Trading is based on probabilities, and it requires a great deal of patience to identify setups with attractive risk/reward potential. I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day.

There’s a very simple truth that you must accept: you should not expect to be right all of the time. It’s impossible to be.

I’m a consistently profitable trader, but 30% of my trades result in a loss. I don’t expect to be right every single trade. If you owned a small business, you wouldn’t expect it to be profitable every single day. There would be days when you wouldn’t have enough customers or sales even to support your staff or your lease, but these would be more than offset by days when your business prospered.

If you examine the work of most successful traders, they all take many small losses. Their results are littered with numerous small losses of 7c (cents), 5c, 3c, and even 1c per share. Most good day traders have few losses that are more than 30c per share. Most winning trades should work for you right away.

One of the fundamentals you must learn from this book is that every day trading strategy comes with a stop loss level and you must stop out from stocks that trade against your strategy.

Imagine for a moment that you are shorting a stock below an important resistance level and you are waiting for the price to go lower. That is fine. But suddenly the price turns against you and breaks the resistance level and trades higher. Now your original trade plan is obsolete. You have no reason to stay in the trade. You cannot wait in the trade in the hope that the stock may trade lower again. That is wishful thinking. You can wipe out your trading account with ONE crazy move. The stock may or may not trade lower again, but above the resistance level you have no reason to be short in the stock. If the stock was weak and comes back below the level, you may enter the trade again. Commissions are cheap, so accept a small loss and get out. You can always get back into the trade when the setup is ready.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator.

This is a common problem amongst new traders: they don’t accept the small loss. You must work at this while trading in a simulator. You should move to live trading only if you have mastered accepting and respecting your stop loss. If you don’t know where your stop loss is or where it should be, it means than perhaps you should not be in that trade in the first place. It means you have not planned it correctly. It also means you should step back to reading about and reviewing your strategies and return to again trade in the simulator.

Consistently profitable traders just make sound and reasonable trades. They accept that they cannot control the market or results on every single trade, but they stick to their plan and control their capital. Often you can review your profit and loss at the end of the month. Professional traders often review their P&L quarterly, and then make a decision on their performance and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules.

Many traders think a good trading day is a positive day. Wrong. A good trading day is a day that you were disciplined, traded sound strategies and did not violate any trading rules. The normal uncertainty of the stock market will result in some of your days being negative, but that does not mean that a negative day was a bad trading day.

“You are only as good as the stocks that you trade.”.

You can be the best trader in the world, but if your stocks do not move, nor have enough volume, then you cannot make money consistently.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted. As a day trader, you must be efficient with your time and buying power (which will be explained in Chapter.

Now, we don’t want stocks to just move, but we seek stocks where we can identify that they are about to move in a certain direction. It is possible that a stock that moves $5 intraday may never offer us excellent risk/reward opportunities. Some stocks move too much intraday without foreshadowing their direction.

I certainly experienced this as a new trader. If you learn the strategies explained in Chapter 7, but you cannot make money consistently, it is possible that you are in the wrong stock.

Again, you are only as good as the stocks you trade.

There is more than one way to select Stocks in Play and make money trading them, and there is definitely more than one correct way.

Some day traders like my friend Trader Brian trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) exclusively.

Many have developed proprietary filters to find stocks. Others concentrate on trading the markets as a whole with index Futures.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5c and your upside is 25c, or your downside is 20c and your upside is $1 – that’s 1:5.

Trading the right Stocks in Play help you to combat algorithmic programs.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels which we can trade off from.

You must remember that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume.

Do not trade AAPL unless it has a very unusual trading volume. If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

Interestingly enough, when you take a close look at the chart, you realize that on those days the stock gapped up or down.

The other days were comprised of just normal, high frequency, algorithmic trading. Retail traders should stay away from stocks that are trading normally.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing.

How do you recognize the behavior of the market? Index funds such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500 (SPY) are usually good indicators of what the overall market is doing. If the Dow.

If the Dow Jones or the SPY are red, it means that the overall market is weak. If the Dow Jones or the SPY are strong, then the overall market will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume is independent of the overall market; they are Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are.

In day trading, Alpha stocks are the ones that are independent of both the overall market and their sector.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares.

We know we need high relative volume, but how much volume is enough. I don’t trade stocks with an average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares. You need certain liquidity in the stock to be able to get in and out of the stock without difficulty.

What makes a stock a Stock in Play? Usually it is the release of fundamental news about the stock either the day before or during the same trading day.

I check the news on all stocks up or down more than 2% pre-market and shortlist my Gappers watchlist (which I will explain further along in this book). Stocks in Play the day before are often still in play for a few days after.

In Chapter 7, I explain specific day trading strategies such as Momentum, Reversal, VWAP, and Moving Average. For the moment, your main question needs to be, how do I find the stock for each strategy? I categorize stocks for retail trading into three classes. Based on my experiences, this categorization provides some clarity on how to find stocks and on how to adopt a strategy for them.

Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

Low float stocks can be volatile and move very fast. Most of the low float stocks are under $10 because they are early stage companies which for the most part are not profitable.

These low float stocks are also called “ small cap ” or “ micro-cap ” stocks. Day traders love low float stocks. Now let’s return to those three categories.

Low float stocks under $10 are often highly manipulated and difficult to trade, and therefore only very experienced and highly equipped retail traders should trade these stocks.

The first category consists of low float stocks that are priced under $10.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock.

If someone claims to have turned $1,000 into $10,000 in a month, and if it’s true, they must have traded this type of low float stock. No beginner or even intermediate trader can trade with such accuracy and efficiency.

When it comes to low float stocks, the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy — which I detail in Chapter 7 —works best. The other strategies in this book are not suitable for low float sub-$10 stocks.

Trading low float stocks is very difficult for the new trader. It is difficult to read the direction of their next move and therefore they are very difficult to manage your risk while trading them. I discourage new traders from trading low float stocks. When the new trader is wrong, the loss is such that it wipes out many gains.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares.

The second category is medium float stocks in the range of $10-$100. These stocks have medium floats of around 10 million to 500 million shares. Many of my strategies explained in this book work well on these stocks, especially the VWAP and Support or Resistance Strategies. Medium float stocks that are more expensive than $100 are not popular among retail day traders and I myself avoid them. You usually cannot buy many shares of them because of their high price. Therefore, it is basically useless to day trade them. Leave them for the institutional traders.

The third category of stocks for trading is m ega cap stocks like Apple, Alibaba, Yahoo, Microsoft and Home Depot. These are well established companies that usually have over $500 million in public shares available for trading. These stocks are traded in millions of shares every day. As you may guess, these stocks move only when large institutional traders, investment banks, and hedge funds are buying or selling large positions. Retail traders like us, who typically trade 100 to 1,000 shares, usually cannot move the price of these stocks. Retail traders should avoid these stocks unless there is a good fundamental catalyst for them.

From the strategies set forth in Chapter 7, Reversals and Moving Average Strategies usually work well on these stocks.

Do not forget though, unless there is a fundamental catalyst, these stocks are being heavily traded by computers and high frequency traders and are not suitable for retail day trading.

Low float (less than 10 million) Under $10 Only Momentum (Long) Medium float (10-500 million) $10-$100 All, mostly VWAP and Support or Resistance Large float (+500 million) Any (usually +$20) All, mostly Moving Average and Reversal.

Stocks in Play can be found in two ways: Pre-market morning watchlist Real time intraday scans.

Experienced traders are sensitive to being in the right stocks at the right time. As I mentioned, traders are just as good as the stocks they trade. I and the traders in my community use a scanner every morning that I program to find Stocks in Play based on the following criteria:.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2%.

Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market.

Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

Stocks that have Average True Range of at least 50 cents (how large of a range a stock has on average every day).

There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

As a rule, I do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out).

I look for highly traded stocks, so that buying and selling 1,000 shares won’t be a problem. That is why I am looking at stocks with an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.

When there are some fundamental catalysts, there will be unusual pre-market activity and a Stock in Play will have gapped up or down before the market opens with a significant number of shares being traded (such as 50,000 shares).

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily.

I also am looking for stocks that usually move in a good range for trading. That is why I look at Average True Range (ATR). ATR means how large of a range a stock has on average every day. If ATR is $1, then you can expect the stock to move around $1 daily. That is a good number.

If you have 1,000 shares, you may profit $1,000 from the trade. But if ATR is only 10 cents, then that trading range is not attractive for me.

As you can see, I have highlighted the Gap (%) and Float columns on my watchlist.

From over 4,000 stocks, I now have only eight candidates. I will go over each of them before the market opens at 9:30 a.m. I will check the news on each of them to learn why they gapped up or down. Is there a fundamental catalyst for that stock? Has there been any news coverage or extreme events for that company?.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups.

From those eight, I usually select two or three stocks to watch closely. You cannot watch eight stocks, and regardless, there are usually no more than two or three good candidates. I watch the best two or three candidates closely on my screen, looking for potential setups. I plan my trades before the market opens (I provide some thoughts on how to create if-then statements in Chapter 9) and then I wait for the market bell. I then trade my plan.

A high short interest indicates traders or investors think a stock’s price is likely to fall. But the challenge with high short interest is that these stocks are more prone to a short squeeze by bullish investors and traders. A short squeeze occurs when short sellers panic and are scrambling to return their borrowed shares, forcing prices to increase quickly and dangerously. You do not want to be stuck short in a short squeeze.

Figure 4.3 below is a screenshot of a scanner on my Trade Ideas software (see Chapter 5) that is set to find real time stocks for me that:.

Have gapped up or down at least $1.

Have ATR of more than 50 cents.

Have average relative volume of at least 1.5 (the stock is trading at 1.5 times its normal volume).

Have average daily trading volume of at least 500,000 shares.

Having ATR of more than 50 cents is important because you want the stock to move enough during the day so you can make a profit out of its volatility.

There is no point in trading a stock that is moving only 5 cents on average in a day.

I will also take a look at the sector of stocks. If I have a few stocks in one sector, there is a good chance that these stocks are not in play. They have high relative volume because their sector is under heavy trading by institutional traders. It is important to know that stocks usually trade with their sector.

Remember, you are only as good as the stock you trade, so if you are the best trader in the world, but in a wrong stock, you will lose money.

If you join a community of day traders such as mine, you will be able to see my scanner in real time. These scanners are costly, around $100 per month, so at the beginning of your career transition to day trading, you will probably want to keep your expenses down as much as possible.

Sometimes you have to plan a trade in a few minutes and at other times in just a few seconds. This is why you need months of training in simulator accounts to well understand the decision making process.

This strategy involves taking only the best setups and waiting on the sidelines until I see something worth trading.

Day trading can be a boring profession – most of the time you are just sitting and watching your list. In fact, if day trading is not boring for you, then you are probably overtrading.

Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) enforce laws that limit the number of trades a trader can make if they are undercapitalized. The rules adopt the term "pattern day trader", which includes any person that day trades (buys and then sells or sells short and then buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five business days. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that they day trade. The required minimum equity must be in their account prior to any day trading activities. If the account falls below the $25,000 requirement, the pattern day trader will not be permitted to day trade again until their account is restored to the $25,000 minimum equity level.

Although many new traders who do not have more than $25,000 in their account do not appreciate this rule, and see it as a barrier, it actually is in place to protect amateur traders from losing their limited capital to the high fees and commissions of brokers.

Direct-access brokers are the answer to this question. These firms concentrate on speed and order execution - unlike a full-service broker that focuses on research and advice to investors.

As mentioned above, the PDT rule applies, meaning CenterPoint Securities requires at least $25,000 (for U.S. residents only) to open an account.

They are offering members of our community a flat commission rate of $2.95/trade, regardless of share size in your trade. This is an astoundingly low fee, compared to the typical $4.95/trade charge of many other brokers.

When a broker notices that you are using leverage and losing money, they might issue a “ margin call ” to you. A margin call is a serious warning and day traders must avoid getting them. It means that your loss is now equal to the original money you had in your account. You must add more money or else your broker will freeze your account. If you need to know more about margin, leverage or margin calls, check the broker’s website, do some research on the Internet, email me, or ask other traders in your chatroom.

If your broker doesn't use a platform or software that has Hotkeys, you're not going to get in and out of trades fast enough.

Swing traders enter and exit trades within days or weeks, therefore end-of-day data that is available on the Internet for free is sufficient for them.

A bid is always lower, an ask is always higher, and the difference is called the bid-ask spreads.

The most important information you must take away from Level 2 is the bid-ask spreads. Spreads are higher in lower volume traded stocks, as the market makers who dominate such stocks demand higher fees from those who want to join their party.

The bid-ask spreads are likely to be small, perhaps only one cent on a quiet day in an actively traded stock. They grow wider as prices accelerate on the way up or down and may become huge—I have seen up to $2—after a severe drop or a very sharp rally.

Here is what I have on my charts: Price action in the form of candlesticks Volume of shares being traded 9 Exponential Moving Average (9 EMA) 20 Exponential Moving Average (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average (50 SMA) 200 Simple Moving Average (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price.

I don’t trade without knowing nearby significant intraday levels of support or resistance.

I keep the color of all my moving average indicators in grey except VWAP which is colored in blue. VWAP is the most important day trading indicator and needs to be easily and quickly distinguished from other moving averages.

I don’t want to have a lot of colors on my charts so I maintain a white background with mostly red and black coloring. Heavily colored charts are confusing and over the long term irritate your eyes and limit your vision.

If you place a market order, it will be filled at the current price, whatever that happens to be. A limit order, on the other hand, allows you to specify the maximum or minimum price you will accept.

In market orders, essentially, you are getting filled at the bad side of bid-ask spreads. A market order buys at the ask (high side) and sells at the bid (low side).

The problem with using market orders is that the market can quickly change, and so then does the bid-ask spread, and thus you may get your order filled at a very bad price. For example, if the bid-ask spread is $10.95-$10.97, market orders should buy immediately at $10.97 for you, right? When your market orders come to the Exchange, the market can quickly change to $11.10-$11.15, and therefore your buy market order will be filled at $11.15. That is a 15 cents slippage. And that is really bad.

Market makers and many professional traders make a good living from filling market orders. I discourage traders from placing market orders at any time. A market order is like a blank check. Most of the time a market order will be filled very closely to the quoted bid or ask price, but sometimes you will get a nasty surprise.

Use limit orders whenever possible.

Swing traders commonly use limit orders.

“Buy me now, but up to this price! Not higher!” “Sell me now, but down to this price! Not lower!”.

I use marketable limit orders for all of my day trades. I typically buy at the “ask+5 cents” and sell at the “bid-5 cents”. In the next section, I will show you details of my order Hotkeys.

In my opinion, it is almost impossible to day trade profitably without using Hotkeys.

You may have noticed in Figure 5.4 that I have different Hotkeys for when a stock is in Short Selling Restriction (SSR) mode. An SSR is triggered when a stock is down 10% or more from the previous day's close. In that case, regulators and the Exchanges restrict short selling of the stock when its price is dropping. You can only sell short on the ask, you cannot sell short directly to the buyers (on the bid). It means that the priority for selling is for the sellers who currently hold positions, not for the short sellers who are wanting to profit from the downward movement. If you want to sell short, you have to queue up on the ask side and wait for buyers to come to you. Real sellers, on the other hand, can accept bids from buyers and get rid of their positions.

Part of your education includes trading in simulators for a few months, and during these months, you must master your Hotkeys.

Another important reminder is to always use a wired keyboard that is plugged into your computer. Wireless keyboards can send repeat keystrokes, errant keystrokes, or can fail to send orders at all, especially when low in battery power.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using.

I even keep one extra keyboard in my office, ready to go, just in case something happens to the keyboard I’m using. One time I spilled water on my keyboard while trading. My keyboard stopped working. Fortunately, I did not have any open position at that moment.

One of the common challenges that new traders mention is not knowing what to trade.

Two long-standing trading rooms are Linda Bradford Raschke’s trading room, which emphasizes technical trading across multiple markets.

Two long-standing trading rooms are Linda Bradford Raschke’s trading room, which emphasizes technical trading across multiple markets ( www.lbrgroup.com ), and the trading room run by author John Carter and Hubert Senters ( www.tradethemarkets.com ). You should also take a look at the educational programs run by Jim Dalton and Terry Liberman ( www.marketsinprofile.com ) as another possible place for connecting with like-minded traders.

Well-known trading forums are Elite Trader ( www.elitetrader.com ) and Trade2Win ( www.trade2win.com ). Indeed, if you have a favorite trading platform or application, connecting with traders who are using the same tools can be quite valuable. Market Delta ( www.marketdelta.com ) and Trade Ideas ( www.trade-ideas.com ) run educational programs and online chatrooms for their users that I’ve found useful.

Never forget that successful traders are independent thinkers.

The Japanese began using technical analysis and some early versions of candlesticks to trade rice in the 17 th century.

Rule 9: Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.

At every moment in the market there are basically three categories of traders: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided traders. The actual prices of transactions are the result of the actions of all of these traders at a particular point in time: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided.

In day trading, the difference between the two is called the bid-ask spread (Chapter 5).

Buyers are buying because they expect that prices will go up. Buying by bulls pushes the market up, or as I like to phrase it, “Buyers are in control.” The result is that buyers are willing to pay higher and higher prices and to bid on top of each other. They are apprehensive that they will end up paying higher prices if they don’t buy now. Undecided traders accelerate price increases by creating a feeling of urgency among the buyers, who then buy quickly and cause prices to go higher.

The goal of a successful day trader is to figure out if the sellers will end up in control or if the buyers will end up in control, and then make a calculated move, at the appropriate time, quickly and stealthily.

Your job is to analyze the balance of the power between buyers and sellers and bet on the winning group. Fortunately, candlestick charts reflect this fight and mass psychology in action. A successful day trader is a social psychologist behind a computer and charting software. Day trading is the study of mass psychology.

Candles are always born neutral. After birth, they can grow to become either bearish, bullish or, on rare occasions, neither. When a candle is born, traders do not know what it will become. They may speculate but they do not truly know what a candle is until it dies (closes). After a candle is born, the battle begins. The bulls and the bears fight it out, and the candle displays who is winning. If buyers are in control, you will see the candle move up and form a bullish candle. If sellers are in control of the price, you will see the candle move down and become a bearish candle. You may be thinking that this is all very obvious, but many traders don’t see candles as a fight between buyers and sellers. That little candle is an excellent indicator that tells you who is currently winning the battle, the bulls (buyers) or the bears (sellers).

Just by learning to read candlesticks, you will begin to generate an opinion on the general attitude for a stock. Again, this is called the “ price action.

Understanding who is in control of the price is an extremely important skill in day trading.

Day trading truly is the study of mass psychology during the day.

Back in Chapter 2 I used the example of a sandbox in a schoolyard. You don’t want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. If you are, you’re in the wrong place. If the buyers are strong, you want to be buying and holding. If the sellers are strong, you want to be selling and selling short. You definitely do not want to be off in the sandbox doing your own thing. You want to be where the action is. And if you can’t decide what that action is, if it looks like it’s a toss-up, don’t do anything.

Similarly, if a Doji forms in a bearish downward trend, it suggests that the bears have become exhausted and the bulls (buyers) are fighting back to take control of the price.

Always remember that these candles only indicate indecision and not a definite reversal.

As a day trader, you shouldn’t care about companies and their earnings. Day traders are not concerned about what companies do or what they make. Your attention should only be on price action, technical indicators and chart patterns. I know more stock symbols than the names of actual companies.

I don't mingle fundamental analysis with technical analysis while making a trade; I focus exclusively on the technical indicators.

I’ve come to recognize in my trading career that the best setups are the nine strategies that I will be explaining in this chapter.

These are simple strategies in theory, but they are difficult to master and require plenty of practice.

Another point to remember is that in the market right now, over 60% of the volume is algorithmic high frequency trading. That means you are trading against computers.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute.

My preference is 5-minute charts, but I will also simultaneously monitor 1-minute charts.

And please, remember, my philosophy of trading is that you must master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method will work to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is what separates the winners from the losers.

Two traders enter into a trade based on one strategy. The positions go their way and then pull back a bit. The first trader fears losing his gain and takes a quick, small profit. The second trader adds to the position on the pull back and books a large gain. Same idea, different outcomes, all as the result of two different mindsets and trade management styles.

Day trading is a business. Like any other business, success is not just about products and services but much of it will be the result of an excellent management of the business. For example, if you don’t hire the right people for your business, or supervise them properly, or track your inventory, you’ll fail to make money with even the best products and services.

Rather, trade management is referring to what you do with the position after you’ve entered it and before you’ve exited it.

Novice traders believe that when they enter the trade, they should not do anything else but patiently wait for the price to hit their profit target or stop loss level. This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea.

This is the opposite of what professional traders do. The professionals know this is not sufficient. When you plan for the trade and enter a position, you have a minimum of information regarding the market and the validity of your idea. As the market moves after your entry, you will receive new price action and data about your initial trade idea: the price action of the stock is either supporting or not supporting your reasons for being in that trade. Therefore, you need to manage your open position.

For example, if you are expecting a break from a strong support level to the downside, and you want to profit the move to the downside with a short position, you may want to start with shorting 100 shares. Momentum scalper traders will usually start scalping when the level breaks to the downside. When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level.

When those scalpers take their profit, the price often pulls back to that support level to test it as a new resistance level. If it is held below the support level (now acting as a resistance level), you can start adding to your short position on the way down. If it does not act as a resistance level and the price moves back up, you will get stopped out for a small loss because you only had 100 shares.

I’ll discuss scalping and scalpers further in the section that follows on the Bull Flag Momentum Strategy.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick.

It always intrigues me in our chatroom when two experienced traders select the same stock: one long and the other short. Often, by the end of the day, both are profitable, proving that experience in trade and risk management and proper position sizing are more important than the stock and the direction that traders pick. Often my friend Brian Pez and I will trade against each other, but we will both be profitable when we finish our day. And how does that happen? It’s based on practice, discipline and controlling our emotions in the heat of the trade, even though I do like to think that I’m a better trader than him!.

In other trades, you just want to go for a “taste” and perhaps add more later. Learning when to have the most size is a skill that new traders must acquire.

No matter how good of an opportunity, you may not risk more than 2% of your account in one trade. Live to trade another day.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size.

You can make a lot of money trading in and out of an active stock with small size. Likewise, you can lose a great deal of money trading in and out of an active stock with too big of a size.

For example, for low float stocks that can move 10% or 20% in a matter of seconds, I never take a large position, even though their price is typically low (in the range of $1-$10) and I have sufficient buying power for a very large position.

My trade size depends on the price of the stock and on my account size and risk management rule (Chapter 3), but 800 shares is my usual size if I am trading in the $10-$50 price range.

If the trade goes in my favor, I add another 400 shares (note that I add into my winning position, not into a losing one).

I sell 400 shares in the first target, bringing my stop loss to break-even (my entry point).

I always retain some shares in case the prices keep moving in my favor.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100.

I rarely trade stocks higher than $100. The more expensive stocks are less attractive to retail traders and are often dominated by computers and institutional traders.

Their initial share size might be relatively small, but traders will add to their position as the price action validates their idea.

For example, for a 1,000-share trade, they enter either 500/500 or 100/200/700 shares. If done correctly, this is an excellent method of risk and trade management.

I rarely scale down into a losing trade. I always scale up ; I add to my winning position.

Averaging down losing positions is perhaps the most common mistake a beginner will make and that will almost certainly lead to the end of their short trading career.

Remember, averaging down does not work for day traders. I have tried it. 85% of the time you will profit when you average down. But the 15% of the time you are wrong, you will blow up your account.

Remember, it only takes ONE bad trade to blow up your account and for you to be done with your day trading career forever.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished.

When something is selling off, you really do not know if it will be a massive bear market until you see the charts. And, sadly, you cannot see the charts until it is too late, not until after the sell off is finished. I thought the sell off must be a normal pull back. During that time, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3x Shares (ticker: LABU) started to sell off too, and its share price dropped from $148 to below $60. I purchased 100 shares at $120 with the hope that it would go back to $148. It did not. It went below $100. I added an additional 100 shares. My average was now $110. It plunged further to $80. I added 200 more. My average became $90. It went further to $60. I added 400 shares more (and I was almost out of money). My average became $70 and I held a huge 800 share position on LABU. It dropped further to $58. I was just long, and I was so very wrong. I got a margin call from my broker. I could not add further money because I did not have any. My broker froze my account and sold my position. I had the most devastating loss in my trading career. Two days later LABU rebounded to over $100.

I said to myself, if I only had a bigger account….

I don’t know why, but traders such as Brian Hunter will at times stubbornly put being right about their decision over making money. These are the types of traders who conveniently forget that the market can remain irrational longer than they can survive in the game. You cannot let your pride get the best of you. If you’ve made a bad decision, take a loss and get out early. Predictions and speculations have their place, but the price action of the stock is the most important indicator for traders like us. If you believe in an irrefutable trading opinion and the price action does not confirm your bias, then simply do not make the trade.

You want to enter the trade, but you should not chase the trade, because at point B it is very extended and already at a high price. In addition, you cannot say where your stop loss should be. You must never enter a trade without knowing where your stop is.

When they announced that they had a new $50 million contract to build a new ship (There’s a fundamental catalyst! Remember Chapter 2?).

Knew that when the price went higher, closer.

I knew that when the price went higher, closer to B, buyers would jump on massively.

Close to point D, the volume suddenly spiked, which meant that many more traders were jumping into the trade.

My profit target was when the stock made a new low on a 5-minute chart, which was a sign of weakness.

When I observe with my scanner or I’m advised by someone in our chatroom that a stock is surging up from point A and reaching a significant new high for the day (point B), I wait to see if the price makes a support higher than point A. I call this point C. I do not jump into the trade right away.

I watch the stock during its consolidation period (I’ll explain this term in the next strategy). I choose my share size and stop and exit strategy.

When I see that the price is holding support at level C, I enter the trade close to the price of point C in anticipation of moving forward to point D or higher.

My stop is the loss of point C. If the price goes lower than point C, I sell and accept the loss. Therefore, it is important to buy the stock close to point C to minimize the loss. Some traders wait and buy only at point D to ensure that the ABCD Pattern is really working. In my opinion, that approach basically reduces your reward while at the same time increasing your risk.

If the price moves higher, I sell half of my position at point D, and bring my stop higher to my entry point (break-even).

I sell the remaining position as soon as my target hits or I sense that the price is losing steam or that the sellers are acquiring control of the price action. When the price makes a new low on my 5-minute chart, it is a good indicator that the buyers are almost exhausted.

Consolidation means that the traders who bought stocks at a lower price are now selling and taking their profits. Although that is happening, the price does not decrease sharply because the buyers are still entering into trades and the sellers are not yet in control of the price. Many traders who missed buying the stock before the Bull Flag started, will now be looking for an opportunity to take a trade.

Wise traders know that it is risky to buy a stock when the price is increasing significantly. That’s called “ chasing the stock ”. Professional traders aim to enter the trade during quiet times and take their profits during the volatile times.

They jump in or out when stocks begin to run, but grow bored and lose interest when the prices are, shall I say, sleepy.

Chasing the stocks is an account killer for beginners. You must wait until the stock finds its high point, and then you must wait for the consolidation. As soon as the price start breaking up in the consolidation area, you can begin purchasing stocks. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, patience truly is a virtue.

Third and higher consolidation periods are risky because the price has probably been very extended in a way that indicates that the buyers will soon be losing their control.

I don’t trade more than two Bull Flags in a stock and, as you can see in this chart, the stock started to sell off after the third Bull Flag (at around $7). Aside from the strategy, did you notice that OPTT moved from $1.50 to almost $7 in just 35 minutes? This kind of move can be expected from low float under $10 stocks.

Get in, scalp, and get out quickly. That’s the philosophy of momentum scalpers:.

The Bull Flag is a long-based strategy. You should not short a Bull Flag.

I personally don’t trade much momentum. It is a risky strategy and beginners should be very careful trading these. If you choose to, trade only in a small size and only after sufficient practice in simulators. You will also need a super-fast execution system for scalping.

If you are part of our chatroom, you will hear me say time and time again that what goes up, must come down. Don’t chase the trade if it is too extended . The inverse is also true. What goes down will definitely come back up to some extent.

An RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest. The RSI, developed initially by famous technical analyst Welles Wilder, Jr., is an indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses in price over a period of time to measure the speed and change of price movement. The RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traders in Reversal Strategies use RSI values to identify overbought or oversold conditions and to find buy or sell signals. For example, RSI readings above 90 indicate overbought conditions and RSI readings below 10 indicate oversold conditions. If you.

You must simultaneously look for a certain RSI level and a certain number of consecutive candles.

What you definitely don’t want is to be on the wrong side of a reversal trade, or, as we call it, “ catching a falling knife ”. It doesn’t sound like a good idea in real life and it's not a good idea in trading. It means that when a stock is selling off badly (the falling knife), you don’t want to buy on the assumption that it should bounce. If the stocks are dropping, you want to wait for the confirmation of the reversal.

This will usually be (1) the formation of a Doji or indecision candle and (2) the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high near an important intraday support level. That is my entry point. I set my stop at the low of the previous candlestick or at the loss of the support level.

Institutional traders and hedge funds have started selling their large position to the public market and the stock price is tanking.

Traders have started short selling a stock because of some bad fundamental news, but they will have to cover their shorts sooner or later. That is where you wait for an entry. When short sellers are trying to cover their shorts, the stock will reverse quickly, that is called a “short squeeze”. You want to ride that.

But please, remember the mantra: what goes up, must come down.

Each Reversal Strategy has four important elements: At least five candlesticks on a 5-minute chart moving upward or downward.

The stock is being traded at or near an important intraday support or resistance level.

I only take reversal trades when the price is near a significant support level (for Bottom Reversal) or a significant resistance level (for Top Reversal).

When the trend is coming to an end, usually indecision candles, such as a spinning top or Doji, form. That is when you need to be ready.

A Doji is a candle that has a wick longer than its body.

This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

The same is true about a bullish Doji. You can also see a picture of a bullish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long lower wick that some would call a bottom tail and others would call a hammer. When you have a hammer candle with a bottom tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved down, was unable to hold at those low levels, and was bought up. This indicates a battle between the buyers and the sellers in which the sellers lost their push down. It is a good indication that the buyers may now gain control of the price and push that price up.

You can see a picture of a bearish Doji in Figure 7.9 below. It has that long upper wick that some would call a top tail and that others would call a shooting star. This candle tells you four things: the open price, the close price, the high of that period and the low of that period. So, when you have a candle with a top tail, you know that at some point during that candle period the price moved up, was unable to hold at that level, and was then sold off. It depicts a bit of a battle taking place between the buyers and the sellers in which the buyers lost their push up. It is a good indication that the sellers may soon control the price and will push that price down.

In reversal trading, it is best that the RSI be at the extremes (above 90, below 10). Once you find that, you must then look for an actual entry near a strong intraday support (for Bottom Reversal) or resistance level (for Top Reversal).

As mentioned, an entry for me is going to be either the first 1-minute or the first 5-minute candle to reach a new high (for Bottom Reversal) or to make a new low (for Top Reversal) and only when the price is being traded near an important intraday support or resistance level.

In a Bottom Reversal, when you’ve had a long run of consecutive candles making new lows, the first candle that makes the new high near an important support level is very significant.

The 5-minute chart is cleaner. The first 5-minute candle to make a new high near an intraday support level is the point at which I enter the reversal, with a stop at the low of the day.

Once you’re in one of these trades, your exit indicators are quite simple. I take profit when the price reaches a moving average (either 9 EMA, 20 EMA or VWAP) or reaches another important intraday level.

In a Bottom Reversal, if the stock pops up and then suddenly moves back down, I stop out for a loss. If I jump in long, buying stock and hoping the price will go higher, and instead the price ends up just going sideways, it’s a sign that I am probably going to see a consolidation for another move down, and that is an indication that the price is probably going to continue to drop. If I get in and I hold for a few minutes and the price stays flat, I get out, no matter what happens after that. I may be wrong, but I don’t like to expose my account to the unknown.

I need to be in the right setup, and if it is not ready yet, I’m out. If I get into the profit zone, I can start adjusting my stop, first to break-even, and then to the low of the last 5-minute candle. I will then keep adjusting my stop as I move up.

An indecision candlestick at the bottom of the downtrend signifies a potential reversal, and, as you can see, right after that is a big swing back up.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves.

The most significant advantage to Reversal Strategies is that they overcome the difficulty of anticipating when stocks will make major moves. You will probably miss the moment when the stock starts to sell off, and you won’t have time to sell short the stock for profit, but you can always prepare for the reversal trade.

My scanner, at 10:57 a.m., showed me that ALR had seven consecutive candles to the downside, a relatively low float (80 million shares) and a relative volume of 1.21, which meant it was trading higher than usual.

At times, a reversal happens so fast that indecision candlesticks will not form. Therefore, it is important to observe the price action near significant intraday levels, and to of course confirm the reversal with an indication of higher than usual trading volume.

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal. That stock may be a good candidate for a Moving Average Trend trade (explained in the pages to come). You want to find stocks that are really stretched out to the downside or, for short selling, really stretched out to the upside, in a short period of time, and with high volume at the reversal point. You want to see that large extension, which means that you should look for considerable volume at the reversal point (such as the ALR Bottom Reversal in the above example from my scanner that is marked as Figure 7.13).

A stock that has been selling off slowly all day long is usually not suitable for a reversal.

Once you find that, you then must look for a couple of key indicators that will suggest that the price may be about to turn, and that is when you then take the position. I’ve said it many times: what goes up, must come down.

Oftentimes these stocks will give up days’ and weeks’ or years’ worth of price gain in just a matter of minutes. It is very critical to be able to correctly time the reversal.

I’ll say it again: the key to your success with Top and Bottom Reversals is trading the extremes at or near a significant daily support or resistance level. How do I quantify these extremes? These are a few of the things that I look for:.

An extreme RSI above 90 or below 10 will pique my interest.

A very high volume of shares being traded. Volume is usually increasing with the direction of price action and is at its maximum at the point of reversal.

Finally, more than five consecutive candles ending with an indecision candle or a Doji is definitely going to catch my attention. These candles usually demonstrate that sellers are losing their control while buyers are becoming more powerful, and that indicates the end of a trend.

Sometimes reversals happen without an indecision candlestick. In those cases, you should look for strong reversal candlesticks – a bullish body for Bottom Reversals and a bearish body for Top Reversals.

I will add a caveat to this final point: there will be times when you will have between five and ten consecutive candles without much price action. They may be drifting down slowly, but not quickly enough for you to sense that it is a good reversal. You must look for a combination of these indicators all occurring at the same time. Never try to go short just because the prices are too high. You should never argue with the crowd’s decision or the market, even if it doesn’t make sense to you. You do not have to run with the crowd - but you should not run against.

Many new traders end up trading with a very poor profit-to-loss ratio because they sell their winners too soon and they hold their losers too long. This is an extremely common habit among new traders. The Reversal Strategy, however, lends itself to having a larger profit-to-loss ratio for new traders.

Set up a scanner to flag stocks with four or more consecutive candlesticks going downward in an extreme manner. When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

When I see a stock hit my scanner, I quickly review the volume and daily levels of support or resistance near the stock to see if it will be a good candidate for a reversal trade or not.

I wait for confirmation of a Bottom Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bullish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bullish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant intraday support level, and (3) the RSI must be lower than 10.

When I see the stock make a new 1-minute or 5-minute high, I buy the stock.

My stop loss is the low of the previous red candlestick or the low of the day.

My profit target is either (1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price, described later in this chapter) or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) the stock makes a new 5-minute low, which means that the buyers are exhausted and the sellers are once again gaining control.

(remember, we retail traders look for unusual trading volumes).

Wait for confirmation of a Top Reversal Strategy: (1) formation of a bearish Doji or indecision candle or, instead, a very bearish candlestick, (2) the stock is being traded at or near a significant resistance level at high volume, and (3) the RSI must be higher than 90.

When I see the stock make a new 5-minute low, I consider this as a sign of weakness. I start short selling the stock if I have shares available to short.

(1) the next level of support, or (2) VWAP or 9 EMA or 20 EMA moving averages (whichever is closer), or (3) when the stock makes a new 5-minute high, which means the buyers are once again gaining control and the sellers are exhausted.

Some day traders focus exclusively on reversal trades and in fact base their entire careers on them. Reversal trades are certainly the most classic of the various strategies with a very good risk/reward ratio and, interestingly, virtually every trading day you will find stocks that are good candidates for reversal trades. I myself am trading more and more reversal trades these days, especially during late morning and afternoon trading. However, reversal trading is not yet the cornerstone of my trading strategies. I am more of a VWAP and Support or Resistance trader, which I will explain later on in this book.

These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

In three areas marked on the chart, the price broke the 9 EMA and went slightly higher, but a 5-minute candlestick did not actually close above 9 EMA. These false breakouts usually happen with low volume. Experienced traders wait for a 5-minute candlestick to “close” above 9 EMA before they get out. A sudden break of 9 EMA with low volume may not be a good indicator of a trend coming to an end.

I quickly look at the previous days’ trading data (on a 1-minute or 5-minute chart) to see if the stock is responding to these moving averages.

If the stock is moving really high away from the moving average, offering me an equally really nice unrealized profit, I may take some profit, usually at half-position.

Traders say: you can never go broke by taking good profits. If the price pulls back to the moving average, I may add again to my position and continue the trend trade.

Personally don’t trade very often based on moving averages. I look at them to see potential levels of support or resistance, but I rarely make any trade based upon a trend because, in a trend trade strategy, you are usually left exposed in the market for a considerable length of time. Some trend trades can last as long as several hours and that is too long for my personality. I would like to take my profit in a matter of minutes. I rarely will wait even an hour. Another reason that I do not often trade these strategies is that they usually best work during Mid-day and the Close. At the Open (in the morning session), when volatility is high, it’s hard to identify a Moving Average Trend play. These slow trends are best identified during Mid-day, when there is low volatility, and they usually end near the Close (around 3 p.m. New York time) when the professional traders on Wall Street start to dominate the trading.

The combination of all of these factors have led me to be a VWAP trader who sometimes trades with the Opening Range Breakout Strategy.

However, I want to emphasize that trading strategies are not something that you can imitate just from reading a book, speaking with a mentor, or attending a class. You have to slowly and methodically develop your preferred method and then stick with it. There is nothing wrong with any strategy if it works for you. There is no good and bad in any of these strategies; it truly is a matter of personal choice.

VWAP is an indicator of who is in control of the price action - the buyers or the sellers. When stock is traded above the VWAP, it means that the buyers are in overall control of the price and there is a buying demand on the stock. When a stock price breaks below the VWAP, it is safe to assume that the sellers are gaining control over the price action.

VWAP is often used to measure the trading efficiency of institutional traders. Professional traders working for investment banks or hedge funds who need to trade large amount of shares each day cannot enter or exit the market by just one single order. The market is not liquid enough to enter a one-million share buy order. Therefore, they need to liquidate their orders slowly during the day. After buying or selling a large position in a stock during the day, institutional traders compare their price to VWAP values.

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market).

A buy order executed below the VWAP would be considered a good fill for them because the stock was bought at a below average price (meaning that the trader has bought their large position at a relatively discounted price compared to the market). Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points.

Conversely, a sell order executed above the VWAP would be deemed a good fill because it was sold at an above average price. Therefore, VWAP is used by institutional traders to identify good entry and exit points. Institutional traders with large orders try to buy or sell large positions around VWAP.

Traders who buy significantly higher than VWAP may be penalized because they cost the institution money for taking that large position. Institutional traders therefore try to buy below or as close to VWAP as possible. Conversely, when a professional trader has to get rid of a large position, they try to sell at the VWAP or higher. Day traders who know this may benefit from this market activity.

Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

After the market opens, the Stock in Play will trade heavily in the first five minutes. If the Stock in Play has gapped up, some individual shareholders, hedge funds or investment banks may want to as soon as possible sell their shares for a profit, before the price drops. At the same time, some investors wanting to take positions in the stock want to buy as soon as possible before the price goes even higher. Therefore, in the first five minutes, an unknown heavy trading is happening between the overnight shareholders and the new investors.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher.

This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

After volatility decreases around ten to fifteen minutes into the Open, the stock will move toward or away from the VWAP. This is a test to see if there is a large investment bank waiting to buy or sell. If there is a large institutional trader aiming to buy a significant position, the stock will pop over the VWAP and move even higher. This is a good opportunity for us day traders to go long.

Conversely, if there are large shareholders wanting to get rid of their shares, then this is a good point for them to liquidate their positions. They start selling their shares at the VWAP. The price will reject the VWAP and start to move down. This is an excellent short selling opportunity for day traders. If there is no interest in the stock from market makers or institutions, the price may trade sideways near VWAP. Wise traders will then stay away from that stock.

When a stock tries to break the VWAP but cannot, you can short the stock because you can safely assume that the other traders that are watching will also begin to short. A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts. Let's.

When a stock tries to break the VWAP but cannot, you can short the stock because you can safely assume that the other traders that are watching will also begin to short. A trading strategy based on VWAP is a simple and easy strategy to follow. I usually short stocks when traders try but fail to break the VWAP on 5-minute charts.

I sold another position at $22 because I know half-dollars (such as $1.50, $2.50, $3.50) and whole dollars ($1, $2, $3) usually act at a support or resistance level.

When I make my watchlist for the day, I monitor the price action around VWAP at the Open. If a stock shows respect toward VWAP, then I wait until a confirmation of the VWAP break (for short selling) or VWAP support (for going long).

I usually buy as close as possible to VWAP to minimize my risk. My stop will be a break and a close 5-minute close below VWAP. For short selling, I short near VWAP with a stop loss of a close above the VWAP. I keep the trade until I hit my profit target or until I reach a new support or resistance level. I usually sell half-positions near the profit target or support or resistance level and move my stop up to my entry point or break-even.

Many traders love to draw diagonal trend lines. I’m not one of them.

Horizontal support or resistance trading is my favorite style of trading. Because market only remembers price levels, which is why horizontal support or resistance lines on previous price levels make sense, but diagonal trend lines aren’t. In fact, in my opinion, trend lines are among the most deceptive of all tools in trading. I therefore avoid trend lines.

Traders buy at support and sell at resistance, making their effectiveness a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Chapter 4: a stock that has fundamental catalysts such as news, an extreme earnings report or a new drug approval.

Finding price support or resistance levels is tricky and requires trading experience. If you watch me trading every morning, you will see how I place my support or resistance lines on my Stocks in Play.

In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or Moving Averages or other chart patterns that I earlier discussed.

You will usually see indecision candles in the area of support or resistance because that is where buyers and sellers are closely fighting each other.

For day trading, it is better to draw support or resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support or resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on. Previous extreme high and low wicks have been made by day traders, so you should look at those.

All of these levels are extreme price levels for the previous days and, as I explained, I give more attention to wicks and extreme prices than I do to the open or close prices.

Do you see that they are significantly higher near those levels? A high volume confirms that these levels are significant and day traders should pay attention to them.

If the current price of a stock is higher than the previous day close (for Stocks in Play that gapped up), the market is moving from a Green day to a Red day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be negative, which will be shown as red in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Green-to-Red move.

The previous day close is a powerful level of support or resistance and traders should trade toward it when there is rising volume.

If the price is lower than the previous day close (for stocks that gapped down), the market is moving from a Red day to a Green day (meaning that the percentage that the price has changed will now be positive, which will be shown as green in most of the Exchanges and platforms). This is a Red-to-Green move.

After a weak Open, the price held below VWAP. I went short, but there was no nearby support or resistance level except the previous day close at $46.52 (the dashed line on my chart). Therefore, I decided to go short from VWAP at around $47.80 for the profit target of the previous day close at $46.52, a nice $1.20 per share profit.

If a stock moves toward the previous day close with high volume, I consider going long with the profit target of the previous day close.

My stop loss is the nearest technical level. If I buy near VWAP, my stop loss will be the break of VWAP. If I buy near a moving average or an important support level, my stop loss will be the break of moving average or support level.

I usually sell all at the profit target. If the price moves in my favor, I bring my stop loss to the break-even and do not let the price turn against me. Red-to-Green moves should work immediately.

Typically, you want to give the opening range at least five minutes. This is called the 5-minute Opening Range Breakout (ORB). Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers.

Some traders will wait even longer, such as for thirty minutes or even for one hour, to identify the balance of the power between the buyers and sellers. They then develop a trade plan in the direction of the 30-minute or 60-minute breakout. In the past, I only traded the trade at the 5-minute ORB, but recently I am more in favor of the 15-minute ORB or the 30-minute ORB. The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range.

The longer the time frame, the less volatility you can expect compared to the 5-minute range. As with most setups, the ORB Strategy tends to work best with mid to large cap stocks, which do not show wild price swings intraday.

Ideally, the stock should trade within a range which is smaller than the Average True Range of the stock (ATR).

For me, stop loss is always a close above VWAP for short positions, and a break below VWAP for long positions.

As I have mentioned, you need the opening range to be smaller than the daily ATR. If a stock moves near or higher than its ATR at the Open, it is not a good candidate for the ORB Strategy. It means that the stock is too volatile and without a catchable move. It is worth mentioning again, Stocks in Play move, and those moves are directional and catchable. If a stock constantly moves up and down $2 with high volume, but without any directional signal, you want to stay away from it. Those stocks are usually being heavily traded by computers.

For example, if its price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness, and you should consider selling if you are long. If you are short and if the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and you may want to cover your short position.

I prefer stocks that have high volume, but also with numerous different orders being traded.

Volume alone does not show the liquidity; the number of orders being sent to the Exchange is as important.

If there was no obvious technical level for the exit and profit target, I exit when a stock shows signs of weakness (if I am long) or strength (if I am short).

For example, if the price makes a new 5-minute low, that means weakness and I consider selling my position if I am long. If I am short and the stock makes a new 5-minute high, then it could be a sign of strength and I consider covering my short position.

You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

I might not be comfortable with a $500 loss, but someone who has a large account can easily hold onto the loss and eventually make profit out of a losing trade. You cannot mirror-trade anyone else; you must develop your own risk management method and strategy.

Day trading is not mechanical and automated; it is discretionary: traders need to make real time decisions. The success of each strategy is based on judgment and the proper execution of it by the trader.

I don’t think that having more indicators on your chart helps you in day trading.

I don’t think that having more indicators on your chart helps you in day trading, especially since you need to be able to process information very quickly, at times in just a matter of seconds.

I don’t think that having more indicators on your chart helps you in day trading, especially since you need to be able to process information very quickly, at times in just a matter of seconds. I have found that often indicators’ signals will also contradict each other and that will lead to confusion.

For my swing trading, I use more complicated indicators such as MACD because I do not have to make quick decisions. I usually review my swing trading after the market closes, with proper due diligence and evaluation. You can easily find more information about the indicators I’ve mentioned in this section, along with many others, by doing a simple online search.

When you set up a system for trading that has no input or requires no decisions by the trader, then you are entering the world of algorithmic trading, and you will lose trades to investment banks that have million-dollar algorithms and billions of dollars in cash for trading.

I don't expect everything I do to work exactly the same for you. I am happy to help you develop a strategy that is going to work for you, your personality, your account size and your risk tolerance.

The key for now is that you master one strategy. Once you can tread water in the market with your one strategy, you can be a trader without blowing up your account. This is simply a matter of spending time in the chair. The more time you spend watching your charts, the more you will learn.

It is absolutely critical for every trader to be trading a strategy. Plan a trade, and trade the plan. I wish someone had said to me when I first started training, “Andrew, you need to trade a strategy. If you're trading with real money, you must be trading a written strategy, and it must have historical data to verify that it’s worth trading with real money.” You cannot change your plan once you have already entered the trade and have an open position.

The truth about traders is that they fail. They lose money, and a large percentage of those traders are not gaining the education that you are receiving from reading this book.

The truth about traders is that they fail. They lose money, and a large percentage of those traders are not gaining the education that you are receiving from reading this book. They're going to be using live trading strategies that are not even hammered out, they will just be haphazardly trading a little of this and a little of that until their account is gone, and then they will wonder what happened.

You don’t want to live trade a new strategy until you’ve proven that it’s worth investing in. You may practice three months in a simulator, and then trade small size with real money for one month, and then go back to the simulator to work on your mistakes or practice new strategies for another three months. There is no shame in going back to a simulator at any stage of your day trading career.

Remember, the market is always going to be there. You don't need to rush this. A day trading career is a marathon and not a sprint. It's not about making $50,000 by the end of next week. It’s about developing a set of skills that will last a lifetime.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day.

A review of my trades indicates that I do the worst during the Mid-day. Accordingly, should I decide to trade during the Mid-day, I lower my share size and keep my stops tight.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day.

New traders tend to overtrade at Mid-day. At times, good trading, and smart trading, is to not be trading at all.

Watch the stocks, prepare for the Close, and be very, very careful with any trading you do.

Reversal, VWAP, Moving Average, and Support or Resistance trades tend to be the best strategies for the Mid-day. I never trade Bull Flag Momentum in Mid-day or at the Close.

If the stock is moving higher in the last hour, it means the professionals are probably bullish on that stock. If the stock is moving lower in the last hour, the market professionals are probably bearish. It is thus a good idea to trade with the professionals and not against them.

VWAP, Support or Resistance, and Moving Average trades tend to be the best strategies for the Close.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them.

Many traders lose during the day what they have profited in the Open. Don’t be one of them. I created a rule for myself. I am not allowed to lose more than 30% of what I have made in the Open during Mid-day and the Close. If I lose more than the allowed 30%, then I either stop trading or start trading in a simulator.

(which meant the stock on average moves in a range as large as $1.86 during the day).

I looked at the chart and decided to wait and see the price action for the first ten minutes of trading.

My philosophy in trading is that you need to master only a few solid setups to be consistently profitable. In fact, having a simple trading method consisting of a few minimal setups will help to reduce confusion and stress and allow you to concentrate more on the psychological aspect of trading, which is truly what separates the winners from the losers.

Now that you have learned the basics of a few trading strategies, let’s review the actual process of planning and making a trade.

You now understand the setup you want to trade, but as a beginner trader, you will have a hard time planning and initiating a trade beforehand.

I have a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, so I firmly believe in the process approach to trading.

My trading process looks like this: Morning routine Develop my watchlist Organize a trade plan Initiate the trade according to plan Execute the trade according to plan Journaling and reflection.

Everyone can read this book or dozens of other books, but only a few people have the discipline to execute correctly. You might have a good setup but select a wrong stock to trade, such as a stock that is being manipulated by computers and institutional traders. Perhaps you will find a proper stock to trade, but you will enter the trade at the wrong time. A bad entry will make a mess of your plan and you will eventually lose your money. You can find a good stock to trade and enter a trade correctly, but if you don’t exit properly, you will turn a winning trade into a losing one. All of the steps of the process are important.

Think about something significant that you do frequently in your life, and then think of how it can best be done. Now, consider how you do it currently. This is a great thought process for traders to have.

Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.

There are scientific studies showing that aerobic exercise has a positive effect on the decision making process.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself.

Very often, our moods are influenced by our physical state, even by factors as delicate as what and how much we eat. Keep a record of your daily trading results as a function of your physical condition and you will see these relationships for yourself. Begin preventive maintenance by keeping body, and thus mind, in their peak operating condition. I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol, and I have stopped eating animal-based food, and my performance levels have increased significantly.

Wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I.

I wondered to myself, are these people well-dressed, confident, in great physical shape and disciplined because they are rich and successful or did they become rich and successful because they were disciplined, confident and ambitious? I think this is a chicken and egg problem with no real answer, but I believe it is the latter.

If you have always wanted to be in better physical shape, try adding exercises such as running into your routine, and also take control of your salt and sugar intake. If you drink too much alcohol or coffee, try to see if for one month you can stay away from them. These are excellent tests to see if you are emotionally and intellectually strong enough or not to discipline yourself in the face of a losing trade.

Change is hard, but if you wish to be a successful trader, you need to work on changing and developing your personality at every level.

Often traders who fail to make money in trading get frustrated and go out and study more about the market to learn new strategies and additional technical indicators. They don’t realize that their lack of self-discipline, impulsive behavior and their bad life habits are the main cause of their failure, not their technical knowledge.

You have to find one strategy that suits your personality and practice it in your simulator, and then practice it some more. And then you have to stick to it. Like glue.

You also have to have settled in your mind, again, in advance, how much you can afford to risk on any one trade.

Day trading requires a certain mindset, as well as a discipline and a set of skills that not everyone possesses. Interestingly, most of the traders I know are also poker players.

Keep your strategy simple. When you have a solid strategy that you’ve mastered, make sure there is no emotion attached to it. Keep practicing it, and then start practicing a second strategy, and learn to incrementally add size in those strategies.

Move to a real account only after at least three months of training with a simulated account and then, start small, with real money. Trade small while you’re learning or when you are feeling stressed. If you wish, you can always have a chat with me in our chatroom and receive some advice and guidance.

Remember, baby steps.

Master one topic, and then and only then move on to the next.

Most traders struggle when they first begin, and many do not have sufficient time in the morning to practice in real time. Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months.

Those who can give trading more time when they start have a better chance to succeed. How long does it take to be a consistently profitable trader? I don’t think anyone can become a consistently profitable trader in less than three or four months. After four months of paper trading, you need at least another three months of trading in small share size to master your emotions and practice self-discipline while trading with your real money.

After six months, you may become a seasoned trader. Eight months is probably better than six months, and twelve months is perhaps better than both.

Many traders think of inspiring goals such as making a million dollars or being able to trade for a living from a beach house in the Caribbean.

A good trading day is a day when you are disciplined and you trade sound strategies.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult.

If you don’t have this luxury, maybe swing trading is better for you. But making a living out of swing trading is more difficult. The best swing traders can expect an annual return of 20% on their account size. Day traders, on the other hand, look to profit between 0.5-1% of their account size daily.

Learn as much as you can, but keep a degree of healthy skepticism about everything, including this book.

Amateurs, on the other hand, are focused on making money every single day.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money,.

P&L is not important when novices first begin trading with real money, especially when smaller share sizes are involved.

Your goal is to develop trading skills and not to make money. You must focus on getting better every single day, one trade after another. That is How to Day Trade for a Living . Push your comfort zone to find greater success.

“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”.

Review daily charts and identify important levels of support or resistance. I do not make a trade unless I know the average volume, Average True Range, important technical levels, short interest, and fresh news for the Stocks in Play.

Each day, traders shouldn’t choose more than two or three of these stocks to focus on.

Most professional traders do not arrive later than 7:30 a.m. New York time. Certainly experienced traders with a strong community and powerful scanners can stroll in later, but 9 a.m. is the latest that most serious traders arrive.

Every trade is a new puzzle that you must solve.

Before making a trade, you must create a plan for your trades or a series of “ if-then ” statements. Develop some plans as to when you might take a position in one of your stocks on your watchlist. If you see the x scenario, then you will buy at this price. Continue creating “if-then” scenarios for each outcome.

If the price cannot push higher than VWAP in the first fifteen minutes of the market Open, then I will go short until the previous day close of $48.10.

If the price does sell off to the previous day close of $48.10, then I will go long and ride the reversal to the VWAP.

If the price pushes over VWAP with high volume, then I will go long and ride the momentum to sell at the next resistance level of $53.25.

If the price breaks over the daily level of $53.25, then I will go long again until the daily level of $55.50 (which is not shown on the above Figure 9.2).

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers?.

Who is in control of the price: the buyers or the sellers? What technical levels are most important? Is this stock stronger or weaker than the market? Where is most of the volume being traded? At the VWAP? Or the first five minutes? Or near moving averages? How much volume at a price causes the stock to move up or down? What is the bid-ask spread? Is it tradeable? How quickly does the stock move? Is it being traded smoothly or is it choppy, jumping up and down with every trade? Is the stock trading in a particular pattern on a 5-minute chart? How is the stock being traded on a 1-minute chart? These are some of the questions that I ask myself and then answer before trading a stock. All of this information should be gathered before you make any trade. This is what we mean by hard work. As you can see, day trading is an intense intellectual pursuit which requires hard work. Remember Rule 2?.

Turning off the PC early after a few bad trades is a strategy that should be reserved for the rare occasions when it is absolutely essential to give your brain a break. Usually, spending some time in a simulator after some losses will clear your mind sufficiently. Novice traders using a simulator should keep on trading and practicing until the Close. After all, trading in the simulator is not nearly as stressful as real trading with real money. Using a simulator with no commission and no P&L is still no excuse for overtrading. At all times the focus must be on sound strategies with excellent risk/reward opportunities.

Discipline is executing your detailed plan every single time. If your plan is to buy a stock at VWAP and your stop loss is if it fails to hold VWAP, then you must accept the loss immediately and get out of the trade if the stock fails to hold the VWAP.

The market does not reward stubbornness.

Do not judge your trading strategy based upon one trade. Executing your plan, and being disciplined, will lead to long-term success. Many times your plan will be fine and solid but a hedge fund manager out of nowhere will decide to liquidate a position in a stock that you are trading, the price will drop suddenly and you will get stopped out.

A professional trader accepts the loss and gets out of the trade. You then re-evaluate and plan another if-then scenario. You can always get back into the stock. Commissions are cheap (for most of the brokers), and professionals often take several quick stabs at a trade before it will start running in their favor.

Trading teaches you a great deal about yourself, about your mental weaknesses and about your strengths. This alone ensures that trading is a valuable life experience.

“ There is no question in my mind that, if I were to start trading full-time, knowing what I know now, I would either join a proprietary trading firm or would form my own “virtual trading group” by connecting online (and in real time) with a handful of like-minded traders.

Make sure to include the following points in your trading journal: Your physical well-being (lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much food the night before, etc.) The time of the day you made the trade The strategy you were anticipating How you found the opportunity (from a scanner, a chatroom, etc.) Quality of your entry (risk/reward) Sizing/management of your trade (scaling in and out as planned) Execution of exits (following profit targets or stop losses) I personally take a screenshot from my screen (with a free software called Screenshot Captor ) and journal my trades in my blog with that software. Please visit my blog to get some ideas on how to journal your trades. You do not have to follow my style, but you should find what works best for you because to be successful, you must journal your trades daily.

One Good Trade that the professional traders at his firm video-record all of their trades during the day.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively.

For example, for the first month live, new traders should only trade Support or Resistance or VWAP trades. The next month, new traders can shift to reversal trades exclusively. The next month, you should focus on Moving Average Trend trades.

When you first begin, you must focus on the process of trading, not on how to make money for a living.

When you first begin, you must focus on the process of trading, not on how to make money for a living. You must allow at least eight to twelve months before you will become consistently profitable.

If we stubbornly insist on trying to prove to the market that we are right, we will pay a high price.

If you are passionate about trading and never try it, then you will live your life wondering what might have been.
