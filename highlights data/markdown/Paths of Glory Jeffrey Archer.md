“But He must have noticed that women are often blessed with more common sense than men. I’m sure He’s aware that Avie is far brighter than either Trafford or me.”.

Some days. George pretended to be equally nonchalant.

As always, the descent was going to be more difficult than the ascent.

He had long ago stopped complaining about his friend’s inability to understand the purpose of a watch.

Their way to prep school had changed his whole life. While others sometimes found George tactless, even arrogant, if he allowed them into his confidence they also discovered kindness, generosity, and humor in equal measure.

‘If you can win a battle without having to fire a shot in anger, you are the true victor.’”.

“When you’re climbing up a rock face, your hands are not more than a few inches from your eyes, but when you’re coming down, your feet are never less than five feet below you, which means that when you look down you’ve far more chance of losing your balance. Got the idea?”.

She disguised it determinedly beneath layers of jumpers and jodhpurs.

Cottie could not have been described as beautiful in the conventional sense, but George had rarely enjoyed a woman’s company more. She was just an inch over five feet, and if she possessed a pleasing figure, she disguised it determinedly beneath layers of jumpers and jodhpurs. Her freckled face and curly brown hair gave the impression of a tomboy. But that wasn’t what had attracted George to her.

“My father once told me that only politicians are expected to answer a question with a question.”.

The two men smiled slightly ruefully, as if they’d won a silver medal at the Olympic Games.

“A victory’s a victory,” said Finch. “Ask any Epirote.

Which stretched as far as the eye could see. “It’s one of the ironies of mountaineering,” said Young, “that grown men are happy to spend months preparing for a climb, weeks rehearsing and honing their skills, and at least a day attempting to reach the summit. And then having achieved their goal, they spend just.

“It’s one of the ironies of mountaineering,” said Young, “that grown men are happy to spend months preparing for a climb, weeks rehearsing and honing their skills, and at least a day attempting to reach the summit. And then having achieved their goal, they spend just a few moments enjoying the experience, along with one or two equally certifiable companions who have little in common other than wanting to do it all again, but a little higher.”.

“I’d rather be a dull success than a bright failure,”.

“But all work and no play…”.

George still couldn’t be sure how well he’d done. Only the very clever and the very stupid ever are.

“that we are about to learn of his plans to make a second attempt to be the first of His Majesty’s subjects to reach the South Pole. It is a well-worn phrase to suggest that a speaker needs no introduction, but I suspect there isn’t a man, woman, or child in our land who does.

It stands at over 29,000 feet above sea level—that’s almost five and a half miles high, my boy—and we have no idea how the human body will react to such altitude, as no man has yet been above 22,000 feet. And that’s before you consider temperatures that can fall below minus forty degrees Fahrenheit, and winds that will cut your skin to shreds. But of one thing I am certain: dogs and motorized sledges will be of little use up there.”.

“I am an amateur,” he eventually replied, “but an amateur who surrounds himself with professionals. My doctors, engineers, drivers, and even my cooks are all fully qualified, and would be insulted were you to describe them as amateurs. But they would be even more insulted if you were to suggest that their presence on this expedition was motivated by a desire for financial gain.”.

“WHEN ELIZABETH ASCENDED the English throne in 1558, neither the court nor the common people welcomed her as their monarch. However, when she died in 1603, forty-five years later, the Virgin Queen was as popular as her father King Henry the Eighth had ever been.”.

Believe that the same rule should apply to women as it does to men. The stupid ones should get a vote as well.”.

“The last theater production we attended was Charley’s Aunt in the village hall, and that was only after the vicar had banned a reading of The Importance of Being Earnest.”.

“Chomolungma, Goddess Mother of the Earth.”.

“‘Everest’ is the name the English have labeled her with, but it’s not the one she answers to.”.

I’m going to have breakfast with this woman every morning for the rest of my life.

“A conscientious objector. Someone who will use any excuse not to fight for his country,”.

“Everyone should be allowed to follow their own conscience, Wainwright, when it comes to facing a moral dilemma.”.

He held her in his arms until she finally fell into a deep sleep.

Daddy, what did YOU do in the Great War?.

Realize, sir, that under the terms of the new Conscription.

Conscription.

Let’s hope the politicians are right when they call this the war to end all wars, because I wouldn’t want my children ever to experience this madness.

Astor’s speech is nothing more than a red herring.”.

“Perhaps that’s because I didn’t feel one’s place of birth, educational qualifications, and marital status had much to do with attempting to climb the highest mountain on earth.”.

Once you know a man’s ambition, if you can assist it, he becomes beholden to you.

We must not forget that no Englishman has ever been within forty miles of Everest, let alone set up a base camp on its lower slopes.”.

“I am not willing to leave my wife and children for at least six months to take part in a mission that failed simply because it left its finest climber behind.”.

The first thing that struck him as he made his way down the wobbly gangplank was the smell—what Kipling had described as spicy, pungent, oriental, and like no other smell on earth.

On our way back.” “That may depend on whether we return as conquering heroes or frostbitten.

“That may depend on whether we return as conquering heroes or frostbitten failures,”.

“That doesn’t mean you will be,” said George. “No, I won’t. I’ll be upstairs in his lady’s chamber.”.

Altitudes none of us has ever experienced before. Never forget: climb high, sleep.

Altitudes none of us has ever experienced before. Never forget: climb high, sleep low.”.

At last their eyes met, and he saw that smile she reserved only for those she truly cared for.

“I didn’t think. I allowed my personal ambition to cloud my judgment.”.

I would rather have spent two years with one of the most exciting men on earth, than forty with someone who thought I had prevented him from fulfilling his dream.”.

Mallory looked back down at the young man and smiled. “You should read H. G. Wells, my boy. He believes that, in time, mankind will be able, like Puck, to put a circle round the earth in forty minutes, that someone will one day break the sound barrier, with consequences we have yet to comprehend, and that in your lifetime, though perhaps not in mine, a man.

AND THEN THERE were three. George rose long before dawn to witness a full moon glistening on the snow, making it look like a lawn of finely cut diamonds.

Mallory, Odell, and Irvine, accompanied by five Sherpas carrying tents, equipment, and provisions, left the North Col just after 7:30 on the morning of June 6th.

He was surprised to find that once they had attained the prize, the rush of adrenaline had deserted him, and all he had left was the will to survive.
