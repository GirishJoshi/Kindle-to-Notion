But the outcome will also depend heavily on such surprising factors as his personality, the amount of emotional stress he experiences over the years, whether he has someone’s shoulder to cry on when those stressors occur.

As part of updating the material for this third edition, I have added two new chapters: one on the interactions between stress and sleep, and one on what stress has to do with addiction.

Yet most of us are not incapacitated by stress-related disease. Instead, we cope, both physiologically and psychologically, and some of us are spectacularly successful at it.

I love science, and it pains me to think that so many are terrified of the subject or feel that choosing science means that you cannot also choose compassion, or the arts, or be awed by nature. Science is not meant to cure us of mystery, but to reinvent and reinvigorate it.

There is a tradition among stress physiologists who dedicate their books to their spouses or significant others, an unwritten rule that you are supposed to incorporate something cutesy about stress in the dedication. So, to Madge, who attenuates my stressors; for Arturo, the source of my eustress; for my wife who, over the course of the last umpteen years, has put up with my stress-induced hypertension, ulcerative colitis, loss of libido, and displaced aggression. I will forgo that style in the actual dedication of this book to my wife, as I have something simpler to say.

The diseases that plague us now are ones of slow accumulation of damage—heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disorders.

This book is a primer about stress, stress-related disease, and the mechanisms of coping with stress. How is it that our bodies can adapt to some stressful emergencies, while other ones make us sick? Why are some of us especially vulnerable to stress-related diseases, and what does that have to do with our personalities?.

How many hippos worry about whether Social Security is going to last as long as they will, or what they are going to say on a first date? Viewed from the perspective of the evolution of the animal kingdom, sustained psychological stress is a recent invention, mostly limited to humans and other social primates.

For animals like zebras, the most upsetting things in life are acute physical crises.

An organism can also be plagued by chronic physical challenges.

Drought, famine, parasites, that sort of unpleasantness—not the sort of experience we have often, but central events in the lives of non-westernized humans and most other mammals.

Critical to this book is a third category of ways to get upset—psychological and social disruptions.

Chess grand masters, during their tournaments, can place metabolic demands on their bodies that begin to approach those of athletes during the peak of a competitive event.

We can experience wildly strong emotions (provoking our bodies into an accompanying uproar) linked to mere thoughts.

And if someone spends months on end twisting his innards in anxiety, anger, and tension over some emotional problem, this might very well lead to illness.

Ah, that dimly remembered concept, the idea that the body has an ideal level of oxygen that it needs, an ideal degree of acidity, an ideal temperature, and so on. All these different variables are maintained in homeostatic balance, the state in which all sorts of physiological measures are being kept at the optimal level. The brain, it has been noted, has evolved to seek homeostasis.

But when we get into a physiological uproar and activate the stress-response for no reason at all, or over something we cannot do anything about, we call it things like “anxiety,” “neurosis,” “paranoia,” or “needless hostility.”.

Homeostasis is about tinkering with this valve or that gizmo. Allostasis is about the brain coordinating body-wide changes, often including changes in behavior.

One of the hallmarks of the stress-response is the rapid mobilization of energy from storage sites and the inhibition of further storage.

You have better things to do than digest breakfast when you are trying to avoid being someone’s lunch.

During stress, growth and tissue repair is curtailed, sexual drive decreases in both sexes; females are less likely to ovulate or to carry pregnancies to term, while males begin to have trouble with erections and secrete less testosterone.

If you constantly mobilize energy at the cost of energy storage, you will never store any surplus energy. You will fatigue more rapidly, and your risk of developing a form of diabetes will even increase.

But if you constantly try to balance a seesaw with two elephants instead of two little kids, all sorts of problems will emerge:.

The half of the autonomic nervous system that is turned on is called the sympathetic nervous system.

The sympathetic nervous system kicks into action during emergencies, or what you think are emergencies. It helps mediate vigilance, arousal, activation, mobilization. To generations of first-year medical students, it is described through the obligatory lame joke about the sympathetic nervous system mediating the four F’s of behavior—flight, fight, fright, and sex.

If a neuron (a cell of the nervous system) secretes a chemical messenger that travels a thousandth of an inch and causes the next cell in line (typically, another neuron) to do something different, that messenger is called a neurotransmitter.

This realization gave rise to the memorable cliché that the pituitary is the master gland of the body.

The other, less polished but more honest, said the competition was all that drove him for decades and described his relationship with his co-winner as “many years of vicious attacks and bitter retaliation.”.

(Are you overwhelmed and intimidated by these terms, wondering if you should have bought some Deepak Chopra self-help book instead? Please, don’t even dream of memorizing these names of hormones. The important ones are going to appear so regularly in the coming pages that you will soon be comfortably and accurately slipping them into everyday conversation and birthday cards to favorite cousins. Trust me.).

By the end of this book you will be astonishingly informed about glucocorticoid trivia, since I am in love with these hormones.

Taylor argues convincingly that the physiology of the stress-response can be quite different in females, built around the fact that in most species, females are typically less aggressive than males, and that having dependent young often precludes the option of flight.

Moreover, oxytocin may be critical for a female to form a monogamous pair bond with a male (in the relatively few mammalian species that are monogamous).

For example, while stress causes a prompt decline in the secretion of growth hormone in rats, it causes a transient increase in growth hormone secretion in humans (this puzzle and its implication for humans are discussed in the chapter on growth).

A question no doubt at the forefront of every reader’s mind at this point: if one of the features of the cardiovascular stress-response is to conserve water in the circulation, and this is accomplished by inhibition of urine formation in the kidneys, why is it that when we are really terrified, we wet our pants?.

Basically, your heart is just a dumb, simple mechanical pump, and your blood vessels are nothing more exciting than hoses. The cardiovascular stress-response essentially consists of making them work harder for a while, and if you do that on a regular basis, they will wear out, just like any pump or hose you’d buy at Sears.

In the last few years, it is becoming clear that the amount of damaged, inflamed blood vessels is a better predictor of cardiovascular trouble than is the amount of circulating crud.

Means that your legs and chest hurt like hell for lack of oxygen and glucose whenever you walk; you are then a candidate for bypass surgery.

(reminding one of the oft-quoted statement by Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate writer and Holocaust survivor: “The opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of love is indifference.”).

This is the case among people in non-westernized populations. The disease is not, therefore, a normal feature of aging; instead, it is a disease of inactivity and fat surplus, conditions that just happen to be more common with age in some societies.).

Glucocorticoids.

Congratulations, you now have a “functional” GI disorder.

An ulcer is a hole in the wall of an organ, and ulcers originating in the stomach or in the organs immediately bordering it are termed peptic ulcers.

Clinicians celebrated at never having again to sit down with their ulcer patients, make some serious eye contact, and ask them how their lives were going.

There’s nothing like parenthood to make you really neurotic, as you worry about the consequences of your every act, thought, or omission.

You only want perfection for the ones you love beyond words, so you get nutsy at times.

What is childhood about? It is a time when you make assessments about the nature of the world.

“If something is hidden underneath something else, it still exists.”.

“Even if Mommy disappears for a while, she will come back because Mommy always comes back.”.

I will suggest that this arises from having learned at a premature age a deep emotional lesson about the nature of life, namely, that this is a world in which awful things can happen over which you have no control.

Consider a female who is pregnant during a famine. She’s not getting enough calories, nor is her fetus. It turns out that during the latter part of pregnancy, a fetus is “learning” about how plentiful food is in that outside world, and a famine winds up “teaching” it that, jeez, there’s not a whole lot of food out there, better store every smidgen of it. Something about the metabolism of that fetus shifts permanently, a feature called metabolic “imprinting” or “programming.” Forever after, that fetus will be particularly good at storing the food it consumes, at retaining every grain of precious salt from the diet. Forever after, that fetus develops what has been termed a “thrifty” metabolism.

Everything else being equal throughout life, even late in life, that organism is more at risk for hypertension, obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Fetal Origins of Adult Disease.

And then the chapter informs us that the boy became the author of the much-beloved children’s classic—Peter Pan. J. M. Barrie’s writings are filled with children who didn’t grow up, who were fortunate enough to die in childhood, who came back as ghosts to visit their mothers.

To take a concrete, nuts and bolts feature of growth, the rate at which this child was depositing calcium in his long bones could be successfully predicted by his proximity to a loved one.

You can’t ask for a clearer demonstration that what is going on in our heads influences every cell in our bodies.

Sometimes a stressor can be the failure to provide something essential, and the absence of touch is seemingly one of the most marked developmental stressors that we can suffer.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet.

The Cornell anthropologist Merideth Small has written a wonderfully un-neurotic book, Our Babies, Ourselves, which looks at child-rearing practices across the planet. In a particular culture, how often is a child typically held by parents, by non-parents? Do babies sleep alone ever and, if so, starting at what age? What is the average length of time that a child cries in a particular culture before she is picked up and comforted?.

Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

An infant human or animal can be well fed, maintained at an adequate temperature, peered at nervously, and ministered to by the best of neonatologists, yet still not thrive. Something is still missing. Perhaps we can even risk scientific credibility and detachment and mention the word love here, because that most ephemeral of phenomena lurks between the lines of this chapter. Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.

All the experts believed that affection not only wasn’t needed for development but was a squishy, messy thing that kept kids from becoming upright, independent citizens. Yet young organisms were able to teach about how these savants were wrong in a classic set of studies begun in the 1950s—studies that are, in my opinion, among the most haunting and troubling of all the pages of science.

Kids don’t love their mothers because Mom balances their nutritive intake, these results suggested. They love them because, usually, Mom loves them back, or at least is someone soft to cling to. “Man cannot live by milk alone. Love is an emotion that does not need to be bottle- or spoon-fed,” wrote Harlow.

They have taught us the science of why we primates love individuals who treat us badly, why the mistreatment can at times increase the love. They have taught us about why being abused as a child increases the risk of your being an abusive adult.

The Stress of My Life.

Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

As will be discussed in chapter 9, endorphins play a role in blocking pain perception and are secreted in response to exercise (helping to account for the famed “runner’s high” or “endorphin high” that hits many hardy joggers around the 30-minute mark).

Getting an erection to work properly is so incredibly complicated physiologically that if men ever actually had to understand it, none of us would be here.

This is accomplished by activating his parasympathetic nervous system. In other words, the guy has to be calm, vegetative, relaxed.

(Incredibly complicated choreography between these two systems; don’t try this unsupervised.).

This new understanding generates tricks that sexual therapists advise—if you are close to ejaculating and don’t want to yet, take a deep breath. Expanding the chest muscles briefly triggers a parasympathetic volley that defers the shift from parasympathetic to sympathetic.

Turns out that they are fabulous hunters. And you know what happens? Lions, who are not particularly effective hunters, because they are big and slow and conspicuous, spend most of their time keying in on hyenas and ripping off their kills. No wonder when it’s dawn on the savanna the hyenas on the periphery are looking cranky, with circles under their eyes. They stayed up all night hunting that thing, and who’s having breakfast now?.

This hasn’t yet been demonstrated, but perhaps Berkeley scientists working on this, squandering tax dollars that could otherwise be going to Halliburton and Bechtel, will do.

An enzyme in the fat cells of females usually eliminates these androgens by converting them to estrogens.

There is a small amount of male sex hormone in the bloodstream of females, even non-hyena females.

In human beings, this doesn’t come from the ovaries (as in the hyenas), but from the adrenals. The amount of these “adrenal androgens” is only about 5 percent of that in males, but enough to cause trouble.*.

Scientists have called them the original affluent society.

Instead, they typically act for the good of their own genetic legacy and that of their close relatives.

The evidence for the brain’s influence on the immune system goes back at least a century, dating to the first demonstration that if you waved an artificial rose in front of someone who is highly allergic to roses (and who didn’t know it was a fake), they’d get an allergic response.

Such immune defenses are brought about by a complex array of circulating cells called lymphocytes and monocytes (which are collectively known as white blood cells; cyte is a term for cells).

What the data show: the fewer social relationships a person has, the shorter his or her life expectancy, and the worse the impact of various infectious diseases.

For the same illness, people with the fewest social connections have approximately two-and-a-half times as much chance of dying as those with the most connections, after controlling for such variables as age, gender, and health status.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced.

In one careful prospective study, the parents of all the Israeli soldiers who died in the Lebanese war were followed for ten years afterward. Loss of a child did not affect mortality rates in the population of grieving parents in general. However, significantly higher mortality rates occurred among parents who were already widowed or divorced. In other words, this stressor is associated with increased mortality in the subset of parents with the added risk factor of minimal social support.

In searching for a link between stress and increased risk of cancer, it may not be surprising to find that women who have spent long periods (decades in these studies) working night shifts have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, the most plausible explanation here has nothing to do with stress. Instead, a shifted day/night schedule dramatically decreases the level of a light-responsive hormone called melatonin, and depletion of this hormone greatly increases the risk of a number of types of cancer, including breast cancer.

Love, Medicine and Miracles.

As the book unfolds, you note that it is a strange world that Siegel inhabits. When operating on anesthetized patients, “I also do not hesitate to ask the [anesthetized] patient not to bleed if circumstances call for it,” he asserts. In his world, deceased patients come back as birds, there are unnamed countries in which individuals consistently live for a century, and best of all, people who have the right spirituality not only successfully fight cancer but can drive cars that consistently break down for other people.

“I feel that all disease is ultimately related to a lack of love”.

Obviously, a theme of this book is just how many things can go wrong in the body because of stress and how important it is for everyone to recognize this.

Now, like an aging Cretaceous dinosaur, I watch these new mammals proliferating.

“how big is a normal thymus?”.

Perhaps the best moral is that when doing science (or perhaps when doing anything at all in a society as judgmental as our own), be very careful and very certain before pronouncing something to be the norm—because at that instant, you have made it supremely difficult to ever again look objectively at an exception to that supposed norm.

However, it turns out that while Yossarian merely does not believe in the existence of a God and is rather angry about the whole concept, the God that she does not believe in is one who is good and warm and loving, and thus she is offended by the.

“How much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?” “Pain?” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. “Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is a warning to us of bodily dangers.” “And who created the dangers?” Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. “Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! Why couldn’t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of his celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person’s forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn’t He?” “People would certainly look silly walking around with red neon tubes in the middle of their foreheads.” “They certainly look beautiful now writhing in agony or stupefied with morphine, don’t they?” Unfortunately, we lack neon lights in the middle of our foreheads, and in the absence of such innocuous signs, we probably do need pain perception. Pain can hurt like hell, but it can inform us that we are sitting too close to the fire, or that we should never again eat the novel item that just gave us food poisoning. It effectively discourages us from trying to walk on an injured limb that is better left immobilized until it heals. And in our westernized lives, it is often a good signal that we had better see a doctor before it is too late. People who congenitally lack the ability to feel pain (a condition known as pain asymbolia) are a mess; because they can’t feel pain when they step down with too much force, their feet may ulcerate, their knee joints may disintegrate, and their long bones may crack; they burn themselves unawares; in some cases, they even lose a toe without knowing it. Pain is useful to the extent that it motivates us to modify our behaviors in order to reduce whatever insult is causing the pain, because invariably that insult is damaging our tissues. Pain is useless and debilitating, however, when it is telling us that there is something dreadfully wrong that we can do nothing about. We must praise the fact that we have evolved a physiological system that lets us know when our stomachs are empty. Yet at the same time we must deeply rue our evolving physiological system that can wrack a terminal cancer patient with unrelenting pain. Pain, until we get the lights on our foreheads, will remain a necessary but highly problematic part of our natural physiology. What is surprising is how malleable pain signals are—how readily the intensity of a pain signal is changed by the sensations, feelings, and thoughts that coincide with the pain. One example of this modulation, the blunting of pain perception during some circumstances of stress, is the subject of this chapter.   The Basics of Pain Perception   The sensation of pain originates in receptors located throughout our body. Some are deep within the body, telling us about muscle aches, fluid-filled, swollen joints, or damage to organs. Or even something as mundane as a distended bladder. Others, in our skin, can tell us that we have been cut, burned, abraded, poked, or compressed.* Often, these skin receptors respond to the signal of local tissue damage. Cut yourself with a paring knife, and you will slice open various cells of microscopic size that then spill out their proverbial guts; and, typically, within this cellular soup now flooding out of the area of injury is a variety of chemical messengers.

It turned out that patients who had views of trees from their windows requested significantly less pain medication than those who looked out on blank walls.

Half your body is burned and your ankle’s sprained, and you’re trying to carry a loved one out of some inferno—that’s when stress-induced analgesia is going to dominate. Discover.

Here’s an example that will finally make reading this book worth your while—how to make neurobiology work to your competitive advantage at sports. You’re playing tennis against someone who is beating the pants off of you. Wait until your adversary has pulled off some amazing backhand, then offer a warm smile and say, “You are a fabulous tennis player. I mean it; you’re terrific. Look at that shot you just made. How did you do that? When you do a backhand like that, do you hold your thumb this way or that, and what about your other fingers? And how about your butt, do you scrunch up the left side of it and put your weight on your right toes, or the other way around?” Do it right, and the next time that shot is called for, your opponent/victim will make the mistake of thinking about it explicitly, and the stroke won’t be anywhere near as effective. As Yogi Berra once said, “You can’t think and hit at the same time.” Imagine descending a flight of stairs in an explicit manner, something you haven’t done since you were two years old—okay, bend my left knee and roll the weight of my toes forward while shifting my right hip up slightly—and down you go down the stairs.

As a result, the study of “adult neurogenesis” is now, arguably, the hottest topic in neuroscience.

Woody Allen once said, “My brain is my second-favorite organ.” My guess is that most of us would rank our brains even higher up on a list.

“We can’t do this, we’re going to die, I’m serious, people DIE from lack of sleep, it’s not possible to do this, it’s physiologically proven, we’re all going to DIE.”.

Not getting enough sleep is a stressor; being stressed makes it harder to sleep. Yup, we’ve got a dread vicious cycle on our hands.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional.

That’s why dreams are dreamlike—illogical, nonsequential, hyperemotional. You breathe underwater, fly in the air, communicate telepathically; you announce your love to strangers, invent languages, rule kingdoms, star in Busby Berkeley musicals.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain.

Others speculate that sleep is for decreasing brain temperature, letting it cool off from all that daytime brainstorming, or for detoxifying the brain. Weirdly, another major reason to sleep is to dream. If you skip a night’s sleep, when you finally get to sleep the next night, you have more REM sleep than normal, suggesting that you’ve built up a real deficit of dreaming.

Both slow wave and REM sleep also seem to play roles in the formation of new memories, the consolidation of information from the previous day, even information that became less accessible to you while awake over the course of the day. One type of evidence supporting this is the fact that if you teach an animal some task and disrupt its sleep that night, the new information isn’t consolidated.

Being exposed to lots of new information during the day is associated with more REM sleep that night.

For example, lots of REM sleep during the night predicts better consolidation of emotional information from the day before, while lots of stage 2 sleep predicts better consolidation of a motor task, and a combination of lots of REM and slow wave sleep predicts better retention of perceptual information.

In 1910, the average American slept nine hours a night, disturbed only by the occasional Model T backfiring. We now average 7.5 and declining. When there’s the lure of 24-hour-a-day fun, activities, and entertainment or, for the workaholic, the knowledge that somewhere, in some time zone, someone else is working while you indulge yourself in sleep, that pull of “just a few more minutes,” of pushing yourself, becomes irresistible. And damaging.

“The lion and the lamb shall lie down together. But the lamb won’t get much sleep.”).

Just when we finally grow up and learn to like ourselves and to love and play, the shadows lengthen. There is so little time.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves.

While the size of social networks shrink with age, the quality of the relationships improves. There are types of cognitive skills that improve in old age (these are related to social intelligence and to making good strategic use of facts, rather than merely remembering them easily).

If you want to degenerate very fast, secrete a ton of glucocorticoids.

Live—if you squander a lot of your heartbeats being nervous about blind dates when you’re sixteen, there would be that much less metabolic reserve available to you at eighty.

But this time, when the painful stimulus occurs, the organism under study can reach out for its mommy and cry in her arms. Under these circumstances, this organism shows less of a stress-response.

We humans also deal better with stressors when we have outlets for frustration—punch a wall, take a run, find solace in a hobby. We are even cerebral enough to imagine those outlets and derive some relief: consider the prisoner of war who spends hours imagining a golf game in tremendous detail. I have a friend who passed a prolonged and very stressful illness lying in bed with a mechanical pencil and a notepad, drawing topographic maps of imaginary mountain ranges and taking hikes through them.

It’s a real primate specialty as well. A male baboon loses a fight. Frustrated, he spins around and attacks a subordinate male who was minding his own business.

“He’s one of those guys who doesn’t get ulcers, he gives them.”.

Social support networks—it helps to have a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, an ear to listen to you, someone to cradle you and to tell you it will be okay.

In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular stress-response.

Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher glucocorticoid levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting cortisol levels.

As noted in chapter 8, people with spouses or close friends have longer life expectancies.

If you are a member of an ethnic minority, the fewer members there are of your group in your neighborhood, the higher your risks of mental illness, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide..

The instant the second burst of drilling ends, down goes blood pressure. By being given news about the stressor to come, you are also implicitly being comforted by now knowing what stressors are not coming.

It’s that the temperature in the tropics is 20 degrees colder than anticipated.

Among other reasons, we wish to optimize our coping strategies when we request the most devastating piece of medical information any of us will ever face: “How much time do I have left?”.

Thus, the exercise of control is not critical; rather, it is the belief that you have it.

An everyday example: airplanes are safer than cars, yet more of us are phobic about flying. Why? Because your average driver believes that he is a better-than-average driver, thus more in control. In an airplane, we have no control at all. My wife and I tease each other on plane flights, exchanging control: “Okay, you rest for a while, I’ll take over concentrating on keeping the pilot from having a stroke.”.

Amazingly, the same is seen in a rat—let a rat run voluntarily in a running wheel, and it makes it feel great. Force a rat to do the same amount of exercise and it gets a massive stress-response.

Endless studies have shown that the link between occupational stress and increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is anchored in the killer combination of high demand and low control—you have to work hard, a lot is expected of you, and you have minimal control over the process.

The control element is more powerful than the demand one—low demand and low control is more damaging to one’s health than high demand and high control.

For example, it was only in recent years that orchestra unions won the right for regularly scheduled bathroom breaks during rehearsals, instead of having to wait until the conductor cared to note how squirmy the reed players had become.*.

Being subject to a random act of kindness.

An inappropriate sense of control in the face of awful events can make us feel terrible. Some of our most compassionate words to people experiencing tragedy involve minimizing their perceived sense of control. “It’s not your fault, no one could have stopped in time; she just darted out from between the cars.”.

“If they’d only made the effort to assimilate, they wouldn’t have these problems” (minorities have the power to prevent their persecution).

People with a strong internal locus of control (in other words, people who think they are the masters of their own ship—that what goes on around them reflects their actions) have far greater stress-responses than do those with external loci when confronted with something uncontrollable.

In the next two chapters we will consider psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and personality disorders, in which there’s a bad match between how stressful the real world is and how stressful the person perceives it to be.

Progeria, idiot savants with autism, cannibals with kuru.

Its incidence has been steadily increasing for decades—by the year 2020, depression is projected to be the second leading cause of medical disability on earth.

The defining feature of a major depression is loss of pleasure. If I had to define a major depression in a single sentence, I would describe it as a “genetic/neurochemical disorder requiring a strong environmental trigger whose characteristic manifestation is an inability to appreciate sunsets.”.

None of us will live forever, and on occasion we actually believe it; our days are filled with disappointments, failures, unrequited loves.

This trait is called anhedonia: hedonism is “the pursuit of pleasure,” anhedonia is “the inability to feel pleasure” (also often called dysphoria—I’ll be using the terms interchangeably).

There can be complex layers of these feelings: not just obsessive guilt, for example, about something that has contributed to the depression, but obsessive guilt about the depression itself—what it has done to the sufferer’s family, the guilt of not being able to overcome depression, a life lived but once and wasted amid this disease. Small wonder that, worldwide, depression accounts for 800,000 suicides per year.

An additional vegetative symptom is extremely relevant to this chapter, namely that major depressives often experience elevated levels of glucocorticoids.

In one variant, unipolar depression, the sufferer fluctuates from feeling extremely depressed to feeling reasonably normal.

In another form, the person fluctuates between deep depression and wild, disorganized hyperactivity. This is called bipolar depression or, more familiarly, manic depression.

Or we could describe someone as being in a manic state when he is buoyed by some unexpected good news—talking quickly, laughing, gesticulating.

The best evidence suggests that depression involves abnormal levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.

In one part of the body (the heart, for example), norepinephrine is a messenger concerning arousal and the Four F’s, while in a different part of the nervous system, norepinephrine seems to have something to do with the symptoms of depression.

The best evidence is that most of the drugs that lessen depression increase the amount of signaling by these neurotransmitters.

As mammals, we have large limbic systems; lizards have relatively tiny limbic systems—they are not noted for the complexity of their emotional lives.

Above that is the cortex. Everyone in the animal kingdom has some, but it is a real primate specialty. The cortex does abstract cognition, invents philosophy, remembers where your car keys are. The stuff of the previous chapter.

On an incredibly simplistic level, you can think of depression as occurring when your cortex thinks an abstract negative thought and manages to convince the rest of the brain that this is as real as a physical stressor.

Thus, an astonishingly crude prediction: cut the connections between the cortex and the rest of a depressive’s brain, and the cortex will no longer be able to get the rest of the brain depressed.

And the emotions that the ACC is involved in seem to be negative ones. Induce a positive state in someone by showing something amusing, and ACC metabolism decreases. In contrast, if you electrically stimulate the ACC in people, they feel a shapeless sense of fear and foreboding.

Specifically, activation of the left PFC is associated with positive moods, and activation of the right PFC, with negative.

Thus, not surprisingly, in depressives, there is decreased left PFC activity and elevated activity in the right PFC.

To begin, people who secrete too little thyroid hormone can develop major depressions and, when depressed, can be atypically resistant to antidepressant drugs working.

When something upsetting happens, women are more likely to ruminate over it—think about it or want to talk about it with someone else. And men, terrible communicators that they so often are, are more likely to want to think about anything but the problem, or even better, go and do something—exercise, use power tools, get drunk, start a war. A ruminative tendency, the cognitive psychologists argue, makes you more likely to become depressed.

Share every single gene with someone who is depressive and you still have a 50 percent chance of not having the disease.

Genes are rarely about inevitability, especially when it comes to humans, the brain, or behavior. They’re about vulnerability, propensities, tendencies.

But the key thing is that having version X of this gene Z doesn’t guarantee you get depression, it just increases your risk. And, in fact, knowing nothing more about someone than which version of gene Z she has doesn’t increase your odds of predicting whether she gets depressed. Version X increases depression risk only when coupled with a history of repeated major stressors.

In the case of a major melancholic depression, you have become obsessed with the ambivalence—the simultaneity, the irreconcilable nature of the intense love alongside the intense hatred.

Melancholia—a major depression—Freud theorized, is the internal conflict generated by this ambivalence.

“If only I had said the things I needed to, if only we could have worked things out”—for all of time, you have lost the chance to purge yourself of the ambivalence. For the rest of your life, you will be reaching for the door to let you into a place of pure, unsullied love, and you can never reach that door.

“Face it. We suffer from learned cooking helplessness.”.

If a teacher at a critical point of our education, or a loved one at a critical point of our emotional development, frequently exposes us to his or her own specialized uncontrollable stressors, we may grow up with distorted beliefs about what we cannot learn or ways in which we are unlikely to be loved.

Times were good enough that he wasn’t going to starve, and he had reached the realization that there were things in life more important than fighting your way up the hierarchy.

He has a best friend in their mother, Barbara, and never gives a thought to what he’s turned his back on.

We are ecologically buffered and privileged enough to be stressed mainly over social and psychological matters.

Anxiety is about dread and foreboding and your imagination running away with you. Much as with depression, anxiety is rooted in a cognitive distortion. In this case, people prone toward anxiety overestimate risks and the likelihood.

I will attempt to do that reframing below. Instead, they characterized Type-A people as immensely competitive, overachieving, time-pressured, impatient, and hostile. People with that profile, they reported, had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Their work suggested that a persistent sense of insecurity is, in fact, a better predictor of cardiovascular profiles than is hostility, although theirs appears to be a minority view in the field.

In support of that, experimental studies show that the full expression of anger is a powerful stimulant of the cardiovascular system.

By contrast, in the reanalysis of the original Type-A data a particularly powerful predictor of heart disease was not only high degrees of hostility, but also the tendency not to express it when angry.

Run them through the blood and guts, and, with them gripping the arms of their chairs and trying to remain stoic, and still, the sympathetic activation becomes even greater. Repressing the expression of strong emotions appears to exaggerate the intensity of the physiology that goes along with them.

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s.

They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

These are the archetypal people who cross all their t’s and dot all their i’s. They describe themselves as planners who don’t like surprises, who live structured, rule-bound lives—walking to work the same way each day, always wearing the same style of clothes—the sort of people who can tell you what they’re having for lunch two weeks from Wednesday. Not surprisingly, they don’t like ambiguity and strive to set up their world in black and white, filled with good or bad people, behaviors that are permitted or strictly forbidden. They keep a tight lid on their emotions. Stoic, regimented, hardworking, productive, solid folks who never stand out in a crowd (unless you begin to wonder at the unconventional nature of their extreme conventionality).

A lesson of repressive personality types and their invisible burdens is that, sometimes, it can be enormously stressful to construct a world without stressors.

If the context is one in which that special someone is likely to eventually say yes, her running hot and cold is all that’s needed to start you off on a fifty-year courtship.

Glucocorticoids, those hormones which have been discovered at the scene of the crime for virtually all the stress-related pathology we’ve been learning about, those same villainous glucocorticoids…will trigger the release of dopamine from pleasure pathways.

These are the folks who push every envelope. They spend every last dollar in Monopoly, have furtive sex in public places, try out a new, complicated recipe on important dinner guests, answer the ad in Soldier of Fortune. What’s up with them?.

Food for a hungry rat, sex for a horny one, and dopamine levels rise 50 to 100 percent in this pathway. But give the rat some cocaine and there is a THOUSAND-FOLD increase in dopamine release.

If someone always yells at you, you stop listening. If you flood a synapse with a gazillion times more of a neurotransmitter than is usually the case, the recipient neuron has to compensate by becoming less sensitive.

This is the addictive cycle of escalating drug use.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels.

The stranglehold of addiction is when it is no longer the issue of how good the drug feels, but how bad its absence feels. It’s about the motivation to avoid the punishment of not having the drug.

No wonder you feel so awful. Brain-imaging studies of drug users at that stage show that viewing a film of actors pretending to use drugs activates dopamine pathways in the brain more than does watching porn films.

As goes one of the clichés of addiction, there’s really no such thing as an ex-addict—it is simply an addict who is not in the context that triggers use.

The premise of this book is that we humans, especially we westernized humans, have come up with some pretty strange sources of negative emotions—worrying about and being saddened by purely psychological events that are displaced over space and time. But we westernized humans have also come up with some strange sources of positive emotions.

If we were nothing but machines of local homeostatic regulation, as we consume more, we would desire less.

Caveat—when I discuss a way in which stress can make you sick, that is merely shorthand for discussing how stress can make you more likely to get diseases that make you sick.

At the other extreme are the folks anchored in mind-body issues, for whom poor health is about psychological stress, lack of control and efficacy, and so on.

And it has come in the form of criticizing the extremes of both camps: on the one hand, trying to make clear how limiting it is to believe that humans can ever be reduced to a DNA sequence, and on the other, trying to indicate the damaging idiocy of denying the realities of human physiology and disease.

That disease, even the most reductive of diseases, cannot be appreciated without considering the person who is ill.

If we can’t consider disease outside the context of the person who is ill, we also can’t consider it outside the context of the society in which that person has gotten ill, and that person’s place in that society.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,”.

“Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine on a large scale,” he wrote. And, “Physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor.”.

Resources, no matter how plentiful, are rarely divvied up evenly.

You spend hours sweet-talking someone into grooming you, getting rid of those bothersome thorns and nettles and parasites in your hair, and the grooming session can be broken up by someone dominant just for the sheer pleasure of hassling you. Or you could be sitting there, minding your own business, bird-watching, and some high-ranking guy having a bad day decides to make you pay for it by slashing you with his canines.

The answer, overwhelmingly, is that rank emerges first, and drives the distinctive stress profile.

Social subordination equals being chronically stressed equals an overactive stress-response equals more stress-related disease.

Some people always get more of their share of equality than others.

Where people in the community would stop kids from vandalizing a car even if they don’t know whose car it is.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality.

In his writing, he emphasizes that trust requires reciprocity, and reciprocity requires equality. In contrast, hierarchy is about domination, not symmetry and equality.

To figure this out, you need some fancy statistical techniques called path analysis.

One more grim example of how this works. America: enormous wealth, enormous income inequality, high crime, the most heavily armed nation on earth. And markedly low levels of social capital—it is virtually the constitutional right of an American to be mobile and anonymous. Show your independence. Move across the country for any job opportunity. (He lives across the street from his parents? Isn’t that a little, er, stunted?) Get a new accent, get a new culture, get a new name, unlist your phone number, reboot your life. All of which are the antitheses of developing social capital. This helps to explain something subtle about the health-income inequality relationship.

Our American credo is that people are willing to tolerate a society with miserably low levels of social capital, so long as there can be massive income inequality…with the hope that they will soon be sitting at the top of this steep pyramid.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight.

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight. Agriculture allowed for the stockpiling of surplus resources and thus, inevitably, the unequal stockpiling of them—stratification of society and the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think that the punch line of the primate-human difference is that when humans invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low-ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.

Their simple, empowering, liberating message: if manipulating such psychological variables can work in these trying circumstances, it certainly should for the more trivial psychological stressors that fill our daily lives.

It is critical that one not walk away with the conclusion that in order to manage and minimize psychological stressors, the solution is always to have more of a sense of control, more predictability, more outlets, more social affiliation. These principles of stress management work only in certain circumstances. And only for certain types of people with certain types of problems.

Despite the endless ways in which stress can disrupt, we do not all collapse into puddles of stress-related disease and psychiatric dysfunction.

Animals of many different species show some version of giving up on life in the face of something aversive and out of their control.

When it comes to humans who wish to cope with stress and achieve successful aging, you should be sure to pick the right parents’ genes, and the right parents’ socioeconomic status as well.

What if we happen not to be the sort of baboon who looks at the bright side, the person who holds on to hope when others become hopeless, the parent of the child with cancer who somehow psychologically manages the unmanageable?.

As the most obvious example, physical conditioning brought about by regular exercise will lower blood pressure and resting heart rate and increase lung capacity, just to mention a few of its effects.

Among Type-A people, psychotherapy can change not only behaviors but also cholesterol profiles, risk of heart attack, and risk of dying, independent of changes in diet or other physiological regulators of cholesterol. As another example, the pain and stressfulness of childbirth can be modulated by relaxation techniques such as Lamaze.

Exercise is great to counter stress for a number of reasons. First, it decreases your risk of various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and therefore decreases the opportunity for stress to worsen those diseases.

For that reason, I think it would be helpful to put my cards on the table before tackling this subject. I had a highly orthodox religious upbringing and believed devoutly. Except that now I am an atheist, have no room in my life for spirituality of any kind, and believe that religion is phenomenally damaging. Except that I wish I could be religious. Except that it makes no sense to me and I’m baffled by people who believe. Except that I’m also moved by them. So I’m confused. On to the science.

For example, an endless source of tension in heterosexual relationships is that women, on average, tend toward emotion- or relationship-based coping styles, whereas men tend toward problem-solving approaches.

As an idiotic example, suppose there’s a big exam looming. One version of coping with it is to study; another is to reframe the meaning of a bad grade (“There’s more to life than this class, I’m still a good person who is good at other things…”). Obviously before the exam, the stress-reduction-by-studying strategy should dominate, while you should hold off on the stress-reduction-by-reframing approach until after the exam.

80 percent of the stress reduction is accomplished with the first 20 percent of effort. What.

For example, clinically depressed people feel significantly better simply by scheduling a first appointment to see a therapist—it means they’ve recognized there’s a problem, it means they’ve fought their way up through the psychomotor quagmire to actually do something, it means they’ve turned a corner.
