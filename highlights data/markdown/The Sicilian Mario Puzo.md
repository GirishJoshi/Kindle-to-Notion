Though he was smiling, it was a face that made you dream of murder.

Don Croce immediately led him into the garden, for like all Sicilians he ate his meals out of doors when he could.

He drove carefully and slowly, as men do who have learned to drive motor vehicles late in life.

Michael thought, What the hell was the man saying? Why couldn't he get a straight answer from any of them? Because this was Sicily, he thought. Sicilians had a horror of truth. Tyrants and Inquisitors had tortured them for the truth over thousands of years. The government in Rome with its legal forms demanded the truth. The priest in the confessional box commanded the truth under pain of everlasting hell. But truth was a source of power, a lever of control, why should anyone give it away?.

He aims a gun forward and slaughters his friend by his side.

"Tell the truth, all Sicilians prefer smelling the shit of their villages to the best perfumes in Paris. What am I doing here? I could have escaped to Brazil like some others. Ah, we love where we are born, we Sicilians, but Sicily does not love us.".

He always had such grand ideas, he always talked of justice. A true Sicilian talks of bread.".

In his first days as an outlaw he looked down from the mountains but could not see. And I looked up and could not see. But we felt each other's presence, each other's love.

The girl could go, she was bound only by love, not by blood.

There were a hundred children for each olive that fell to the ground, and these children were like locusts.

"What a nuisance life is. I have work to do on my land and yet when my neighbor asked me to do this little favor, how could I refuse? My father knew his father, my grandfather his grandfather. And it is my nature, perhaps my misfortune that I will do anything a friend asks me to do. After all, are we not Christians together?".

In the street Turi Guiliano felt his moodiness fade with the sheer beauty of the day. The golden sun was glorious, the smell of lemon and olive trees filled the air. He loved the town of Montelepre, its crooked streets, the stone houses with their balconies filled with those gaudy flowers that grew in Sicily without the slightest encouragement.

"If we could all live like donkeys, eh, what a life.".

"These are hard times," he said to Guiliano. "The promised reward of heaven is too far away, men must have some pleasure now. God will forgive them.".

Don Croce had never believed in the divine right of kings, indeed he asserted that no reasonable human being had ever believed in it except when the alternative was being torn apart by four wild horses.

Don Croce indignantly boasted that he had never used torture of any kind. Simple murder sufficed.

For Don Croce believed that greediness was the greatest of all human failings, and he shared his profits freely. He was more.

It was bad enough to be an outlaw, but to be a revolutionary was more dangerous. "That's.

When did the dreams of heroes begin, if not when sitting in a lonely glen, talking to dear friends.

And his godson would be another of these heroes, not understanding that for Sicily to change, there would have to be a moral volcano that would incinerate the land.

A belief in one's own virtue is far more dangerous than a belief in one's cunning.

Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta.

They were best friends and they were the center of each other's universe. Their friendship revolved around the fact that they were there, not only when they needed each other, but also when they did not.

Man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

"A man who does not know the history of mankind for the last two thousand years is a man living in the dark.".

For say what you would of a Sicilian: that they were born criminals, that they murdered as easily as a woman picks flowers, that they were as cunningly treacherous as Turks, that they were socially three hundred years behind the times; yet no one could dispute that Sicilians loved, no, they idolized children.

Even a Member of Parliament was called Honorable to his face though everyone knew these rascals were greater thieves than anyone.

Guiliano laughed and the Prince was charmed by that youthful laugh, the boyish handsomeness of his face. But with Guiliano's answer the charm vanished. "Your government has set a price of ten million lire on my head. It would be an insult to Your Lordship if the ransom were not ten times as high." The Prince was stunned then said ironically, "I hope my family thinks as highly of me as you do.".

"Do you really care so much for what you wear on the outside of your skin?".

And this was not uncommon in Italy. The lower classes were treated cruelly only when they fought for their economic rights.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me. And.

You are one of the few people in the world who makes living worthwhile for me.

There could not therefore be any doubt that they would become lovers, for no Sicilian believed that any male and female alone together, no matter what difference in age, could refrain.

"I'll take you to Guiliano, but keep your lupare.

But not the secrets Guiliano ordered him not to tell.

Writing a poem is easy
Writing a song is hard,
With song you need music,
And somone might have to dance.

Making a friend is easy,
Being a friend is hard,
For making you only need meeting,
For being you need to keep them in heart, even when apart.

The Fiat skirted the.

In a corner of the garden, beneath a lemon tree, was an oval wooden table with rustic wooden chairs around.

'Don't reproach your two beautiful children who will be the pleasure and comfort of your old age. The money I have given them is far greater than you have lost. And know this: From today on, you and your children are under the protection of GUILIANO.'.

"But what made me love him was the pleasure he received in doing a good deed. He was really delighted to help someone else. That never changed. I always saw the same pleasure, as if he gained more from the giving than they did from the taking. That is why the people of Sicily love him.".

Pisciotta was a man who could never trust anyone completely and was therefore a man who by definition could not be trusted by anyone completely.

Waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as.

"Let's talk Sicilian together," the Don said gravely. "When we are children, when we are young, it is natural to love our friends, to be generous to them, to forgive their faults. Each day is fresh, we look forward to the future with pleasure and without fear. The world itself is not so dangerous; it is a happy time. But as we grow old and have to earn our bread, friendship does not endure so easily. We must always be on our guard. Our elders no longer look after us, we are no longer content with those simple pleasures of children. Pride grows in us – we wish to become great or powerful or rich, or simply to guard ourself against misfortune. I know how much you love Turi Guiliano, but now you must ask yourself, what is the price of this love? And after all these years does it still exist or is it just the memory that exists?" He waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as white. For Pisciotta's face had gone very pale.

"You warned me about his attack on my hotel. That was an act of friendship?".

"That is Sicily," the Don said. "There is always treachery within treachery.".

It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

For the first time the Don showed annoyance. He poured himself another glass of anisette and drank it down. He pointed a finger at his son. "You wanted to learn," he said. "Now listen to me. A man's first duty is to keep himself alive. Then comes what everyone calls honor. This dishonor, as you call it, I willingly take upon myself. I did it to save your life as you once took on dishonor to save mine. You would never have left Sicily alive without Don Croce's protection. So be it. Do you want to be a hero like Guiliano, a legend? And dead? I love him as the son of my dear friends, but I do not envy him his fame. You are alive and he is dead. Always remember that and live your life not to be a hero but to remain alive. With time, heroes seem a little foolish." Michael sighed. "Guiliano had no choice," he said. "We are more fortunate," the Don said. It was the first lesson Michael received from his father and the one he learned best. It was to color his future life, persuade him to make terrible decisions he could never have dreamed of making before. It changed his perception of honor and his awe of heroism. It helped him to survive, but it made him unhappy. For despite the fact that his father did not envy Guiliano, Michael did.

When they are free they abuse their health – they smoke to excess, they drink to drunkenness, they fornicate to exhaustion. They don't sleep enough or get enough exercise. Then when they have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, they do push-ups, they spurn tobacco, they watch their diet and are moderate in all things.".

The piece of paper Hector Adonis had slipped inside Aspanu's shirt read so die all who betray guiliano.

Ah, Sicily, Sicily, he thought, you destroy your best and bring them to dust. Children more beautiful than the angels spring from your earth and turn into demons. The evil flourish in this soil like the bamboo and the prickly pear. And yet why was Don Croce here to lay flowers at Guiliano's grave?.

By remaining faithful, Pisciotta would have been forgotten, Guiliano would fill the legend alone. But by committing his great crime, he would stand alongside his beloved Turi forever.

Pisciotta would be buried in this same cemetery. The two of them would gaze forever at their cherished mountains, those same mountains that held the skeleton of Hannibal's elephant, that once echoed with the great blasts of Roland's horn when he died fighting the Saracens. Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta had died young, but they would live, if not forever, certainly longer than Don Croce or himself, Professor Hector Adonis.
