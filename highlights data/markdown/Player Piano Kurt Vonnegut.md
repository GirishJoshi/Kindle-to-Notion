Bud, who was manager of the petroleum terminal in Ilium, worked only when shipments came or went by barge or pipeline, and he spent most of his time between these crises—as now—filling Katharine’s ears with the euphoria of his Georgia sweet talk.

Five of the Shah’s expressions. “Khabu” meant “where?” “Siki” meant “what?” “Akka sahn” meant “why?” “Brahous brahouna, houna saki” was a combination of blessing and thanks, and Sumklish was the sacred Kolhouri drink which Khashdrahr carried in a hip flask for the Shah.

Each had before him a headless beer in a glass whose rim was opaqued by hours of slow, thoughtful sipping.

Paul envied Finnerty’s mind, for Finnerty could be anything he wanted to be, and be brilliant at it. Whatever the times might have called for, Finnerty would have been among the best. If this had been the age of music, Finnerty would have been, and in fact was, a top-flight pianist—or he might have been an architect or physician or writer. With inhuman intuition, Finnerty could sense the basic principles and motives of almost any human work, not just engineering.

Paul could have been only what he was, he thought. As he filled his glass again, he supposed that he could only have come to this moment, this living room, into the presence of Anita.

Khashdrahr shrugged and looked questioningly at Halyard. “Shah says, if these not slaves, how you get them to do what they do?” “Patriotism,” said General of the Armies Bromley sternly. “Patriotism, damn it.” “Love of country,” said Halyard. Khashdrahr told the Shah, and the Shah nodded slightly, but his look of puzzlement did not disappear. “Sidi ba—” he said tentatively.

Eternal vigilance was the price of efficiency.

“A psychiatrist could help. There’s a good man in Albany.” Finnerty shook his head. “He’d pull me back into the center, and I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can’t see from the center.”.

“Big, undreamed-of things—the people on the edge see them first.”.

He used words to describe his feelings that Paul could never bring himself to use when speaking of a friend: love, affection, and other words generally consigned to young and inexperienced lovers. It wasn’t homosexual; it was an archaic expression of friendship by an undisciplined man in an age when most men seemed in mortal fear of being mistaken for pansies for even a split second.

“But you find out quick enough that old friends are old friends, and nothing more—no wiser, no more help than anyone else. Well, what the hell, that doesn’t mean I’m not damned pleased to see you again.”.

“One more thing: I want to be sure you understand that men really do worry about what there is for their sons to live for; and some sons do hang themselves.”.

“Sometimes I think I’d like to be—if only in self-defense. Also, it’d be a swell way to get rich. Trouble is, I can be sold or unsold on anything too easily. I enjoy being talked into something. Pretty shaky outlook for a Messiah. Besides, who ever heard of a short, fat, middle-aged Messiah with bad eyesight? And I haven’t got that common touch. Frankly, the masses give me a pain in the tail, and I guess I show it.” He made clucking sounds with his tongue. “I’m going to get myself a uniform, so I’ll know what I think and stand for.”.

I do know that it’s far easier to ask questions than to answer them.

“What else could we possibly give the people that they haven’t got?” “There! You made my point for me. You said, what else could we give them, as though everything in the world were ours to give or withhold.”.

Could be softened with a smile, but not saboteur.

“Fare thee well, for I must leave you, Please don’t let this parting grieve you; Fare thee well, the time has come for us to say goodbye. Adieu, adieu, kind friends, adieu, yes, adieu!.

And my husband says somebody’s just got to be maladjusted; that somebody’s got to be uncomfortable enough to wonder where people are, where they’re going, and why they’re going there. That was the trouble with his book. It raised those questions, and was rejected. So he was ordered into public-relations duty.”.

“For richer, for poorer, in sickness as in health,” said Paul. “Remember that Anita? Do you remember?” “You’re still rich, and you’re not sick.” She looked at him with passing concern. “You’re not sick, are you?” “At heart.” “You’ll get used to it. I did.” “I’m sorry, Anita—I didn’t know it had been that bad. I see now that it probably was.”.

“Jimmy, I.Q. isn’t everything. Some of the unhappiest people in this world are the smartest ones.”.

“Everybody works at something. Getting out of bed’s work! Getting food off your plate and into your mouth’s work! But there’s two kinds of work, kid, work and hard work. If you want to stand out, have something to sell, you got to do hard work. Pick out something impossible and do it, or be a bum the rest of your life. Sure, everybody worked in George Washington’s time, but George Washington worked hard. Everybody worked in Shakespeare’s time, but Shakespeare worked hard. I’m who I am because I work hard.”.

Replacement is not necessarily bad, but to do it without regard for the wishes of men is lawlessness.

“Men, by their nature, seemingly, cannot be happy unless engaged in enterprises that make them feel useful. They must, therefore, be returned to participation in such enterprises. “I hold, and the members of the Ghost Shirt Society hold: “That there must be virtue in imperfection, for Man is imperfect, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in frailty, for Man is frail, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in inefficiency, for Man is inefficient, and Man is a creation of God. “That there must be virtue in brilliance followed by stupidity, for Man is alternately brilliant and stupid, and Man is a creation of God. “You perhaps disagree with the antique and vain notion of Man’s being a creation of God. “But I find it a far more defensible belief than the one implicit in intemperate faith in lawless technological progress—namely, that man is on earth to create more durable and efficient images of himself, and, hence, to eliminate any justification at all for his own continued existence. “Faithfully yours, “Doctor Paul Proteus.”.

“Every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity,”.

“And read books instead of watching television,”.
