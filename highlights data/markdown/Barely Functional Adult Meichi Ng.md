There’s only a small sliver of time to follow through on your fun, impractical notions before that pesky voice of reason reels you out of it—so you gotta act fast.

But instead of that license being proof of my competence as a driver, all it proves is that it’s much too easy to get a license.

I’ve never held any of the core competencies one would want of a driver—like the ability to focus—so as a courtesy to the world, I do not drive.

When we arrived at the pet store, my friend asked me why I wasn’t getting a dog or a cat. People always assume it’s one or the other when you declare your intention of acquiring a pet. It really throws off their worldview when your pet species goes beyond the fourth letter of the alphabet.

In fairness, I love both cats and dogs. But it was important for me to get a pet that didn’t have abandonment issues. I didn’t want a pet that would be sad whenever I left for work; I have enough guilt in my life as is. So instead, I focused my search on a pet companion that would love me—but at a comfortable distance. The kind of emotionally independent love that is there when you need it, but won’t swallow you whole. Try not to psychoanalyze that.

It’s easy to love things that are beautiful, but Bobo was far from beautiful. While the other fish in his tank had shimmering, buttercup-yellow scales that effortlessly glistened with every movement in the water, Bobo’s coat was more of a dull mustard color. Even as he anxiously darted from one corner of the tank to the other, his scales shimmered half-heartedly, as though they had long given up on the facade of beauty.

There is something to be said about the people who are able to give us the exact kind of junk we love.

Not the expensive gifts, because anyone can give those, but the inexpensive ones, the crap no one would steal if we left it out in our cars, the worthless but priceless totems that remind us we are seen.

It’s the kind of high you could spend your life chasing.

I spent the years that followed feeling silly that someone was able to make such a lasting impact on my life in such a short period of time, but I’ve since learned that time and impact are disturbingly uncorrelated when it comes to the people we love.

But grief presents itself as different monsters for different people.

People say things they don’t mean when they’re hurt,.

When our songs came on the radio, I would find Gum in my ears.

Trying to get over someone you can’t get over is like seeing a bridge and knowing full well that the only thing that separates you from eternal happiness is that one bridge.

My understanding of “moving on” has shifted substantially over the years. I no longer consider moving on to be synonymous with not caring. I think it’s more complex than that. I think moving on is about allowing ourselves to remember the good and the bad, to distinguish the past from the present, and to accept who we are, who we were, and everyone we met along the way.

I should have negotiated my salary, but my parents had always taught me to be thankful instead of asking for more.

The reasonable thing to do would have been to just accept it—to accept what most sensible adults have come to accept—that work is a pointless sacrifice to the gods in order to afford the basic necessities and niceties of life.

My tears are to be saved for sad movies—not sad managers,.

But I think there’s value in knowing when to call it, in knowing when to get up and leave, in knowing when we’re done—even if it means having to walk out into the unknown to start all over again.

“Sometimes I feel like . . . nothing I do is ever good enough or will ever be good enough,” I said, opening yet another jar. “What makes you think that?” my therapist asked. “Well, I look back at something I made three years ago and I feel like it’s total garbage. Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .”.

Which I know is the definition of ‘growth’ or whatever.” I did the air quotes here and rolled my eyes before continuing, “but then I look at something I made last month and I still think it’s garbage! So what if . . .” I paused briefly here before resuming in a low and conspiratorial whisper, “what if . . . everything I do is always and forever going to be garbage?” I gave my therapist a piercing look, as if daring her to find fallacy in my airtight argument. My therapist simply returned a knowing smile. “And what would it mean to you if everything you do is garbage?” she asked. “Well it would mean that I’m gar . . .” I stopped short of finishing that sentence, but we both knew what I was about to say. I turned away to look out one of the windows before continuing. “I guess . . . one day, I’d just like to look at something I made and be proud of it . . . is all,” I said, hoping to end on a lighter note. My therapist gave me a sympathetic smile and a meaningful look. I hated how it actually made me feel a tiny bit better.

The sky can keep its lousy wishes, I thought. Surely, a shooting star wasn’t that much better than a regular star, and there were plenty of regular stars out there. I decided right then and there that if patience was a virtue, then it would have to be a virtue I lived without.

The kind of mutual best friendships that never needed further validation.

And who knows how many times you’re allowed to say no before you stop getting invited altogether.

I guess I always held this suspicion that people put on different versions of themselves in a group setting. And until you’ve talked to someone one-on-one, you don’t really know what they’re like under that mask. And.

And sure, enjoying the company of just one friend at a time may be more time-consuming, but isn’t it nice to know someone cares enough about you to spend time with just you? And not only when it’s a bundled deal with other people?.

But then again, I had friends back home. I guess when you take something for granted and it’s suddenly lost—you tend to feel a bit lost in return.

Don’t think anyone really needs friends, but maybe they’re just nice to have.

I wanted friends who could co-own bookstore speakeasies with me—the kind of friends you get from decades of friendship. I wanted this kind of deep, meaningful friendship and I wanted it in ten seconds flat.

When I packed my bags to move to another country, I forgot to pack my friends. I guess I just thought they were something I could easily pick up after I had settled in . . . like laundry detergent or potted plants.

Pretending to be extroverted when you’re introverted is about as fun as shoving your face into a dirty bucket of ice.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself.

With old friends, there’s no censorship. You can speak as you please because you’ve earned the luxury of being yourself. Pointless conversations can go on for hours, but you won’t feel the hours. And if you should say something questionable, they’ll know it’s because you’re having a bad week, and not because you’re a bad person. True friends see the best parts of us, even when we forget those parts ourselves.

If you say something questionable, you become questionable as a person.

True friends know how many siblings you have—that kind of thing is just basic friendship knowledge.

I began to wonder if I would ever come across that friend click again. The kind of friendship where we could share custody of a pet alpaca. And sure, we wouldn’t be able to go on vacation at the same time because someone would (obviously) have to stay and take care of the alpaca, but that’s a sacrifice I’d be willing to make.

I began to remember who I was when I didn’t have to be someone else for other people, and in this version of myself, I met friends who I actually connected with—the kind of friendships that clicked.

Only after I built my perfect home did I realize that I longed for stars not roof on my head. But I guess it was fine, somethings only get inside your head once you have a roof on your head..

In time,.

“Wishing Tree, here I come,” I whispered to myself. It was completely unnecessary to whisper, but that just made it all the more necessary.

Well, technically, they were raising me up, but I was a reluctant passenger on this spaceship to monotony.

Sure, it does take me a lot longer to recover from a night out, and I did find an unverified wrinkle the other day, but I didn’t know that it meant that I was old, I just assumed it meant I was not young.

Trees are majestic beings—nature’s historians who silently safeguard the riddles of our universe.

I guess when you really want something, it’s just easier to assume you won’t get it.

Not getting something you really want is disheartening enough without also having to be consoled by others.

I enlisted the best free labor I had access to—my family.

I don’t fully understand the magic or logic behind it, but sometimes a stranger, with no sense of boundaries, asking you deeply personal questions is exactly what you need to hear in order to rethink your life.

I think we’re allowed to just . . . do whatever it is that we want to do. Whatever it is that makes us happy.

And in trying to figure out what we want to do, in trying to figure out what makes us happy, we’re bound to feel a little lost at times. But maybe this sense of feeling lost is necessary. Maybe feeling lost is what pushes us to keep exploring. It’s the ethereal song that awakens our curiosities and drives us to follow cows, discover hidden coves, and find remnants of good in a world that so often feels too dark and broken.

Maybe feeling lost is just the prerequisite of adventure—the first chapter of any good story.
