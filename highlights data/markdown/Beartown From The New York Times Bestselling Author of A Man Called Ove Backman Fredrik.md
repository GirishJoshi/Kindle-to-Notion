‘Never trust people who don’t have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.’.

He doesn’t want possessions. He just wants to lie in bed one single night without having to count.

Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it.

Maya leans the guitar against the wall and heads towards the bathroom, and when her back is turned she rolls her eyes so far that an X-ray would have confused her pupils with kidneys. ‘And don’t you roll your eyes at me. I can see you doing it even if I can’t see you doing it,’ her mum snarls. ‘Speculation and hearsay,’ her daughter mutters. ‘I’ve told you, people only say that on television,’ her mum retorts.

‘Okay. Rock-paper-scissors, then.’ Peter shakes his head and tries to stop himself from laughing. ‘What are you? Eight years old?’ Kira raises an eyebrow again. ‘What are you? A coward?’.

Peter’s smile vanishes in an instant as he fixes his eyes on her and clenches his own fist. Kira counts to three out loud, Peter does paper, Kira very blatantly waits half a second longer and then quickly forms her fingers into scissors. Peter yells at her, but by then she’s already snatched up the keys and is heading for the door.

It’s easy for a child to fall in love with something if they’re told that they can be best at it, as long as they want it enough.

Most days you’d think there aren’t any original ideas left, that everything has already been thought, said and written by a whole range of coaches, each one more confident than the last.

We love winners, even though they’re very rarely particularly likeable people. They’re almost always obsessive and selfish and inconsiderate.

We love winners, even though they’re very rarely particularly likeable people. They’re almost always obsessive and selfish and inconsiderate. That doesn’t matter. We forgive them. We like them while they’re winning.

Yet Benji can count the number of times he’s seen Kevin’s parents in the crowd of spectators on the fingers of one hand, and still have two fingers left.

‘Kev, you and a gun anywhere close to my testicles make me nervous. Hockey doesn’t make me nervous.’.

Of all the things in the world you can be envious of your best friend for, this is what Kevin would most like to have: the ability that Benji has always had to not give a shit about anything, and to get away with it. Kevin shakes his head and laughs in resignation.

That’s both a big and a small thing. Knowing that there are people who will never abandon you.

It’s possible that drink made his words sharper. It’s possible that Peter didn’t mean to slam the door quite as hard as he did. It doesn’t matter now. A young man left Beartown in silence and when he came home again it was too late for words. You can’t look a gravestone in the eye and ask its forgiveness.

All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we’re going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.

You never stop being scared of falling from the top, because when you close your eyes you can still feel the pain from each and every step of the way up.

‘The only time I’m not moving forwards is when I’m taking aim.’.

We become what we are told we are. Ana has always been told that she’s wrong.

A simple truth, repeated as often as it is ignored, is that if you tell a child it can do absolutely anything, or that it can’t do anything at all, you will in all likelihood be proven right.

Sune was like Beartown: a firm adherent of the old faith that no tree should grow too tall, naively convinced that hard work was enough. That’s why the club has collapsed at the same rate that unemployment in the town has rocketed. Good workers aren’t enough on their own, someone needs to have big ideas as well. Collectives only work if they’re built around stars.

‘We play for the bear on the front of our jerseys, not the name on the back.’.

All men have different fears that drive them, and Peter’s biggest one is that he isn’t good enough.

That nothing will work without us. That we’re indispensable. But nothing will happen, the rink will remain standing, the club will live on.

Her back has never been straighter. She could run a thousand miles.

Death does strange, incomprehensible things to loving souls.

‘Pull yourself together, there’s others have got it worse.’.

Good intentions don’t count. Twenty years is too long for him to know how to start the conversation now. Should he apologize? What for? How? His eyes roam across the walls again.

He had meant to call Robbie from Canada; he had meant to call him when he moved home. Good intentions don’t count. Twenty years is too long for him to know how to start the conversation now. Should he apologize? What for? How? His eyes roam across the walls again.

‘And what do we want, Ramona? What can the sport give us? We devote our whole lives to it, and what can we hope to get, at best? A few moments … a few victories, a few seconds when we feel bigger than we really are, a few isolated opportunities to imagine that we’re … immortal. And it’s a lie. It really isn’t important.’.

‘The only thing the sport gives us are moments. But what the hell is life, Peter, apart from moments?’.

Being a parent makes you feel like a blanket that’s always too small. No matter how hard you try to cover everyone, there’s always someone who’s freezing.

For years she used to go to bed dreaming of all the things she was going to do when she got older and had more time, and now she sometimes wakes up in despair in the middle of the night because she can no longer remember what those things were.

Kira sees everything, hears everything, and understands almost everything, but says nothing.

‘Success is never a coincidence. Luck can give you money, but never success,’.

His father’s life is all about the quest for perfection, his whole life a chessboard where he isn’t happy unless he’s two moves ahead of everyone else. ‘Success is never a coincidence. Luck can give you money, but never success,’ he often says.

We devote ourselves to sports because they remind us of how small we are just as much as they make us bigger.

A puck, two goals, hearts full of passion.

A puck, two goals, hearts full of passion. Some people say hockey is like religion, but that’s wrong. Hockey is like faith. Religion is something between you and other people; it’s full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith … that’s just between you and God. It’s what you feel in your chest when the referee glides out to the centre circle between two players, when you hear the sticks strike each other and see the black disc fall between them. Then it’s just between you and hockey. Because cherry trees always smell of cherry trees, whereas money smells of nothing.

Their favourite when they were small was: ‘How do you sink a submarine from Hed? You swim down and knock on the door. How do you sink it a second time? You swim down and knock on the door, because then they open it and say, “Oh no, we’re not falling for that again!” ’ When the guys grew older, their favourite was: ‘How do you know you’re at a wedding in Hed? Because everyone’s sitting on the same side of the church.’ Then they got old enough to tell their own jokes, and David used to leave the locker room more and more. Because sometimes the absence of the coach can also unite a team.

Because there’s something wonderful about making the same noise as everyone around him. He’ll feel ashamed of that for ever.

Hockey is just a silly little game. We devote year after year after year to it without ever really hoping to get anything in return. We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meagre and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That’s all. But what the hell else is life made of?.

‘I’m actually more interested in something veiled in smoke than drowned in coke.

They’re fifteen and seventeen years old, and in ten years’ time they’ll remember this evening, when all the others were inside having a party, and they stood out here and became friends.

Everyone talks about what it’s like. All your life you’re told exactly what happens: you get assaulted on a jogging trail, beaten and dragged into an alleyway on a package holiday, drugged in a bar and locked up by unknown adult men in a slum in a big city. Everyone warns you, time and time again, they warn all girls: this can happen! This is how it happens! It’s just that no one tells you it can be like this: with someone you know. Trust.

Her tears are hot when they leave her eyelids but already frozen by the time they fall from her chin.

To do something stupid, all you need is the opportunity. To do something good, all you need is a reason.’.

‘You need to answer when I call!’ Kevin snarls. Benji’s words come slowly, his eyebrows lower threateningly. ‘I think you must be confusing me with Lyt or Bobo. I’m not your slave. I answer when I feel like it.’.

Man who goes out and grabs what he deserves, or one who stands in a corner waiting for someone to give it to him.’.

A man who goes out and grabs what he deserves, or one who stands in a corner waiting for someone to give it to him.’.

In a few years’ time she’ll read an old newspaper article about research showing that the part of the brain that registers physical pain is the same part that registers jealousy.

The job of GM gave him a chance to live on as part of a team, to build something bigger, something that could outlast him.

A great deal is expected of anyone who’s been given a lot.

‘Community is the fact that we work towards the same goal, that we accept our respective roles in order to reach it. Values is the fact that we trust each other. That we love each other.’.

‘Community is the fact that we work towards the same goal, that we accept our respective roles in order to reach it. Values is the fact that we trust.

‘That most people don’t do what we tell them to. They do what we let them get away with.’.

If Peter has learned one thing about human nature during all his years in hockey, it’s that almost everyone regards themselves as a good team player, but that very few indeed understand what that really means. It’s often said that human beings are pack animals, and that thought is so deeply embedded that hardly anyone is prepared to admit that many of us are actually really rubbish at being in groups. That we can’t cooperate, that we’re selfish, or, worst of all, that we’re the sort of people other people just don’t like. So we keep repeating: ‘I’m a good team player.’ Until we believe it ourselves, without actually being prepared to pay the price.

When you can accept the worst aspects of your teammates because you love the collective, that’s when you’re a team player. And it was Sune who taught him that.

Never again do you find friends like the ones you have when you’re fifteen years old.

How much wouldn’t you love someone who could make you do that at a time like this?.

‘Boys, how do you fit four gays on a chair at the same time? You turn it upside down!’.

One of the first things you learn as a leader, whether you choose the position or have it forced upon you, is that leadership is as much about what you don’t say as what you do say.

No social scientist nor any member of a sports team really knows what makes them who they are, the leaders we follow. Only that we don’t hesitate when we see them.

There’s a town in a forest that loves a game. There’s a girl sitting on a bed playing the guitar for her best friend. There’s a young man sitting in a police station trying not to look scared. In a hallway in a hospital, a nurse walks past a lawyer talking loudly into her cell phone. In the stands in an ice rink in a capital city grown men and women are on their feet, shouting that they are the bears from Beartown, along with sponsors and board members who ten years before laughed at a GM who said that one day they would have the best junior team in the country.

Why does anyone care about sport? There’s a woman in the stands who cares because it’s the last thing she’s got that gives her straight answers. She used to be a cross-country skier at the elite level. She sacrificed all her teenage years to skiing long-distance trails, evening after evening with a headlamp and tears streaming from cold and exhaustion, and all the pain and all the losses, and all the things other high school kids were doing with their free time that she could never be part of. But if you were to ask her now if she regrets anything, she’d shake her head. If you were to ask what she would have done if she could go back in time, she’d answer without hesitation: ‘Train harder.’ She can’t explain why she cares about sport, because she’s learned that if you have to ask the question, you simply wouldn’t understand her answer.

You can get almost anything to look normal if you make enough comparisons.

Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn’t through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.

So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that’s easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe – comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy. There are many ways of doing that, but none is easier than taking her name away from.

That child isn’t the bravest, just the least frightened.

There are damn few things in life that are harder than admitting to yourself that you’re a hypocrite.

What is a Pack?.

‘They just want to show that they’d like to be your friends. It’s hard to say, “Can I be your friend?” It’s much easier to say, “Would you like coffee?” This is a town where people … well … I don’t really know how to explain it. A town where people believe in difficult questions and simple answers.’.

There’s an old saying that Sune loves: ‘What do you call it when a man goes out into the forest and other men follow him? Leadership. What do you call it when a man goes out into the forest alone? A walk.’.

The father’s tears trickle down his daughter’s cheeks.

‘What can I do?’ ‘Love me.’ ‘Always, Pumpkin.’ She nods. ‘Can I ask for something, then?’ ‘Anything.’.

‘Can we go out to the garage and play Nirvana?’ ‘Anything except that.’ ‘How can you not like Nirvana?’ ‘I was too old when they made it big.’ ‘How can you be too old for NIRVANA? How old ARE you?’.

They laugh. How powerful that is, the fact that they can still make each other do that.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We have to get the kids away from here,’ he whispers. ‘We can’t protect them. It doesn’t matter where we are, darling, we can’t protect them,’ she replies. ‘We can’t live like that.’ ‘I know.’ Then she kisses him, smiles, and whispers: ‘But you’re not unmanly. You’re very, very, very manly in lots of other ways. For instance, you NEVER admit that you’re wrong.’.

‘Do you think I’m less of a man because I can’t fight?’ he whispers. ‘Do you think I’m less of a woman because I can?’ she asks. ‘We have to get the kids away from here,’ he whispers. ‘We can’t protect them. It doesn’t matter where we are, darling, we can’t protect them,’ she replies. ‘We can’t live like that.’ ‘I know.’ Then she kisses him, smiles, and whispers: ‘But you’re not unmanly. You’re very, very, very manly in lots of other ways. For instance, you NEVER admit that you’re wrong.’ He replies into her hair: ‘And you’re very womanly. The most womanly woman I’ve ever met. For instance, you can NEVER be trusted with rock-paper-scissors.’ They laugh, the pair of them. Even on a morning like this. Because they can, and because they must. They still possess that blessing.

‘One day, Zach, you’ll have more money and influence than all those bastards. And then you’ll do great things. Because you know how much it hurts to have no power. So you won’t hurt them, even though you could. And that will make the world a better place.’.

And they don’t have any female friends, and there are no women’s teams here, so they learn that hockey only belongs to them, and their coaches teach them that girls are a ‘distraction’. So they learn that girls only exist for fucking. She wants to point out how all the old men in this town praise them for ‘fighting’ and ‘not backing down’, but not one single person tells them that when a girl says no, it means NO. And the problem with this town is not only that a boy raped a girl, but that everyone is pretending that he DIDN’T do it. So now all the other boys will think that what he did was okay. Because no one cares. Ana wants to stand on the rooftop and scream: ‘You don’t give a shit about Maya! And you don’t really give a shit about Kevin either! Because they’re not people to you, they’re just objects of value. And his value is far greater than hers!’.

The only way to stop being afraid of the darkness out there is to find a darkness inside yourself that’s bigger.

That didn’t teach me not to spill things. It just made me scared of milk. Remember that.’.

‘When I was little, my dad used to hit me if I spilled my milk, Leo. That didn’t teach me not to spill things. It just made me scared of milk. Remember that.’.

Amat is sitting on Zacharias’s bed when his phone buzzes. A single text. A single word. From Maya. ‘Thanks.’ Amat replies with a single word. ‘Sorry.’ The thanks is for what he has done. The apology is for how long it took him to summon the courage to do it.

There are few words that are harder to explain than ‘loyalty’. It’s always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.

Another morning comes. It always does. Time always moves at the same rate, only feelings have different speeds. Every day can mark a whole lifetime or a single heartbeat, depending on who you spend it with.

‘We have to live, Mum. Please. Don’t let him take my family as well, don’t let him take all our lives. I’m never going to be okay, Mum, this is never going to be properly okay again, I’m never going to stop being afraid of the dark, ever again … but we have to start trying. I don’t want to live in a permanent state of war.’.

That you can want to punch a man in the face but still refuse to let anyone hurt his children.

But this is their way of showing that some people in this town can actually carry more than one thought in their head at the same time. That you can want to punch a man in the face but still refuse to let anyone hurt his children.

So David drives home, puts his hand on his girlfriend’s stomach and pretends he’s crying about the baby. His life will be successful, he will achieve everything he’s ever dreamed of – career and success and titles – he’ll coach unbeatable teams at legendary clubs in several different countries, but he will never let any player in any of them wear number ‘16’. He will always keep hoping that Benji is going to turn up one day and demand his jersey.

But, most of all: my children. Thank you for waiting while I wrote this. NOW we can play Minecraft.
