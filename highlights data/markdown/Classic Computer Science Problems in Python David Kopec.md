It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, trying to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more varied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.

In a world full of halfhearted online tutorials, I think it is important to support the development of books that provide the same author’s voice throughout an extended volume.

If you are one of those programmers who knows Python but does not know CS, this book is for you.

Some say that computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. If that’s the case, then perhaps a programming language.

In any event, the term “classic computer science problems” is used here to mean “programming problems typically taught in an undergraduate computer science curriculum.”.

A reader with zero programming experience will get little out of this book, and a programmer with zero Python experience will almost certainly struggle.

Every code listing in this book makes use of Python type hints, also known as type annotations. These annotations are a relatively new feature for the Python language, and they may look intimidating to Python programmers who have never seen them before. They are used for three reasons:.

The goal is to teach problem-solving techniques from first principles, not to “pip install a solution.”.
