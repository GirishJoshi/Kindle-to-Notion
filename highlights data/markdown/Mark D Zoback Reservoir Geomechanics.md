Once we know an in situ stress ﬁeld in some coordinate system, we can compute stresses in any other.

Because we can choose to describe the state of stress at depth in terms of the principal stresses.

The reason this concept is so important is that because the earth’s surface is in contact with a ﬂuid (either air or water) which cannot support shear tractions, it is a principal stress plane.

We must deﬁne only four parameters to fully describe the state of stress at depth: three principal stress magnitudes, Sv, the vertical stress, corresponding to the weight of the overburden; SHmax, the maximum principal horizontal stress; and Shmin, the minimum principal horizontal stress and one stress orientation, usually taken to be the azimuth of the maximum horizontal compression, SHmax. This obviously helps make stress determination in the crust (as well as description of the in situ stress tensor) a much more tractable problem than it might ﬁrst appear.

Density.

Density logs (upper ﬁgure) can be used to estimate overburden stress at depth (center ﬁgure) or overburden stress gradient (lower ﬁgure). Variability of the density logs, as well as the fact that they are often not obtained.

Extensional (or normal faulting) regime, that.

The orientation of the principal stresses is determined from wellbore observations (Chapter 6), recent geologic indicators and earthquake focal mechanisms.

(which corresponds to Shmin, except in reverse faulting regimes) is obtained from mini-fracs and leak-off tests (Chapter 6).  Pore pressure, Pp, is either measured directly or estimated from geophysical logs or seismic data (Chapter 2).  With these parameters constrained, it is only necessary to constrain SHmax in order to have a reliable estimate of the complete stress tensor as part of a comprehensive geomechanical model of the subsurface. Constraints on the frictional strength of the crust (discussed in Chapter 4) provide general bounds on SHmax (as a function of depth and pore pressure). Having observations of wellbore failures (breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures) allows for much more precise estimates of SHmax. This is discussed for vertical wells in Chapter 7 and for deviated and horizontal wells in Chapter 8. This strategy for in situ stress measurement at depth was ﬁrst employed to estimate the magnitude of the three principal stresses in the Cajon Pass and KTB (Kontinentale Tiefbohrprogramm der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) scientiﬁc drilling projects (Zoback and Healy 1992; Zoback, Apel et al. 1993; Brudy, Zoback et al. 1997) and is referred to as an integrated stress measurement strategy as it utilizes a wide variety of observations (Zoback, Barton et al. 2003). Geomechanical models determined with these techniques appear in the case histories discussed in Chapters 9–12.
