The second practice arose from the Chinese determination that government officials should be scholars first and bureaucrats second. One of the largest empires in the history of the world was administered by a small group of men who, prior to their first assignment, had not had the slightest training in administration, and who knew more about the poetry of a thousand years before than they did about tax law.

‘All things are like spring dreams, passing with no trace.’.

Criticism of my writing will be like the shining of a bright light into a dirty mirror.
