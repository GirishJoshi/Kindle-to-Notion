Society began to aspire.

The year was 1577, and the Mogul emperors were in the process of uniting India. The domain spread twelve hundred miles along the Tropic of Cancer, from the eerie white salt flats of the Rann of Kutch on the shores of the Arabian Sea, to the verdant delta of the holy river Ganges in Bengal; and from the snowy crags of Kabul to the lush teak forests of the Vindhyan foothills. The 100 million people who lived under its aegis were cosmopolitan and affluent. In 1577, the average Indian.

Since the death of the indigenous emperor Asoka in 232 B.C., large parts of the subcontinent had been conquered.

By the 1670s, the company could mint its own coin, maintain its own army, wage war, make peace, acquire new territories and impose its own civil and criminal law—and all without any accountability, save to its shareholders.

This was pure capitalism, unleashed for the first time in history.

The British government was beginning to agree, and over the following decades regulation began to creep in, act by act. Eventually, in 1834, the parliament in London decided that an empire based on trade was in poor taste, and drew up a new charter. The East India Company was still to govern, but no more to trade. Presenting the scheme to parliament, Thomas Babington Macaulay freely admitted that licensing out British sovereignty to a private company was inappropriate. “It is the strangest of all governments,” he said, “but it is designed for the strangest of all empires.” 8 But the British Crown could not bring its beast to heel. That would.

Take a revolt by the Indians themselves.

Battle of Plassey in 1757.

Once inside, it had been able to suck the wealth and riches out of India and impose its own regime—all by the grace of the Indian rulers. 11 “The English have not taken India,” wrote Mohandas Gandhi succinctly in 1908; “we have given it to them.” 12.

Meanwhile, the British retained the support of the Sikhs of the Punjab, the Pathans of the North-West Frontier, the Gurkhas of Nepal, and the armies of Bombay and Madras. Neither Calcutta nor Simla, the two seats of the company’s administration, was attacked. 18 Almost all the princes stayed.

Loyal to the British. The problem that had dogged the subcontinent since the death of Asoka, and would continue to dog it until 1947, was becoming clear.

A country not only divided between Mohammedan and Hindu, but between tribe and tribe, between caste and caste; a society whose framework was based on a sort of equilibrium, resulting from a general repulsion and constitutional exclusiveness between all its members. Such a country and such a society, were they not the predestined prey of conquest?” 19.

We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligation of duties which bind us to all our other subjects. In their prosperity will be our strength; in their contentment our security; and in their gratitude our best reward.” 24.

All Gandhi’s most famous tactics—passive resistance, civil disobedience, logical argument, nonviolence in the face of violence, emotional blackmail—had come from Kasturbai’s influence.

Being a saint, and it is perhaps even less so to live with one.

The Sikh leaders in Amritsar made him an honorary Sikh, staging a special ceremony in their holiest site, the Golden Temple.

British imperialism would be compelled to evacuate Great Britain itself before it would willingly evacuate India,” 3 sentiments with which the future king-emperor and his retinue would doubtless have agreed. Perhaps they did not realize how close the imperial trust was to being liquidated— without their consent.

The Indian states would have many more chances to impress the disoriented Prince of Wales as he traveled on through Udaipur to the extraordinary blue-painted town of Jodhpur.

By the time of the Prince of Wales’s tour, Jawahar had been confirmed as a rising star of the freedom movement, and one more radical than his august father. Motilal had been opposed to satyagraha in the first instance and argued that the sending of a few individuals to prison would make little difference. In particular, he was unhappy with the thought of Jawahar ending up there. A doting father does not send his only.

Beloved son to Harrow and Cambridge with the expectation that he will end up in a jailhouse. Yet Jawahar was determined to pursue satyagraha. Though even Gandhi advised him to do nothing that would upset Motilal, he could not be dissuaded. Father and son argued for several days. Jawahar pointedly began to eat bread and milk in the evenings from a steel bowl, amid the rest of the family’s crystal and Dresden china. Before one dinner he was fiddling with a piece of twine from a parcel and commented, “I wonder what it feels like to have a noose round one’s neck?” Swarup Rani nearly fainted; Motilal walked out and slammed the door. “Has this family no sense of humour left?”.

Asked Jawahar, crossly. 36 That night, Motilal secretly tried sleeping on the floor, wanting to understand the hardship his son would suffer in prison. 37.

He quoted his greatgrandmother Queen Victoria’s proclamation of 1858 about the Indians: “In their prosperity will be our strength; in their contentment our security; and in their gratitude our best reward.

His reason was a single incident of mob violence that occurred in the small town of Chauri Chaura in the United Provinces, the day after the Prince of Wales had been photographed with the Begum of Bhopal.

It is better to be charged with cowardice and weakness than to be guilty of denial of our oath and to sin against God.”.

The nonviolent method was not, and could not be, a religion or an unchallengeable creed or dogma. It could only be a policy and a method promising certain results, and by those results it would have to be finally judged. Individuals might make of it a religion or incontrovertible creed. But no political organisation, so long as it remained political, could do so.” 67.

Those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means.

Nehru quickly realized that the Mahatma’s argument provided the British with the permanent means to defeat him.

He wrote Edwina a piteous letter: “I wish I knew how to flirt with other women, and especially with my wife. I wish I’d sown more wild oats in my youth, and could excite more than I fear I do. I wish I wasn’t in the Navy and had to drag you out to Malta. I wish I had an equal share of the money so that I could give you far handsomer presents than I can really at present honestly manage. In other words, I’d like to feel that I was really worthy of your love.” 16.

As their marriage floundered, the Mountbattens’ separate pursuits grew ever more important. While Edwina partied, Dickie invented things. He became obsessed with time-saving devices. He equipped himself with elasticized shoes, had his suspenders stitched permanently to his trousers and wore a buttonless waistcoat that could.

Be pulled on over his head like a sweater. His valet even reported that Dickie invented a “Simplex” shirt with built-in Y-fronts, “that he could slide into like a stretch suit.” Edwina had started to find her husband tiresome and unattractive. 32 But her extramarital social life was not making her happy, either.

Meanwhile, the relationship between Gandhi and the younger Nehru was intense, fraught and semipaternal. The two men had wildly different political and philosophical ideas but a peculiarly potent sympathy with each other, both emotional and practical.

People who do not know Gandhiji personally and have only read his writings are apt to think that he is a priestly type, extremely puritanical, long-faced, Calvinistic, and a kill-joy,” Nehru wrote. “He is the very opposite … . His smile is delightful, his laughter infectious, and he radiates lightheartedness. There is something childlike about him which is full of charm.” 44.

Once again, by lack of elementary tact, the British did for us what we could not seem to do ourselves,” wrote Betty, wryly; “they unified India.” 60 The protests would give Jawaharlal Nehru his first experience of violence at the hands of the state.

In peacetime, the raj never took more than 7 percent of India’s income.

Indian police guards, commanded by a handful of British officers, ran forward to meet the first column of marchers and struck at them brutally with their steel-tipped lathis. “Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows,” Miller wrote. 9 The air filled with the grisly thud of steel against undefended skull. The first line fell in pools of their own blood, many struck unconscious. The rest marched on until they, too, were beaten down. Then a second column formed, and the same thing happened again.

Whether Gandhi had been very tiresome, to which he replied sharply, “Some people found Our Lord very tiresome.”.

From 15 February to 5 March, Irwin and Gandhi prepared a pact. Congress would discontinue its campaign of civil disobedience, lift the boycott on British goods and send a delegate to the second Round Table Conference. In return, political prisoners would be freed, the.

Swadeshi campaign would be approved and those Indians who lived near the sea would be allowed to make salt unhindered.

The pact reserved British control over defense, foreign policy, finance and the position of minorities. It did not challenge the extortionate tax rates on peasants; salt could be made but not sold; and there would be no investigation into allegations of police brutality.

Chaplin arrived first and went straight to the upstairs front room, where he waited and tried to think of things to say to the Mahatma.

Now came that uneasy, terrifying moment,” Chaplin remembered, “when I should say something astutely intelligent upon a subject I knew little about.” 19 Bravely, he ventured to declare himself sympathetic to India’s freedom struggle and asked Gandhi about his opposition to machinery. Gandhi gave his usual answer, about the real meaning of independence being the shedding of unnecessary things, while the photographers snapped away, flashbulbs popping.

For all his fame, the Mahatma was one man and therefore appeared to be in a minority. B. R. Ambedkar for the Untouchables, Tara Singh for the Sikhs and the Aga Khan and Mohammad Ali Jinnah for the Muslims all demanded separate concessions for their communities—and were more than able to shout Gandhi down.

When Gandhi eventually arrived back at Bombay, it was to a chorus of boos and the waving of black flags by two thousand Untouchable protesters, who viewed his insistence that they should not be given a separate electorate from caste-Hindus as an act of repression. 26.

To a considerable extent the delay may be attributed to the actions of three men: Winston Churchill, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Mohandas Gandhi. 27.

Our rule in India is as it were a sheet of oil spread out over and keeping free from storms a vast and profound ocean of humanity.

The British, in their role as paternalistic rulers, had a moral duty to protect them. If the British left, it would be a dereliction of that duty; therefore the British could not leave India. The existence of the Muslim League served to strengthen this argument. Meanwhile, it suited the Muslim League to have friends in the British establishment.

Jinnah was a successful barrister,.

Born in Karachi and called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn. Tall and slender, he hardly ate, and smoked fifty Craven A cigarettes a day. 31.

Undoubtedly one of the best dressed men in the British Empire.

Jinnah had begun his political career in Congress. He made himself a figurehead for Hindu-Muslim unity and was acclaimed as such by Hindu Congress luminaries. He had joined the Muslim League in 1913, confident that he could act as a bridge between the political parties. But it was the emergence of Gandhi as the spiritual leader of Congress in 1920 that began to push Jinnah out.

I part company with the Congress and Gandhi. I do not believe in working up mob hysteria. Politics is a gentleman’s game.

His Islam was liberal, moderate and tolerant. It was said that he could recite none of the Koran, rarely went to a mosque and spoke little Urdu.

Much has been made of his reluctance to don Muslim outfits, his fondness for whiskey and his rumored willingness to eat ham sandwiches. 36.

Much has been made of his reluctance to don Muslim outfits, his fondness for whiskey and his rumored willingness to eat ham sandwiches. 36 In fact, he never pretended to be anything other than a progressive Muslim, influenced by the intellectual and economic aspects of European culture as well as by the teachings of Muhammad.

Muslim League suffered from no shortage of good Muslims. What it had lacked was a good politician. And Jinnah was without question one of the most brilliant politicians of his day.

Gandhi’s need for spotless moral perfection hamstrung his party’s progress. His principal object was to make the Indian people worthy of freedom in the eyes of God. The object of actually achieving freedom from the British was secondary.

Gandhi’s most influential work, Hind swaraj, published in 1908, set out very clearly his point of view: that European civilization was corrupt, atheist and destructive, but that merely driving the British out of India would not serve to make India free. To be free, Indians needed to relinquish violence, material possessions,.

Machinery, railways, lawyers, doctors, formal education, the English language, discord between Hindu and Muslim, alcohol and sex.

It is impossible to assess how the Indian nationalist struggle might have proceeded without Gandhi, but there are.

Ample grounds for thinking that a more earthly campaign led by a united Congress, perhaps under the joint leadership of Motilal Nehru and Mohammad Ali Jinnah, could have brought dominion status to India in the 1920s. 44.

Gandhi’s spiritual style of leadership was a source of inspiration to millions, but, politically speaking, it was erratic. Within Congress, too, it created divisions. Congress was not a church, and Gandhi’s mystical judgments were often difficult even for his closest followers to accept.

It was not division he wanted, but respect for the Untouchables within Hinduism.

Ambedkar was outraged that Gandhi was fasting against the granting of separate electorates to Untouchables, while apparently not objecting to the same concession being given to Muslims or Sikhs. 49.

Tagore argued caustically that this supposedly “divine” justice, if such it was, constituted the least just form of punishment imaginable. 57.

Vacancy in his life. Gandhi still had four sons; but in 1936, there was a very public scandal involving his eldest. Harilal declared that he had converted to Islam, began calling himself Abdullah Gandhi and attacked his father in print.

At around this time, Gandhi suffered from the first of a series of nervous breakdowns. He left Kasturba and his followers and moved into a oneroom hut in central India, far from railways or post offices, and among a population mostly consisting of Untouchables. 59 As after Chauri Chaura, he withdrew from the political scene and focused on spiritual leadership. His hope for the future now was Jawaharlal Nehru.

What is this about your giving an assurance to Government? Do not give it!” 61 Back he went to prison, full of admiration. But their new closeness was not to last long. A few months later, at the beginning of 1935, Jawahar was allowed to visit Kamala for another couple of days—but found that she had grown distant. “Somehow things went wrong,” he wrote in his diary. “I felt there was a psychological change. She seemed reserved.”.

To much raising of eyebrows from those who had observed his devotion to Kamala, Feroze first proposed to Indira three years later. She refused, and he kept proposing until 1937, when she finally accepted on the steps of Sacré- Coeur in Paris.

She refused, and he kept proposing until 1937, when she finally accepted on the steps of Sacré- Coeur in Paris. Jawahar was among the disapprovers and asked her to return from Europe to Allahabad to think it over.

She refused to speak to him until he let her return to Feroze. 72 After a five-year wait for her to finish her education at Oxford, and many more fights with her father, she would marry Feroze in a Hindu ceremony.

Ten days later, for the first time in history, a king voluntarily abdicated the British throne.

The British Indian civil servant Penderel Moon called Congress’s rejection of the league at this point “a fatal error—the prime cause of the creation of Pakistan.” 93.

But, behind the celebrating, Muslim parties all over India were taken aback at Congress’s rejection of League participation, which, they feared, was a sign of the Hindu arrogance that Jinnah had long been warning them about.

“It went to my head, intoxicated me a little, and gave me confidence and strength. I became (I imagine so, for it is a difficult task to look at oneself from outside) just a little bit autocratic in my ways, just a shade dictatorial.” 101.

This powerful vilification was published under the pseudonym “Chanakya,” after an ancient political philosopher, and caused great outrage among Nehru’s loyal followers. What they did not realize was that “Chanakya” was actually Jawaharlal Nehru himself.

But the opposition to Nehru in Congress consisted of more than himself.

Bose was carried away with his own remarkable triumph over the Mahatma. He started calling himself “Netaji” (Dear Leader) in a deliberate imitation of Adolf Hitler’s title, “Führer.

February 1939, twelve members of the Congress Working Committee resigned, and Bose was left politically adrift. He was effectively beaten into resignation by May.

He did not believe that women should resist rape, but preferred that they should “defeat” their assailants by remaining passive and silent.

Gandhi advised the Jews in Germany to offer passive resistance to the Nazi regime—and to give up their own lives as sacrifices.

He would salve his self respect and leave an example which, if it became infectious, would save the whole of Jewry and leave a rich heritage to mankind besides.”.

Gandhi compounded this error of judgment by offering praise to Hitler. “I do not consider Herr Hitler to be as bad as he is depicted,” he wrote in May 1940. “He is showing an ability that is amazing and he seems to be gaining his victories without much bloodshed.”.

He regretted that Hitler had employed war rather than nonviolence to achieve his aims, but nonetheless averred that the Germans of the future “will honour Herr Hitler as a genius, a brave man, a matchless organizer and much more.”.

The American journalist Louis Fischer brought up this subject with Gandhi in 1946. By that time, the concentration camps had been discovered, and the true, awful extent of the Holocaust revealed. It might have been expected that the benefit of hindsight would have tempered the old man’s views.

It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher’s knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs … . As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions.

“I shall fight them to the end and this is my policy. I shall also fight Mr. Subhas Bose and his party along with Japan if he comes to India.” 11.

During the war years, Gandhi and Congress handed Jinnah a sixteenfold increase in his support. Quit India damaged the chances of a united India at least as much as any single act of the British administration ever had.

The contention that India should be given back to the Indians did not sit well with Churchill and the opposition, but they had little room for maneuver.

“We will have,” Jinnah announced, “either a divided India or a destroyed India.”.

The aged Mahatma had been “testing” his vow of celibacy by sleeping at night in bed with a naked or partially clothed woman.

The two main political parties in India had no real will to reach agreement among themselves,” he wrote; “the situation might so develop as to result in Civil War in India, & there seemed to be little realization among Indian leaders of the risk that ordered govt. might collapse.” He concluded, “The Indian leaders have got to learn that the responsibility is theirs & that they must learn how to govern.

Loquacious.

Both begged Mountbatten not to let the British leave India at all.

But for Congress, there was no body in India which would not move Heaven and Earth to keep the British.

Vallabhbhai Patel of Congress, ominously nicknamed “the Iron Man,” was a forcefully Hindu-nationalist lawyer, clever and cool. He was impervious to Mountbatten’s famous charm, describing the new viceroy as “a toy for Jawaharlalji to play with—while we arrange the revolution.” 28.

Criticism always bites harder when it comes dressed up as praise.

Thus Jinnah, he said, was “one of the most extraordinary men in history” and a “financially successful though mediocre lawyer,” who avoided taking any action that might split his party, such as holding debates or answering questions. The assessment had the taint of sour grapes to it, but Mountbatten did not seem to notice. 29.

Women were prominent in Indian politics, a trend which Edwina Mountbatten, along with many Indian women, attributed to Gandhism. Nonviolence, passive resistance and boycotts were all tactics which could be practiced by women without breaking social conventions; and Nehru had insisted as early as 1937 that the Congress manifesto pledge to remove all social, economic and political discrimination against women. As a result, there were more powerful women in India’s Congress than there were in Britain’s Labour Party or in the United States’ Democratic Party at the time.

The Mahatma launched upon an unsuspecting Mountbatten his plan to quell the bubbling discontent between Hindu and Muslim. It was an extraordinary suggestion. Jinnah was to be made prime minister and could form a cabinet entirely composed of Muslims if he wished.

The Mahatma launched upon an unsuspecting Mountbatten his plan to quell the bubbling discontent between Hindu and Muslim. It was an extraordinary suggestion. Jinnah was to be made prime minister and could form a cabinet entirely composed of Muslims if he wished. Congress would agree to cooperate freely and sincerely. This would, Gandhi believed, satisfy the Muslims that the new India was not to be.

A “Hindustan,” and that their rights and freedoms would be represented.

That day was April Fool’s Day, but Gandhi’s scheme was not a joke. He intended that Jinnah should be offered a chance to form an exclusively Islamic cabinet, despite the fact that the Muslim population of India was only around 25 percent, with the majority Congress Party meekly serving beneath them, and apparently did not foresee any potential upset in the already inflamed Hindu and Sikh communities as a consequence of this.

He described the old man as “going round with ointment trying to heal one sore spot after another on the body of India, instead of diagnosing the cause of this eruption of sores and participating in the treatment of the body as a whole.”.

The rejection prompted his withdrawal from formal involvement in negotiations for the transfer of power, though he would continue to contribute from the sidelines. 45.

May began, and with it came the first crippling outbreak of the inevitable “Delhi belly,” which felled both Mountbatten and Ismay.

It became the official summer capital of India. Here.

Though once a flamboyant youth, Nehru had become a man of simpler tastes. Yet there were two pleasures he could never resist: the vitality of mountain scenery and the company of an interesting woman.

Thanks to the war: it owed Egypt £450 million, Ireland £250 million, Australia and New Zealand £200 million each, and further enormous sums to Argentina, Norway and Brazil. But the largest creditor of all, with £1,250 million owed, was India.

Dominion status had been seen as.

I find myself all alone,” said Gandhi. “Even the Sardar [Patel] and Jawaharlal think my reading of the situation is wrong and peace is sure to return if partition is agreed upon … the future of independence gained at this price is going to be dark.”.

He may be a saint but he seems also to be a disciple of Trotsky,”.

Judge then of my astonished delight on finding him enter the room with his finger to his lips to indicate that it was his day of silence.

The next morning, the leaders of all parties arrived back at the Viceroy’s House, tired and acquiescent. Mountbatten was prepared to listen to their many reservations in private but decided that none should be allowed to speak at the meeting in case they upset each other. And so, for the first time in history, no party raised an objection against a plan for independence.

But it is curious that we should regard as a hero the man who liquidates the Empire which other heroes such as Clive, Warren Hastings and Napier won for us.

Mountbatten had chosen 15 August “out of the blue,” he admitted; it was the second anniversary of VJ Day, but nothing more significant than that. 12.

Dickie had always striven to impress her with his achievements at work. Perhaps, if he could carry out the transfer of power swiftly and efficiently enough, he might still save his marriage.

It was known that the maharaja wanted Kashmir independent, a scheme unpalatable to Nehru, Gandhi and the British. The Mountbattens’ visit to Kashmir was not a raging success. At the opening banquet, Dickie accidentally set off a bell that had been installed under the table, which alerted the band to play “God Save the King.”.

Nehru himself was a Kashmiri by descent, and his detachment would repeatedly fail him when dealing with his ancestral state.

Nehru himself was a Kashmiri by descent, and his detachment would repeatedly fail him when dealing with his ancestral state. Nonetheless, there was another reason for his desperation to secure Kashmir. If the North-West Frontier Province went to Pakistan, India would lose the Hindu Kush mountains—its natural defense against attack from the north.

If both the NWFP and Kashmir went to Pakistan, there would be nothing but farmland between India and the Soviets, the Afghans, the Pakistanis and the Chinese. 31 The danger from the north was real and immediate, especially after 2 July, when Afghanistan revived its old claim to territory on the North-West Frontier, comprising most of the land between the Indus River and the border.

Mountbatten had repeatedly proclaimed his preference for a united India, creating fears in the Muslim League that a joint governor-generalship might favor the reabsorption of Pakistan, in line with Congress hopes. 51.

Jinnah’s, argued that a joint governorgeneralship under Mountbatten would have meant Pakistan “getting destroyed at inception.” By July, Jinnah had very strong reasons to suspect that Mountbatten was wrapped around Nehru’s finger. “Nehru in those days was having a roaring love affair with Lady Mountbatten,” added Bakhtiar, “said to be with the tacit approval of Mountbatten.” 52.

But four of the most important states—Hyderabad, Kashmir, Bhopal and Travancore— wanted to become independent nations.

Each of these states had its own unique set of difficulties. The Nizam of Hyderabad was the richest man in the world; he was a Muslim, and his people were mostly Hindus. His state was enormous, and both France and the United States were rumored to be ready to recognize it. 35 The Maharaja of.

Kashmir was a Hindu; his people were mostly Muslims. His state was even bigger than Hyderabad but more limited by its lack of trade routes and industrial potential. The Nawab of Bhopal was an able and ambitious Muslim prince, and one of Jinnah’s advisers; unfortunately for him, his state had a Hindu majority and was stuck right in the middle of India, over five hundred miles from the likely border with Pakistan. Uranium deposits had recently been discovered in Travancore, lending the situation there a greater international interest.

The Hindu Maharaja of Jodhpur, who had just turned twenty-four and had only succeeded to the throne in June, provided a dramatic moment. Jinnah had been courting him, with plans that Patel.

Feared would create “a dagger into the very heart of India,” a spur of Pakistan that would run down through Jodhpur into Bhopal. Mountbatten explained to the maharaja that he was legally entitled to join Pakistan, but reminded him of his Hindu majority. “Your Highness is free to stay out, if you like,” Patel added. “But if there is trouble in your State as a result of your decision, you will not get the slightest support from the Government of India.” 45 The maharaja was shaken by this clear threat. He turned up at the Viceroy’s House and was fobbed off with V. P. Menon while Mountbatten dealt with a Hyderabad delegation in Edwina’s study next door.

Apparently, Menon was not to the.

Maharaja’s satisfaction. He pulled out a pistol concealed behind the nib of a very large fountain pen and screamed that he would “shoot him down like a dog if he betrayed the starving people of Jodhpur.” Menon talked him down, and the maharaja eventually put the gun away —later making a present of it to Mountbatten, who “gave him hell” for the incident. 46.

Nehru had broken down and wept, explaining that Kashmir meant more to him at the moment than anything else.” 64.

Whatever may be said about Mountbatten’s tactics or the machinations of Patel, their.

Achievement remains remarkable. Between them, and in less than a year, it may be argued that these two men achieved a larger India, more closely integrated, than had ninety years of the British raj, 180 years of the Mogul Empire, or 130 years of Asoka and the Maurya rulers.

A Sunni Muslim from the Punjab might have more in common with a Sikh than he did with a Shia Muslim from Bengal; a Shia might regard a Sufi Muslim as a heretic; a Sufi might get on better with a Brahmin Hindu than with a Wahhabi Muslim; a Brahmin might feel more at ease with a European than he would with another Hindu who was an outcaste.

Whether the British caused division by carving up politics on the basis of religion, or whether they were simply responding to a trend in Indian society for Hindu nationalism and the beginnings of an Islamic resurgence, is an endlessly debatable question.

In 1947, its significance was that it provided the only useful land link between India and Kashmir. Farther east along the Indo-Kashmiri border, the Himalayas rose so high as to prohibit a readily navigable route. Mountbatten has been accused of interfering with the decision on Gurdaspur, and certainly its fate had worried Nehru. 17 Most of it did eventually go to India, but there is good reason to think it would have done so anyway.

The governor, Sir Frederick Burrows, had predicted that an independent East Bengal without Calcutta would become a “rural slum.” It was felt among Muslims that partition of Bengal was a way of sabotaging East Pakistan. Mountbatten agreed. During the meeting, he made it clear several times that the whole point of the current policy was to allow Pakistan “to fail on its demerits.” If the plan presented to Jinnah was awful enough, the British thought, he could be made to reconsider the whole idea of Pakistan. 26.

On 26 April, Mountbatten asked.

On 26 April, Mountbatten asked Jinnah how he would feel if Bengal, as a whole, became independent rather than joining Pakistan. Jinnah replied unhesitatingly: “I should be delighted. What is the use of Bengal without Calcutta; they had much better remain united and independent; I am sure that they would remain on friendly terms with us.” 27 Congress, on the other hand, was under no circumstance prepared to countenance a fully independent Bengal, and the Muslim League in East Bengal was under no circumstance prepared to join India.

What was created, then, in East Bengal, soon to be East Pakistan.

And afterward Bangladesh, was a nation deliberately designed to be incapable of supporting itself. At least one half of Pakistan was set up to fail.

Gandhi has announced his decision to spend the rest.

Of his life in Pakistan looking after the minorities,”.

This will infuriate Jinnah, but will be a great relief to Congress for, as I have said before, his influence is largely negative or even destructive.

He has lived to see his followers transgress his dearest doctrines; his countrymen have indulged in a bloody and inhuman fratricidal war; non-violence, khadi and many another of his principles have been swept away by the swift current of politics. Disillusioned and disappointed, he is today perhaps the only steadfast.

Exponent of what is understood as Gandhism.

“You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,”.

“You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,” he declared, guaranteeing equality in Pakistan for all faiths and communities. He went further still: “in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim.

Jinnah’s speech on 11 August made it very clear that he intended Pakistan to be a secular state. “You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State,” he declared, guaranteeing equality in Pakistan for all faiths and communities. He went further still: “in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu community and the Muslim.

Community—because even as regards Muslims you have Pathans, Punjabis, Shias, Sunnis and so on and among Hindus you have Brahmins, Vashnavas, Khatris, also Bengalees, Madrasis and so on—will vanish,” he said. “Indeed if you ask me this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of India to attain freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free peoples long, long ago.” 40 These were peculiar words from the man who had long hindered independence precisely by reinforcing the division between Hindu and Muslim, and add weight to the theory that Jinnah may have been less serious about Pakistan as a Muslim homeland than as a playing piece.

Perhaps, all along, he had pursued not an Islamic state but rather a non-Hindumajority state. There was no time to worry about it. On 13 August, an exhausted Radcliffe delivered his award; the last few princely states were still squabbling over better deals; Gandhi, in Calcutta, tried desperately to hold Hindus and Muslims together; and Nehru, in Delhi, began to read reports of new outbreaks of disorder in the Punjab with growing concern. One hundred and fifty people, mostly Sikhs, had been murdered there in the previous.

For though there had been a revolution, the empire had not been overthrown. The British had got away with their dignity intact and their majesty undimmed.

Day, it brimmed with ordinary people. Where thirty thousand had been expected, at least ten times that number turned up; some estimates said as many as a million.

As a salute was fired, a rainbow broke across the sky—a detail that one would dismiss as fanciful, were it not for the fact that so many observers insisted they had seen it. 71 Mountbatten pointed up at this well-timed natural phenomenon, and the crowd went wild again. “I had never noticed how closely a rainbow could resemble the new Dominion flag of saffron, white and green,” he mused in his report to.

The next day, he was moved to tell Mountbatten’s press.

Attaché, “At last, after two hundred years, Britain has conquered India.” 73.

Gandhi had told him that there were two alternatives. Either British rule would be continued, or else there would be a bloodbath. “What should I do, then?” Mountbatten had asked. Gandhi’s reply was typical. “You must face the bloodbath and accept it.” 9.

Just eighteen months before, remembered the journalist Phillips Talbot, the naval mutineers in Bombay had roused great crowds with cries of “Death to Englishmen!” and “Britishers: Go Back!” Now the cry was “Jai England!” and “England zindabad!”.

Dickie was overjoyed and shouted “Jai Hind!” all the way along Marine Drive.

After 15 August, Mountbatten was the servant of the Union of India, and his prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had made unequivocal his opinion: “I would rather have every village in India go up in flames than keep a single British soldier in India a moment longer than necessary.” 38 Mountbatten’s staff agreed with Nehru.

Only seven British officers were killed in India between partition and the end of January 1948;.

Truth began to sink in. In 1946, Nehru had made three predictions to the journalist Jacques Marcuse. “One, India will never be a Dominion. Two, there will never be a Pakistan. Three, when the British go, there will be no more communal trouble in India.” Marcuse was back in.

In 1946, Nehru had made three predictions to the journalist Jacques Marcuse. “One, India will never be a Dominion. Two, there will never be a Pakistan. Three, when the British go, there will be no more communal trouble in India.” Marcuse was back in Delhi just after partition to interview him.

Again, but could not bring himself to remind Nehru of their previous conversation. In the end, Nehru brought it up himself. “You remember, Marcuse, what I told you? No Dominion, No Pakistan, No …” Both men were silent for a moment, until Nehru added wistfully, “Wasn’t I wrong?” 49.

As if such ordeals were not horrific enough, the media and public officials publicly glorified a distinctly feminine martyrdom. It was constantly suggested.

That the high point of female heroism was to commit suicide rather than face the “dishonor” of rape, as if the shame and guilt for the crime would fall on the victim rather than on the perpetrator.

In Stalin’s famous words, one death is a tragedy; one million deaths is a statistic.

What does it matter to the readers of history today whether there were two hundred thousand deaths, or a million, or two million? On that scale, is it possible to feel proportional revulsion, to be five times more upset at a million deaths than at two hundred thousand? Few can grasp the awfulness of how it might feel to have their fathers barricaded in their houses and burned alive, their mothers beaten and thrown off speeding trains, their daughters torn away, raped and branded, their sons held down in full view, screaming and pleading, while a mob armed with rough knives hacked off their hands and feet.

March had been the apogee of his power and influence; the 1930s a struggle, bitter and increasingly opposed, culminating in a private breakdown; the early 1940s a calamity, with the illjudged Quit India campaign and mass departure of Muslims from Congress; the later 1940s a wilderness, with his presence treated as an irritation. And yet, despite intense personal disaffection and marginalization by his colleagues, the Mahatma would rally for a final, spectacular swan song. With Calcutta detonating around him, he decided to fast.

On 2 September, the Mahatma renounced all food and sustenance except sips of water and reclined on a cot in a public room at the house in Belliaghatta. The effect was unprecedented. Over the course of little more than a day, the city calmed, and the processions to his house changed their.

Temper from angry mob to penitent pilgrimage. From all parties and all faiths, leaders came to beg with him to give up his fast and save his life. He replied that it was not a question of saving his life. The fast was “intended to stir the conscience and remove mental sluggishness”; if the people’s consciences were stirred, there might be the side effect that he would live. The hours passed, with burly goondas turning up to weep contritely by the Mahatma’s bedside. Finally, on the evening of 4 September, when all the city leaders had signed a pledge that there would be no further trouble in Calcutta, Gandhi broke his fast with a drink of fruit juice. 6 “In the Punjab we.

Have 55,000 soldiers and large scale rioting on our hands,” an awestruck Mountbatten wrote to him. “In Bengal our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting.” 7 To the wonder of all observers, Gandhi’s achievement would endure beyond his presence in the city. Aside from a few isolated incidents—no more than in normal times of peace— Calcutta remained orderly for months.

In Karol Bagh, between New and Old Delhi, children of all faiths were taking their matriculation examinations in a local high school, when goondas stormed in.

And demanded that the Muslim boys be separated from the rest. The boys were taken into another room and slaughtered like animals. 13.

To go under or overcome our difficulties. And we are not going under.” 40.

They have their Pakistan, we will have our Hindustan,” replied the man, at which Jawahar flew into a rage, grabbed him by the throat and shook him. “If I must die it is an honour to do so at your hands, Panditji,” gasped the man. Jawahar dropped him in disgust and returned to his car. 44.

While Dickie chaired committees, both Jawahar and Edwina fearlessly went out into the streets of Delhi to deal with the rioters. Edwina was with her friend, the health minister Amrit Kaur, when they heard that Jawahar had gone out alone. They went out and found him attempting to stop a crowd of armed men. “Brought him back!” Edwina wrote. 46 Another evening, Jawahar heard of an attack planned on the Jamia Millia Islamia, a Muslim college outside Delhi. The college was in the middle of riot-torn countryside. At night, the students, fearing for their lives, turned off their lamps and stood guard. They could hear splashes as Muslims from.

Nearby villages were chased into the Jumna River, pursued by mobs intent on drowning them.

To Patel’s embarrassment, Nehru put Mountbatten rather than him in charge of negotiation. Patel’s relationship with Nehru, never great, was rapidly souring. Patel made it clear that he thought Nehru was too soft on Muslims. Nehru made it clear that he disliked Patel’s Hindu-chauvinist tone.

With almost half of his cabinet tending toward the establishment of India as a Hindu nation, Nehru had to fight an increasingly hard battle against the swell of fundamentalist feeling.

77 “As long as I am at the helm of affairs India will not become a Hindu state,”.

77 “As long as I am at the helm of affairs India will not become a Hindu state,” Nehru announced in a public speech, with a deliberate dig at the orthodox members of his government. “.

If Nehru’s government fell, he warned, Patel would probably take over and install “an iron-handed system,” openly hostile to Pakistan.

It had always been assumed by the British, by the Muslim League and indeed largely by Congress apart from Nehru himself, that Kashmir would eventually go to Pakistan.

Instrument of accession.

But Nehru’s mind was filled with visions of losing his ancestral state to a plague of murderous tribesmen. Their faith did not.

Sam Manekshaw, India’s director of military operations, remembered the meeting that took place in Delhi at this time. Nehru, as usual, was attempting to contextualize the Kashmir situation, talking about it in relation to Russia, the United States, the United Nations and so on. Eventually, Patel exploded: “Jawaharlal, do you want Kashmir, or do you want to give it away?” “Of course I want Kashmir,” replied Nehru. Before he could add anything else, Patel turned to Manekshaw and said, “You have your orders.” It was Patel who went off to All-India Radio and.

Ordered a command requisitioning private aircraft, and Patel who organized the fly-in of Indian troops to Kashmir the next day. Only later did Mountbatten realize that the home minister must have had the whole operation planned in advance. 38.

He described Nehru and Patel as “enemies of Britain,” and the Muslims as Britain’s allies; and accused Mountbatten of planning and organizing “the first victory of Hindustan.

Their talks were almost always about ideas rather than gossip, but were never dry or sterile. Ideas were what made them passionate.

According to Nehru’s secretary, M. O. Mathai, Nehru paid a brief visit to Lucknow in the winter of that year. Sarojini Naidu was then the governor of the United Provinces, and a rumor spread that Nehru was in Lucknow to propose to his old girlfriend, Sarojini’s daughter Padmaja Naidu. Padmaja was ecstatic and prepared herself to accept. When Jawahar turned up, he was with Edwina. Padmaja locked herself in a room and refused to meet the governorgeneral’s wife. 86 Later, when Padmaja came to stay with him, Jawahar would find one of his framed photographs of Edwina smashed on the floor. 87.

To the distress of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel—never the best of friends—were developing a deep antipathy toward each other, splitting and stalling the government.

Many observers thought that once the freedom struggle was over, Congress should have split. 19 A strong right wing under Patel, and a strong left wing under Nehru, might have produced a balanced two-party system. But Congress stayed together, united more by sentimentality than by a common political goal. When.

The light has gone out from our lives and there is darkness everywhere,”.

And I do not know what to tell you and how to say.

And I do not know what to tell you and how to say it.”.

The light has gone out, I.

Said, and yet I was wrong. For the light that shone in this country was no ordinary light. The light that has illumined this country for these many, many years will illumine this country for many more years, and a thousand years later that light will still be seen in this country, and the world will see it, and it will give solace to innumerable hearts. For that light represented something more than the immediate present; it represented the living, eternal truths reminding us of the right path, drawing us from error, taking this ancient country to freedom.” 43.

The Indian government, he said, believed that Britain and the United States were backing Pakistan as part of their goal of maintaining Muslim solidarity in the Middle East. “It appears to me that Russia may well win India to her side by sponsoring her case,” he warned. “I must point out that if this does come to pass the only result will be that India is thrown into the arms of Russia; and Russia will appear throughout this country as the saviour of India against the machination of the United States and the United Kingdom.” 68.

I sometimes think our greatest crime against India.

Was to turn all her best sons into lawyers.”.

He was particularly concerned that India should become an oil-rich state. “Clearly the first requirement is to find the oil,” he noted. “To me it seems quite incredible that there should be oil to the north and west of India and oil to the east of India, but no oil has been found in India apart from Assam.” Geological surveys had previously drawn the conclusion that, incredible though it may have seemed, there really was none. No matter. Mountbatten recommended that they be redone.

The gods or some good fairy gave you beauty and high intelligence, and.

Grace and charm and vitality—great gifts—and she who possesses them is a great lady wherever she goes. But unto those who have, even more shall be given: and they gave you something that was even rarer than those gifts—the human touch, the love of humanity, the urge to serve those who suffer and who are in distress. And this amazing mixture of qualities results in a radiant personality and in the healer’s touch.

Wherever you have gone you have brought solace, and you have brought hope and encouragement. Is it surprising, therefore, that the people of India should love you and look up to you as one of themselves and should grieve that you are going? Hundreds of thousands have seen you personally in various camps and other places and in hospitals, and hundreds of thousands will be sorrowful at the news that you have gone. 111.

Jinnah saw Liaquat and told him that Pakistan was “the biggest blunder” of his life. Further yet, he declared, “If now I get an opportunity I will go to Delhi and tell Jawaharlal to forget about the follies of the past and become friends again.” 24 It is impossible to prove whether Jinnah actually said these words or not; either way, he was to have no further opportunity for a rapprochement.

Break open Rama’s heart, you will find Sita written on it; break open Nehru’s heart, you will find Lady Mountbatten written on it.”.

At 7:30 the next morning, the Turners’ secretary knocked on Edwina’s door. There was no reply. She opened it to see the Countess Mountbatten of Burma lying on the bed. Her body was already cold. She had suffered heart failure a few hours before. Still one of the world’s.

Richest women, she had had no splendid possessions with her; only a pile of old letters on the bedside table. She must have been reading them when she died, for a few, having fluttered from her hands, were strewn across her bed. They were all from Jawaharlal Nehru. 105.

Just as after the death of Gandhi, Nehru’s public face would be a mask, hiding his private grief.

The coffin was discharged into the waves from beneath a Union Jack. Mountbatten, in tears, kissed a wreath of flowers before throwing it into the sea. 111 The Wakeful was escorted by an Indian frigate, the Trishul. Jawaharlal Nehru had sent it all the way to the.

English Channel, just to cast a wreath of marigolds into the waves after Edwina’s coffin.

Began to bother a wider circle of people. “The Prime Minister is like the great banyan tree,” said S. K. Patil, the minister for food. “Thousands shelter beneath it but nothing grows.” 3 The remark irritated Nehru,.

Perhaps because it was true.

Padmaja had never married,” noted Marie Seton, “perhaps ever hoping to be asked by the man she so much loved.” 23 Soon, Nehru’s.

Padmaja had never married,” noted Marie Seton, “perhaps ever hoping to be asked by the man she so much loved.” 23.

Nehru had requested that most of his ashes be scattered from an airplane, “so that they might mingle with the dust and soil of India and become an indistinguishable part of India.”.

Unlike Jawahar, Indira found the processes of democratic government irritating and cumbersome. Soon she started to act without recourse to it. “My position among the people is uncontested,” she declared. 48 When she attacked the princes for their privy purses, Mountbatten was shocked and upset. “I do hope Indu will do nothing that could in any way dishonour her father’s word,” he wrote to Nan Pandit, “and I have written to her to this effect in.

As friendly a way as possible.” 49.

TODAY, THE India created by the Mountbattens, Nehru, Gandhi and Jinnah is on the way up.

Neither Nehru nor Jinnah has bequeathed exactly the legacy he would have wanted to his nation. Nehru’s vision encompassed an inclusive democracy, a planned economy and great investment in education. Some of these have fallen by the wayside, and he would have been horrified to observe the religious violence, disregard for the environment and callousness toward the.

Poor that have beleaguered India since his death.

Others have succeeded remarkably, notably in the culture of science and technology, the availability of education and the principle of secular democracy.

Others have succeeded remarkably, notably in the culture of science and technology, the availability of education and the principle of secular democracy. But Nehru had seventeen years at the head of India to make his mark. Jinnah had just one at the head of Pakistan.

There is still a picture of Edwina Mountbatten in Jawaharlal Nehru’s study.

India today is not Gandhi’s India, though there remains an enormous affection for him. There are elements of Gandhi’s India in the nation’s spirituality; elements of Nehru’s India in its education, culture and technology;.

That remain outside; and even elements of the Mountbattens’ India in the continuing.

Continuing.

Elements of Jinnah’s India in the parts that remain outside; and even elements of the Mountbattens’ India in the continuing membership of the Commonwealth held by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Gandhi launched a campaign that demanded equal rights for Indians in South Africa as citizens of the British Empire.

And I feel like saying to these noblemen: ‘There is no solution for India unless you strip yourselves of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your countrymen in India.’.

“I compare with the richly bedecked noblemen the millions of the poor,”.

Our salvation can only come through the farmer. Neither the lawyers, nor the doctors, nor the rich landlords are going to secure it.” 57 He.
