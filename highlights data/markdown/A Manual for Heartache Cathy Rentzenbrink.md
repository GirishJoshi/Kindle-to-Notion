Perhaps heartbreak is what happens on impact, and heartache is what we are left with as time passes, once the dust settles, when we are able to look up and around us but are still shrouded in sadness.

There were times in my past when I didn’t want to be alive. I thought my heart couldn’t bear the pain of the world and might one day just refuse to beat.

I thought I knew what my life was going to be like and now I don’t.’.

We try to impose a hierarchy on pain is really unhelpful for people who are suffering,.

I told them about Maya Angelou, how she said that there is no greater agony than carrying around an untold story.

We worry that if people knew what we were really like, they’d run away.

It’s too easy to let fear of saying the wrong thing lead to not saying anything at all.

People in distress may well take offence easily because they cannot be pleased. Our main duty is to let them and not take offence back.

If there is ever a time to seek meaning in tragedy – and I’m not sure there is – it certainly isn’t in the immediate aftermath.

Perhaps we need to accept that we don’t have the power to fix anyone, but could just be there for them with love.

When Matty and I were little and were trying to figure out the meaning of love, we decided that it meant you’d cry if someone died. And maybe that is it. I loved him, he died, and for years, I cried.

I used to be frightened of loving people because I thought I wouldn’t survive losing them, but now I see that making friends with grief, accepting it as part of being human, will liberate me to love even more, and that the love is always worth it.

As I watched myself on the screen say that reading was my only solace during dark times, that I found books easier to deal with than life, I realized that anyone with any knowledge of depression would know what I was talking about.

We don’t want to embarrass people or make them feel worried or miserable, so we create a version of ourselves that we think they will want to see.

The mind is simply another part of the body. It works hard, deserves our care and we shouldn’t feel ashamed about needing to give it some attention.

I rather like being disagreed with in real life – I don’t think I’m always right and enjoy having my ideas tested – but I can’t cope with it online. I’m not sure why it feels so brutal. Perhaps it’s the absence of eye contact, or the spectre of an unseen audience, but I find it anxiety-inducing.

No matter what happens, we always have dominion over ourselves.

A boggart is a monster that assumes the shape of the thing you fear most.

It’s quite something to realize that you can have power and influence over your own thoughts and moods. This is so important, as the terror of depression is that it might descend unbidden at any moment.

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows you nothing more nor less than your heart’s desire. The happiest person in the world, Dumbledore explains, would see only themselves, as they are.

What I’ve come to see is not that things happen for a reason, but that there is some sort of trick whereby you can look at your mangled wreckage and from it craft meaning and purpose.

‘So shines a good deed in a naughty world.’.

Josephine Hart, in her novel of that name, suggests that damaged people are dangerous because they know they will survive.

A lot of growing up is about learning to hide how you are feeling so you can protect yourself, and then a lot about being really grown-up is unpicking all those defensive measures and working out who you actually want to be. But for now . . . Kids.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it.

Everything is always less about you than you think it is, and more about you than you think it is.

‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’.

When I can’t decide whether or not to do something, I ask myself what I will wish I’d done at the end of my long life.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time. I will.

I will never think that an act of kindness was a waste of time.

It is, we know, better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.
