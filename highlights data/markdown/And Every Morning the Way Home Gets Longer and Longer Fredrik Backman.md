“The worst part about growing old is that I don’t get any ideas anymore.”.

Humans are a strange breed in the way our fear of getting old seems to be even greater than our fear of dying.

When a boy is just big enough to know how the world works but still young enough to refuse to accept it.

Noah’s feet don’t touch the ground when his legs dangle over the edge of the bench, but his head reaches all the way to space, because he hasn’t been alive long enough to allow anyone to keep his thoughts on Earth.

Grandpa knows he’ll always manage, because there are two things in life in which Grandpa’s faith is unwavering: mathematics and his grandson.

I never meant for you to read it, to be quite honest. I wrote it just because I was trying to sort out my own thoughts, and I’m the kind of person who needs to see what I’m thinking on paper to make sense of it.

It’s about fear and love, and how they seem to go hand in hand most of the time. Most of all, it’s about time. While we still have.

It’s about fear and love, and how they seem to go hand in hand most of the time. Most of all, it’s about time. While we still have it.

Isn’t that the best of all life’s ages, an old man thinks as he looks at his grandchild. When a boy is just big enough to know how the world works but still young enough to refuse to accept it.

His grandpa is next to him and is incredibly old, of course, so old now that people have given up and no longer nag him to start acting like an adult.

His grandpa is next to him and is incredibly old, of course, so old now that people have given up and no longer nag him to start acting like an adult. So old that it’s too late to grow up. It’s not so bad either, that age.

A group of people calculated how to fly three men to the moon when Grandpa was young, and mathematics took them all the way there and back again. Numbers always lead people back.

The place is strange but everything here is familiar, like someone stole all the things you grew up with and put them into the wrong house.

Grandpa always calls him “Noahnoah” because he likes his grandson’s name twice as much as everyone else’s.

The boy recognizes the flowers, they’re Grandma’s, they smell like Christmas.

For other children maybe that scent would be ginger biscuits and mulled wine, but if you’ve ever had a Grandma who loved things that grew then Christmas will always smell like hyacinths.

The bench is surrounded by trees, because Grandpa loves trees, because trees don’t give a damn what people think.

The girl is standing in front of him and smells like hyacinths, like she’s never been anywhere else. Her hair is old but the wind in it is new, and he still remembers what it felt like to fall in love; that’s the last memory to abandon him. Falling in love with her meant having no room in his own body. That was why he danced.

“I don’t mean it would be hard for you to understand, Noahnoah. I mean it’s hard for me to understand,”.

Noah can see that Grandpa is ashamed the minute.

There’s nothing wrong with being a bit scared, you said, because if you wet yourself it’ll keep the bears away!”.

That’s another of Grandpa’s favorite games, reciting the decimals of pi, the mathematical constant which is the key to calculating the size of a circle. Grandpa loves the magic of it, those key numbers which unlock secrets, open up the entire universe to us. He knows more than two hundred decimals of it by heart; the boy’s record is half that. Grandpa always says that the years will allow them to meet in the middle, when the boy’s thoughts expand and Grandpa’s contract.

Whenever Noah was scared of sleeping, Grandpa would take out a string and tie one end around his arm and the other around the boy’s and promise that if Noah had nightmares he only had to pull on the string and Grandpa would wake up and bring him straight back to safety.

“And you’re still in such a hurry to look at it that you never have time to do the dishes.” “Those who hasten to live are in a hurry to miss,”.

“And you’re still in such a hurry to look at it that you never have time to do the dishes.” “Those who hasten to live are in a hurry to miss,” she sometimes used to whisper to Noah, though he didn’t know what she meant before she was buried.

“The only time you’ve failed is if you don’t try once more.” “Exactly, Noahnoah, exactly. A great thought can never be kept on Earth.”.

“My memories are running away from me, my love, like when you try to separate oil and water. I’m constantly reading a book with a missing page, and it’s always the most important one.”.

“You never became ordinary to me, my love. You were electric shocks and fire.”.

“I’m angry because you think everything happened by chance but there are billions of people on this planet and I found you so if you’re saying I could just as well have found someone else then I can’t bear your bloody mathematics!”.

“I’m angry because you think everything happened by chance but there are billions of people on this planet and I found you so if you’re saying I could just as well have found someone else then I can’t bear your bloody mathematics!” Her fists had been clenched. He stood there looking at her for several minutes. Then he said that he loved her. It was the first time. They never stopped arguing and they never slept apart; he spent an entire working life calculating probabilities and she was the most improbable person he ever met. She turned him upside-down.

“You were never easy, darling difficult sulky you, never diplomatic. You might even have been easy to dislike at times. But no one, absolutely no one, would dare tell me you were hard to love.”.

“Noah has gotten so smart, my love.” “He always has been, it just took you awhile to catch up,” she snorts.

“Do you remember what you said, when we first fell in love, that sleeping was a torment?” “Yes. Because we couldn’t share our sleep. Every morning when I blinked awake, the seconds before I knew where I was were unbearable. Until I knew where you were.”.

“Do you remember what you said, when we first fell in love, that sleeping was a torment?” “Yes. Because we couldn’t share our sleep. Every morning when I blinked awake, the seconds before I knew where I was were unbearable. Until I knew where you were.” She kisses him. “I know that the way home is getting longer and longer every morning. But I loved you because your brain, your world, was always bigger than everyone else’s. There’s still a lot of it left.”.

Not everyone knows that water and sunshine have scents, but they do, you just have to get far enough away from all other smells to realize it.

“We lived an extraordinarily ordinary life.” “An ordinarily extraordinary life.”.

“She got lost in my heart, I think. Couldn’t find her way out. Your grandma always had a terrible sense of direction. She could get lost on an escalator.”.

“Noahnoah, promise me something, one very last thing: once your good-bye is perfect, you have to leave me and not look back. Live your life. It’s an awful thing to miss someone who’s still here.”.

The corners of the boy’s mouth reach his earlobes.

“And I don’t think you need to be scared of forgetting me,” the boy says after a moment’s consideration. “No?” The corners of the boy’s mouth reach his earlobes. “No. Because if you forget me then you’ll just get the chance to get to know me again. And you’ll like that, because I’m actually a pretty cool person to get to know.”.

‘Ted, we’re not going into space because we’re afraid of aliens. We’re going because we’re scared we’re alone.

‘Ted, we’re not going into space because we’re afraid of aliens. We’re going because we’re scared we’re alone. It’s an awfully big universe to be alone in.’ ”.

That’s why we get the chance to spoil our grandchildren, because by doing that we’re apologizing to our children.”.

“You were the first boy I met who knew how to dance. I thought it was probably best to seize the opportunity; who knows how often boys like that turn up?”.

And ask Ted about the guitar.” “It’s too late now.” She laughs inside his brain then. “Darling obstinate you. It’s never too late to ask your son about something he loves.”.

Feel new sympathy for the curmudgeons.
