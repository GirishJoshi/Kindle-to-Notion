Give reasons for water/gas Coning.

An overshot with a milling surface is helpful when trying to catch a rounder fish and a spear is a tool best suited for fishing a jagged opening.

Employ a very low rate ,low pressure solvent squeeze into formation followed by 24 to 72 hrs soaking.

May be reamed out, removed by hot oil or hot water, or dissolved with.

May be reamed out, removed by hot oil or hot water, or dissolved with solvent.

Melted paraffin or asphalt in the formation should be removed from the well before the wax cools and solidifies.

Coiled tubing is chosen over conventional straight tubing because conventional tubing has to be screwed together. Additionally, coiled tubing does not require a workover rig. Because coiled tubing is inserted into the well while production is ongoing, it is also a cost-effective choice and can be used on high-pressure wells.

Stress concentration at well bore.

Fracture propagates outward away from away high-compressive – stress concentration at well bore.

Only lower zone can be artiicial lifted  Upper zone sand production may stick tubing Single String Dual packer  Limitation  Casing Subjected to pressure and corrosion  Must kill both zones for workover of upper zone.

The condition necessary for horizontal fracture initiation is that the well bore pressure must exceed the vertical stress plus the vertical tensile strength of the.

Condition of vertical fracture initiation depends on the relative strength of two principal horizontal compressive stresses. To cause formation break down, the pressure in borehole must be somewhat greater than the minimum stress at the bore hole and must also overcome the tensile strength of the rock.
