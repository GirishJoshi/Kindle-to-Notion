It is ironic that what gives them their ‘super powers’ also becomes their kryptonite.”.

No. Research shows that what makes students likely to be impressive in the classroom is the same thing that makes them less likely to be home-run hitters outside the classroom.

Academic grades correlate only loosely with intelligence (standardized tests are better at measuring IQ). Grades are, however, an excellent predictor of self-discipline, conscientiousness, and the ability to comply with rules.

“Essentially, we are rewarding conformity and the willingness.

Many of the valedictorians admitted to not being the smartest kid in class, just the hardest worker.

Others said that it was more an issue of giving teachers what they wanted than actually knowing the material better. Most of the subjects in the study were classified as “careerists”: they saw their job as getting good grades, not really as learning.

“They’re extremely well rounded and successful, personally and professionally, but they’ve never been devoted to a single area in which they put all their passion. That is not usually a recipe for eminence.”.

What if I told you your son’s upper body would be too long, his legs too short, his hands and feet too big, and he’d have gangly arms? I doubt you’d jump for joy. None of those things sounds objectively “good.” But when a knowledgeable swim coach hears those things, he sees nothing but Olympic Gold.

Is Phelps physically perfect? Far from it. He doesn’t dance well. Or even run well. In fact, he doesn’t seem designed to move on land at all. But Mark Levine and Michael Sokolove both wrote pieces for the New York Times describing Phelps’s collection of odd traits as making him uniquely suited to being an awesome swimmer. Yes, he’s strong and lean, but for a six-foot-four-inch man he’s not normally proportioned. His legs are short and his trunk long – making him more like a canoe. He has disproportionately big hands and feet—better “flippers.” If you extend your arms out in either direction, the distance between your fingertips should match your height. Not for Phelps. His wingspan is six feet seven inches. Longer arms mean more powerful strokes in the pool.

So it’s no surprise that creativity is inversely correlated with employee performance reviews.

In some cases the greatest tragedies produce the greatest intensifiers. What do the following people all have in common?   Abraham Lincoln   Gandhi   Michelangelo   Mark Twain They all lost a parent before age sixteen. The list of orphans who became spectacular successes—or at least notoriously influential—is much longer and includes no fewer than fifteen British prime ministers.

“If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.”.

Traits like verbal fluency, adaptability, impulsivity, and humility are stable from childhood through adulthood.

When you choose your pond wisely, you can best leverage your type, your signature strengths, and your context to create tremendous value. This is what makes for a great career, but such self-knowledge can.

Can’t help but mention that an informal study showed that ethics books are 25 percent more likely to be stolen than the average library book.

There are three categories: “right,” “wrong,” and “everybody does it.”.

Well, it’s like the old joke about ethics. There are three categories: “right,” “wrong,” and “everybody does it.”.

“Not being nice may look promising at first, but in the long run it can destroy the very environment it needs for its own success.”.

We also all know someone everyone loves because they are so helpful, and they succeed because everyone appreciates and feels indebted to them.

Income was highest among those who responded with the number eight.

They miss out on a lot of what makes.

By not helping others, they.

Studies show spending money on others makes us happier than spending it on ourselves.

Research by Sonja Lyubomirsky shows that people are happier and less stressed when they “chunk” their efforts to help others versus a relentless “sprinkling.” So by doing all their good deeds one day a week, Givers make sure assisting others doesn’t hamper their own achievements. One hundred hours.

Depressed people are more accurate than optimists. It’s called “depressive realism.” The world can be a harsh place. Optimists lie to themselves. But if we all stop believing anything can change, nothing ever will. We need a bit of fantasy to keep us going.

“What is to give light must endure burning.”.

It’s the stories we tell ourselves that keep us going. They can be a higher truth. Or, in many cases, they don’t need to be true at all.

This is why lawyers are 3.6 times more likely to be depressed than people in other professions. To protect their clients, attorneys must consider every possible thing that can go wrong. They can’t tell themselves happy, less accurate stories about how a deal will unfold. Pessimists outperform optimists in law school. And this same quality makes them very unhappy. Law is the highest paid profession in the United States and yet, when surveyed, 52 percent of lawyers described themselves as dissatisfied with their jobs. You can guess what effects this has on grit: the legal profession has high attrition rates. To quote Liz Brown, “Law is the only career I know that has a sub-profession dedicated to helping people get out of it.”.

Research shows that the most motivating thing is progress in meaningful work.

“The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.”.

I hope you will not think me presumptuous or rude if I say that one of the secrets of productivity . . . is to have a very big waste paper basket to take care of all invitations such as yours.

The more extroverted you are, the worse you are at your job.

As we saw, having lots of friends has clear benefits . . . but can also be an enormous distraction.

It is better to give than to receive. Look for opportunities to do something for the other person, such as sharing knowledge or offering an introduction to someone that person might not know but would be interested in knowing. Do not be transactional about networking. Do not offer something because you want something in return. Instead, show a genuine interest in something you and.

In fact, research shows we’d rather work with a kind fool than a competent jerk when given the option.

Asking for advice, however, can really help others warm to you.

Also, University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo found that when we leverage Facebook to set up face-to-face meetings, it boosts our happiness. When we use it as a substitute, however, it increases loneliness.

Never ask a mentor a question Google can easily answer for you. Carve this in stone. Scrawl it in blood above your desk. Get a tattoo of it. You can learn the basics of any subject on Khan Academy. And you should have already done all that work. Asking.

And you should have already done all that work. Asking your mentor a question is like a power up in a video game. Don’t waste them. Use them when they’ll really count.

Listening to other people’s ideas increases brainpower.

One study showed that social interactions can actually make us smarter. But there’s a catch: to get the cognitive boost, you need to take the other person’s perspective. And you can’t do that if you’re not paying attention.

“Who is the only person in your life who is available 24/7 to provide you with care and kindness? You.”.

Everyone will tell you how hard it is to write a book but most don’t mention how lonely it is. I could not have done it without these fine people:.

“The only place where success comes before work is a dictionary.”.

“Those individuals with the highest total output will, on average, produce the most acclaimed contributions as well.”.

“Those who stayed very involved in meaningful careers and worked the hardest, lived the longest.” Meaningful work means doing something that’s (a) important to you and (b) something you’re good at. Plenty of research shows that if you do those things you’re uniquely good at (psychologists call them “signature strengths”), they’re some of the biggest happiness-boosting activities of all. A Gallup study reported, “The more hours per day Americans get to use their strengths to do what they do best, the less likely they are to report experiencing worry, stress, anger, sadness, or physical pain.” Imagine what life would be like if your job entailed using your signature strengths all day, every day. Of course you’d work long hours. Who’d want to go home?.

“Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.”.

(Not bad for a guy who was rejected for military service because he had sweaty feet.).

Einstein said, “I treat my wife as an employee whom I cannot fire.”.

“The true artist will let his wife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his art.”.

“One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers is that they’re not having good relationships. They’re busy making money and attending to themselves and that means there’s less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count.”.

To think about this another way, do you accomplish more in three hours when you’re sleep deprived or in one hour when you feel energetic, optimistic, and engaged?.

We love having choices. We hate making choices. Having choices means having possibilities. Making choices means losing possibilities. And having so many choices increases the chance of regret. When work is always a choice, everything is a trade-off. More time working means less time with your friends, spouse, or kids. And if you choose wrong, it’s your fault, making choices even more stressful.

First I’ll work a job I hate and make a lot of money and then I’ll have a family and then I’ll.

First I’ll work a job I hate and make a lot of money and then I’ll have a family and then I’ll do what I want and be happy.

Most of us use our calendars all wrong: we don’t schedule work; we schedule interruptions. Meetings get scheduled. Phone calls get scheduled. Doctor appointments get scheduled. You know what often doesn’t get scheduled? Real work. All those other things are distractions. Often, they’re other people’s work. But they get dedicated blocks of time and your real work becomes an orphan. If real work is the stuff that affects the bottom line, the stuff that gets you noticed, the thing that earns you raises and gets you singled out for promotion, well, let me utter blasphemy and suggest that maybe it deserves a little dedicated time too.

“The only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”.
