I know that life is in its basis a mystery; a river flowing from an unseen source and in its development an infinite subtlety; a “dome of many-colored glass,” too complex for thought, much less for utterance.

Our grasp is greater than our reach; but therefore our reach is made greater than that grasp.

If you find anything original here it will be unintentional, and probably regrettable.

If you find anything original here it will be unintentional, and probably regrettable. Knowledge grows, but wisdom, though it can improve with years, does not progress with centuries. I cannot instruct Solomon.

He cries; he has been so long asleep in the quiet warm womb of his mother; now suddenly he is compelled to breathe, and it hurts; compelled to see light, and it pierces him; compelled to hear noise, and it terrifies him. Cold strikes his skin, and he seems to be all pain. But it is not so; nature protects him against this initial onslaught of the world by dressing him in a general insensitivity. He sees the light only dimly; he hears the sounds as muffled and afar. For the most part he sleeps. His mother calls him a “little monkey,” and she is right; until he walks he will be like an ape, and even less of a biped, the womb-life having given his funny little legs the incalculable flexibility of a frog’s. Not till he talks will he leave the ape behind, and begin to climb precariously to the stature of a human being.

For the rest he learns by imitation, though his parents think he learns by sermons. They teach him gentleness, and beat him; they teach him mildness of speech, and shout at him; they teach him a Stoic apathy to finance, and quarrel before him about the division of their income; they teach him honesty, and answer his most profound questions with lies. Our children bring us up by showing us, through imitation, what we really are.

Life is that which is discontent, which struggles and seeks, which suffers and creates.

It loves new and dangerous things; a man is as young as the risks he takes.

It is asked to be quiet when noise is the vital medium of youth; it is asked to be passive when it longs for action; it is asked to be sober and judicious when its very blood makes youth “a continuous intoxication.” It is the age of abandon, and its motto, undelphianly, is Panta agan—“Everything in excess.” It is never tired; it lives in the present, regrets no yesterdays, and dreads no morrows; it climbs buoyantly a hill whose summit conceals the other side.

For the majority of us it is the only period of life in which we live; most men of forty are but a reminiscence, the burnt-out ashes of what was once a flame.

For the majority of us it is the only period of life in which we live; most men of forty are but a reminiscence, the burnt-out ashes of what was once a flame. The tragedy of life is that it gives us wisdom only when it has stolen youth.

Pouvait!—“If youth knew how, and old age could!”.

Let us ask the gods not for possessions, but for things to do; happiness is in making things rather than in consuming them.

Years ago, when a bespectacled Chinese student described American universities as “athletic associations in which certain opportunities for study are provided for the feeble-bodied,” his remark was not so destructive as he supposed, and it described himself as much as the universities. Every philosopher, like Plato, should be an athlete; if he is not, let us suspect his philosophy. “The.

Every philosopher, like Plato, should be an athlete; if he is not, let us suspect his philosophy.

“The first requisite of a gentleman,” said Nietzsche, “is to be a perfect animal.”.

Meanwhile youth is learning to read (which is all that one learns in school), and is learning where and how to find what he may later need to know (which is the best of the arts that he acquires in college).

The discovery darkens life for some.

The discovery darkens life for some years; we begin to mourn the brevity of the human span, and the impossibility of wisdom or fulfillment within so limited a circle; we stand at the top of the hill, and without straining our eyes we can see, at its bottom, death. We work all the harder to forget that it is waiting for us; we turn our eyes back in memory to the days that were not darkened with its presence; we revel in the company of the young because they cast over us, transiently and incompletely, their.

A man is as old as his arteries, and as young as his ideas.

The ability to learn decreases with each decade of our lives, as if the association fibers of the brain were accumulated and overlaid in inflexible patterns.

And yet what if it is for life’s sake that we must die? In truth we are not individuals; and it is because we think ourselves such that death seems unforgivable. We are temporary organs of the race, cells in the body of life; we die and drop away that life may remain young and strong. If we were to live forever, growth would be stifled and youth would find no room on the earth. Death, like style, is the removal of rubbish, the.

We are temporary organs of the race, cells in the body of life; we die and drop away that life may remain young and strong.

Three thousand years ago a man thought that man might fly, and so he built himself wings, and Icarus—his son—trusting them and trying to fly, fell into the sea. Undaunted, life carried on the dream. Thirty generations passed, and Leonardo da Vinci, spirit made flesh, scratched across his drawings (drawings so beautiful that one catches one’s breath with pain on seeing them) plans and calculations for a flying machine, and left in his notes a little phrase that, once heard, rings like a bell in the memory—“There shall be wings.” Leonardo failed and died, but life carried on the dream. Generations passed, and men said man would never fly, for it was not the will of God. And then man flew, and the agelong challenge of the bird was answered. Life is that which can hold a purpose for three thousand years and never yield. The individual fails, but life succeeds. The individual is foolish, but life holds in its blood and seed the wisdom of generations. The individual dies, but life, tireless and undiscourageable, goes on, wondering, longing, planning, trying, mounting, longing.

And when they pass they will cheat death with their children, with parental care that will make their children a little finer than themselves. Life wins.

The world is not “my idea,” as Schopenhauer called it; it is a stern reality of which you and I are passing spawns.

Logic itself is a human creation,.

Logic itself is a human creation, and may be ignored by the universe.

But it was Darwin, too, who opened a way to what John Morley called “the next great task of science—to create a new religion for humanity.”.

If I could live another life, endowed with my present mind and mood, I would not write history or philosophy, but would devote myself to establishing an association of men and women free to have any tolerant theology or no theology at all, but pledged to follow as far as possible the ethics of Christ, including chastity before marriage, fidelity within it, extensive charity, and peaceful opposition to any but the most clearly defensive war.

Personally I should define morality as the consistency of private conduct with public interest as understood by the group.

We give our offspring twenty years of care and education and then conscript them for murder and death in foreign wars. We preach Christ to them and then cheat so much in business that the government has to intervene to protect the consumer against deceptive labels, dangerous cars, poisonous drugs, chemicalized food, and shoddy goods, while the government itself competes in corruption and mendacity.

No one will believe me when I claim that I have often been aroused by the beauty of a woman without desiring her in any physical sense or degree; according to me my excitement was purely esthetic. Perhaps I deceive myself, and I will take no oath as to the lusts hiding in my “unconscious” or in my blood. But I insist that time and again I have longed to approach a woman timidly and thank her for being such a joy to behold, and that in this longing I felt no ambition to possess her, or even to touch her hand.

They give the race fewer geniuses than men do, but also fewer idiots. Intellect is sharpened in men by economic competition or political finagling; women do not need so much of it because they are normally destined to motherhood, in which instinct rules; and usually they win by instinct all that the male has acquired by intellect.

I marvel at the velvet smoothness of her skin, the creamy softness of her hands, the delicate touch with which she strokes your face and lightens your purse.

No biologist could think of God except in feminine terms, for generally, in the world of life, the male is a tributary incident, usually subordinate, sometimes superfluous.

Left the room dazed with shame at my helplessness, and mumbling to myself: “I must always be kind to women.” Let the sins of woman lie gently on her head, for she is the forgiving mother of us all.

In this perspective even eating is subordinate, however primary; it comes first, and without it life could not be; but it, too, is servant to sex; the unconscious purpose of our eating is to preserve and develop us for biological maturity—i.e., the ability to reproduce. When we have fulfilled that function we eat in order to survive as caretakers for our progeny. When we have completed both of these functions nature has no further use or regard for us; normally we would soon thereafter die; if we go on living it is as dispensable bystanders in the procession of life.

Strife is dramatic, and (to most of our historians) peaceful generations appear to have no history.

In our saner moments we know that it is not so; that lucid intervals of peace far outweigh, in any nation’s story, the mad seizures of war; that the history of civilization—of law and morals, science and invention, religion and philosophy, letters and the arts—runs like hidden gold in.

Perhaps all vices were once virtues, indispensable in the struggle for existence; they became vices only in the degree to which social order and increasing security rendered them unnecessary for survival. Once men had to chase, to kill, to grasp, to overeat, to hoard; a hundred millenniums of insecurity bred into the race those acquisitive and possessive impulses which no laws or morals or ideals, but only centuries of security, can mitigate or destroy.

Once men had to chase, to kill, to grasp, to overeat, to hoard; a hundred millenniums of insecurity bred into the race those acquisitive and possessive impulses which no laws or morals or ideals, but only centuries of security, can mitigate or destroy.

Since, by and large, those groups survived that excelled in food-getting, mate-getting, and fighting, these instincts have been selected and intensified through the generations, and have budded into a hundred secondary forms of acquisition, venery, and strife.

Prejudice is fatal to philosophy, but indispensable to a nation.

These standard provocations to conquest have been sharpened and magnified by the Industrial Revolution. To make war successfully, a modern nation must be wealthy; to be wealthy it must develop industry; to maintain industry, it must, in most cases, import food, fuel, and raw materials; to pay for these, it must export manufactured goods; to sell these, it must find foreign markets; to win these, it must undersell its competitors or wage foreign war. As like as not, it will make war for any of the goods it considers vital, or for control of the routes by which they must come.

Greece fought for control of the Aegean, the Hellespont, and the Black Sea, because it was dependent upon Russian grain. Rome had to conquer Egypt because it needed corn, and Asia Minor because it needed markets for its handicrafts and fortunes for its politicians. Egyptian wheat, Near Eastern oil, and Indian cotton explain many a battle in British history; Spanish silver explains the wars of Rome with Carthage; Spanish copper has something to do with German aid to Fascist Spain. Our sinless selves had a taste for sugar in 1898; and far back in 1853 we pointed our gifts and cannon at a Japanese government and persuaded Japan to transform itself into an industrial nation eager for foreign markets and spoils.

Since men are by nature unequal it follows that in any society a majority of abilities will be possessed by a minority of men;.

Since men are by nature unequal it follows that in any society a majority of abilities will be possessed by a minority of men; from which it follows that sooner or later, in any society, a majority of goods will be possessed by a minority of men. But this natural concentration of wealth impedes, by the repeated reinvestment of profits in promoting production, widespread purchasing power among the people; production leaps ahead of consumption; surpluses rise and generate either depression or war. For either production must stop to let consumption catch up, or foreign markets must be found to take the surplus that was unpurchased at home.

The League of Nations (except under Briand and Stresemann) was a conspiracy of the victors to preserve their gains; it had to fail as soon as the fertility and industry of the defeated had altered the balance of national power prescribed by the Treaty of Versailles.

Pacifism would be a cure for war if it could survive the call to arms and national defense; the same English youth that had, in the Oxford Union, vowed never to take up arms for England, took them up manfully against Hitler.

Vague appeals to the conscience of mankind to put an end to war have had little effect throughout history, for there is no conscience of mankind. Morality is a habit of order generated by centuries of compulsion; international morality awaits international order; international order awaits international force; conscience follows the policeman. A wise people will love peace and keep its powder dry.

The American presidency is a dictatorship limited in time, allowing impotent public criticism, and ultimately guided by generals and admirals. Armed with this strategy, American presidents have repeatedly initiated military intervention in foreign states, and Congress, faced by an accomplished fact, has felt compelled to approve.

I would rather have America lose her empire than have her forfeit all the inspiration that she has meant to mankind.

If the Founding Fathers could come back they would be amazed at the degree to which we have reduced poverty, drudgery, illiteracy, and governmental tyranny. A large part of the utopias described by Thomas More, Samuel Butler, Edward Bellamy, and H. G. Wells has been materially realized, along with the universal education, adult suffrage, freedom of speech, press, assembly, and religion which were among the hopes and dreams of eighteenth-century philosophers.

What are the needs and impulses that make a man spend years of preparation, and then months of labor, to produce a work of art? Presumably because he wishes to express himself, his ideas, and his moods; because he longs for distinction and reward; because he has a keener sense of beauty than most of us; because he aspires to combine the partial beauties and veiled meanings of actual but transitory forms in a vision of clearer significance or more lasting loveliness. Usually he sees more than we see, in fuller intensity or detail; he wishes to remove some of these perceived aspects in order to leave the essence and import of the scene more movingly visible to our eyes and souls. To do this he may deliberately sacrifice beauty, and crowd a wall or canvas with distorted figures, as in El Greco or Modigliani, or with bloated peasants, as in the Brueghels, or with chaotic horrors, as in Hieronymus Bosch. Philosophers have shown more hesitation in defining beauty than in describing God. Aristotle considered the basic elements of beauty to be symmetry, proportion, and an organic order of parts in a united whole. This conception, like the “Aristotelian unities” in drama, is the classic ideal in literature and art, but it drives Romantic spirits to rebellion and scorn; to them excess is the secret of success, and feeling, not reason, is the source and message of art. Many Japanese artists, tired of symmetry, proportion, and order, found beauty or satisfaction in surprising deviations from regularity of form.

Art without science is poverty, and science without art is barbarism. Let every science strive to fulfill itself in beauty or wisdom, and let us rejoice when a science becomes an art.

That education is of most worth which opens to the body and the soul, to the citizen and the state, the fullest possibilities of their harmonious life.

First, the control of life, through health, character, intelligence, and technology; second, the enjoyment of life, through friendship, nature, literature, and art; and, third, the understanding of life, through history, science, religion, and philosophy. Two processes constitute education and unite in it; in the one, the race transmits to the growing individual its profuse and accumulated heritage of knowledge, techniques, morals, and art; in the other, the individual applies this inheritance to the development of his capacities and the adornment of his life. In proportion as he absorbs this legacy he is transformed from an animal into a man, from a savage into a citizen. Perhaps, if his digestion is good, he is transformed from a simpleton to a sage. Education is the perfecting of life—the enrichment of the individual by the heritage of the race.

Vicious when one is in perfect health. I should make education in health a required course in every year of schooling from kindergarten to PhD.

We have no word in our language to express for the once-weaker sex those qualities which in the male are now connoted by the word gentleman; lady brings to mind some haughty and bejeweled duchess rather than the simple and understanding kindliness of a woman who has borne children and loved them.

The Industrial Revolution, by drawing sons and daughters into independent employment, deprived parental authority of its economic base.

So the family, which for thousands of years served as the fount and bastion of disciplined character and social order, lost its economic functions and its moral force.
