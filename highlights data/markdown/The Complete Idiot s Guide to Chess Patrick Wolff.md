To begin a game, the board must be placed so that the right-hand corner square nearest each player is white. Throughout this book, we will refer to pictures of the board, called “Diagrams,” that look like Diagram 1. Notice that the bottom right-hand corner in this and every Diagram is white!.

A file is a row of eight squares going from top to bottom. A rank is a row of eight squares going from left to right. Notice that a chessboard has eight files and eight ranks.

“The pawn is the soul of chess,”.

Each side gets only one queen.

Sometimes people get confused about whether the white queen starts on d1 or e1, and whether the black queen starts on d8 or e8. It is easy to remember if you keep in mind that chess was played when chivalry was still very much alive, so as a sign of respect to the queen it always starts the game on the same color square as she.

If you have a computer you can play chess with, here’s a good way to practice reading and writing chess moves: Play a game against the computer, and have it list the moves of the game. While you are playing, you should write down both your moves and its moves without looking at the computer’s list of the moves. When the game is finished, compare your record of the moves with the computer’s.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture.

The best way to remember this rule is to understand its point. The idea is to not let a pawn sneak by an opposing pawn without giving the opposing pawn one chance to capture it. In Diagrams 1 and 2, by moving two squares forward the white pawn was able to pass by the d3 square, which the black pawn controls, and get to safety on d4. In doing so, it “passed by” the opposing pawn’s control of the square in front of it. The en passant rule gives the opposing pawn one chance to capture the pawn as if it had moved only one square; that is, to capture it as it passes by the square it controls. But the opposing pawn only gets one chance! If it doesn’t capture the pawn on the very next move, then the en passant capture is no longer possible.

What’s the complaint?.

Chess is a really interesting game. All pieces can move forward or backward, other than pawns who can pawns. But that's not the reason why chess is interesting. All pieces remain themselves, or they die as the game proceed. A queen starts as a queen and ends as a queen, alive or dead. A bishop starts as a bishop and ends as a bishop, alive or dead. But a pawn, a pawn if alive, has the potential to became a knight, or bishop, or rook, or even a queen. A pwan can be whatever it wishes to be on reaching the end of line. You know why? Because a pawn will sacrifice itself, but will not move backwards.

Well, remember that unlike all the other pieces, the pawn can’t move backwards. This means that as the pawn marches forward, it’s on a one-way trip.

One of the worst ways to resign is to pick up your king, throw it across the room and stomp off screaming, “Why must I lose to this imbecile!” (I’ve seen it happen.).
