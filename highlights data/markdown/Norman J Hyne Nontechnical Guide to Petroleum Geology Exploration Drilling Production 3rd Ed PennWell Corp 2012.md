One type of trap is a natural arch in the reservoir rock (fig.I–2) called a dome or anticline.

Two common sedimentary rocks that can be caprocks are shale and salt.

Seismic exploration is commonly used today to locate subsurface traps. The seismic method uses a source and detectors (fig.I–4). The source, such as dynamite, is located on or near the surface and gives off an impulse of sound energy into the subsurface. The sound energy bounces off sedimentary rock layers and returns to the surface to be recorded by the detectors. Sound echoes are used to image the shape of subsurface rock layers and find traps.Fig.I–3. Rock outcrops on surface above a dome Fig.I–4.

Horizontal wells typically produce oil and gas at a greater rate than vertical wells.Fig.I–6. Well cutting removal by circulating drilling mud on bottom of well • xviii •.

The production rate from wells can be increased by acid and frac jobs. Acid is pumped down a well to dissolve some of the reservoir rock adjacent to the wellbore during an acid job. During a frac job, the reservoir rock is hydraulically fractured with a liquid pumped under high pressure down the well. Propping agents such as sand grains are pumped down the well with the frac fluid to hold the fractures open and allow the oil and gas to readily flow into the well.Periodically, production from the well must be interrupted for repairs or to clean out the well during a workover. A service company drives out to the well with a production unit to do the workover.

Ultimate recovery of gas from a gas reservoir is often about 80% of the gas in the reservoir.

Enhanced oil recovery involves pumping fluids such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or steam down injection wells to obtain more production.

At the refinery, there are two types of crude oils. An asphalt-based crude oil contains little or no paraffin wax and is usually black. When refined, it yields a large percentage of high-grade gasoline and asphalt. A paraffin-based crude oil contains little or no asphalt and is usually greenish. When refined, it yields a large percentage of paraffin wax, high-quality lubricating oil, and kerosene. A mixed-base crude oil is a combination of both types.

Freshwater has an °API gravity of 10. The °API gravities of crude oils vary from 5 to 55. Average density (weight) crude oils are 25 to 35. Light oils are 35 to 45. They are very fluid, often transparent, rich in gasoline, and the most valuable. Heavy oils are below 25. They are very viscous and dark colored, contain considerable asphalt, and are less valuable.

Sweet crudes have less than 1% sulfur by weight, whereas sour crudes have more than 1% sulfur.

A benchmark crude oil is a standard for a country against which other crude oils are compared, and prices are set. In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is 38 to 40°API gravity and 0.3% S, and West Texas Sour, a secondary benchmark, is 33 °API gravity and 1.6% S.Brent, the benchmark crude oil for the North Sea is very similar to WTI and is 38°API gravity and 0.3%S. Dubai is the benchmark crude oil for the Middle East at 31°API gravity and 2%S. Pour point All crude oils contain some paraffin molecules. If the paraffin molecules are 18 carbon atoms or longer in length, they are waxes that are solid at surface temperature. A crude oil that contains a significant amount of wax is called a waxy crude oil. In the subsurface reservoir where it is very hot, waxy crude oil occurs as a liquid. As the oil comes up the well, it cools, and the waxes can solidify. This can clog the tubing in the well and flowlines on the surface. The well then has to be shut in for a workover to clean out the wax. The amount of wax in crude oil is indicated by the pour point of the oil. A sample of the oil is heated in the laboratory. It is then poured from a container as it is being cooled. The lowest temperature at which the oil will still pour before it solidifies is called the pour point. Crude oil pour points range from +125° to −75°F (+52° to −59°C). Higher pour points reflect higher wax content. Cloud point is related to pour point. It is the temperature at which the oil first appears cloudy as wax forms when the temperature is lowered. It is 2° to 5°F (1° to 3°C) above the pour point. Very waxy crude oils are yellow in color. Slightly waxy crude oils can have a greenish color.Low- or no-wax oils are black. Crude oil from the Altamont area in the Uinta basin of Utah are very waxy with pour points ranging from +65° to +125°F (+18° to +52°C) and are heavy (19°API gravity) to light (54°API gravity)• 5 •.

A metric ton of average weight crude oil (30°API gravity) is 7.19 barrels in volume.

Refining First, during the refining process, various components of crude oil are separated by their boiling points. In general, the longer the hydrocarbon molecule, the higher its boiling temperature. At the refinery, crude oil is heated in a furnace until most of it is vaporized.

The formation, dissolved, or solution gas/oil ratio (GOR) is the number of cubic feet of natural gas dissolved in one barrel of oil in the subsurface reservoir. The measurements are reported under surface conditions of temperature and pressure (standard cubic foot per barrel, or scf/bbl). In general, as the pressure of the reservoir increases with depth, the amount of natural gas that can be dissolved in crude oil increases.

The producing GOR of a well is the number of cubic feet of gas the well produces per barrel of oil.

Nonassociated natural gas is gas that is not in contact with oil in the subsurface, and it is almost pure methane. Associated natural gas occurs in contact with crude oil in the subsurface. It occurs both as gas in the free gas cap above the oil and gas dissolved in the crude oil. It contains other hydrocarbon gases besides methane.

In some subsurface gas reservoirs, at high temperatures, shorter-chain liquid hydrocarbons, primarily those with five to seven carbon atoms in length, occur as a gas. When the gas is produced, the temperature decreases, and the liquid hydrocarbons condense out of the gas on the surface. This liquid, called condensate, is almost pure gasoline, is clear to yellowish to.

Bluish in color, and has 45 to 62°API gravities. Condensate is commonly called casinghead gasoline, drip gasoline, white gas, or natural gasoline. It is often added to crude oil in the field in a process called spiking to decrease the °API gravity and increase the volume and value of the oil. Condensate removed from natural gas in the field is classified as crude oil by regulatory agencies.

Because of the low octane, the posted price for condensate is usually slightly less than that for crude oil. Natural gas that contains condensate is called wet gas, whereas natural gas lacking condensate is called dry gas. The condensate along with butane, propane, and ethane that can be removed from natural gas are referred to as natural gas liquids (NGL.

It is usually 60°F and 14.65 psi (15°C and 101.325 kPa) and is called standard cubic feet (scf ). The abbreviation for 1,000 cubic feet is Mcf, a million cubic feet is MMcf, a billion cubic feet is Bcf, and a trillion cubic feet is Tcf. Condensate content is measured in barrels per million cubic feet (BCPMM) of gas. In the metric system, the volume of gas is measured in cubic meters (m3 ). A cubic meter is equal to 35.315 cf. The unit used to measure heat content of fuel such as gas in the English system is the British thermal unit (Btu). One Btu is about the amount of heat given off by burning one wooden match. Pipeline natural gas ranges from 900 to 1,200 Btus per cubic foot and is commonly 1,000 Btus. The heat content varies with the hydrocarbon composition and the amount of inerts in the natural gas. Heat content in the metric system is measured in kilojoules. A kilojoule of heat is equal to about 1 Btu. Natural gas is sold to a pipeline by volume in thousands of cubic feet, by the amount of heat when burned in Btus, or by a combination of both. If the pipeline contract has a Btu adjustment clause, the gas is bought at a certain price per Mcf, and the price is then adjusted for the Btu content of the gas. The amount of Btus in one average barrel of crude oil is equivalent to the Btus in 6,040 cubic feet of average natural gas and is called barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). Different companies often have a slightly different BOE numbers depending on the oil and gas composition of their production• 11 •.

Both black and volatile oils are liquid in the subsurface reservoir. Black oil or low-shrinkage oil has a relatively high percentage of long, heavy, nonvolatile molecules. It is usually black but can have a greenish or brownish color. Black oil has an initial producing GOR of 2,000 scf/bbl or less. The °API gravity is below 45.

Volatile oil or high-shrinkage oil has relatively more intermediate size molecules that are shorter than black oil molecules. The color is brown, orange, or green. Volatile oil has an initial producing GOR between 2,000 and 3,300 scf/bbl. The °API gravity is 40 or above. Retrograde gas is a gas in the reservoir under original pressure, but liquid condensate forms in the subsurface reservoir as the pressure decreases with production. The initial GOR is 3,300 scf/bbl or higher. Wet gas occurs entirely as a gas in the reservoir, even during production, but produces a liquid condensate on the surface. It often has an initial producing GOR of 50,000 scf/bbl or higher. Dry gas is pure methane. It.

Brines are subsurface waters that contain more salt than seawater (35–300 ppt). Brackish waters are mixtures of freshwaters and brines (1–35 ppt.

They are called boulder, cobble, pebble, granule, sand, silt, and clay-sized particles.

In some areas of the earth, there are no, or very few, sedimentary rocks, and the basement rock is on or near the surface. These areas are called shields, and there is no gas or oil.

A shield, such as the Canadian shield in eastern Canada, tends to be a large, low-lying area.

Ore minerals such as iron, copper, lead, zinc, gold, and silver are mined from the basement rock in shield areas.

There are about 600 sedimentary rock basins in the world. Of the basins that have been explored and drilled, about 40% are productive. About 90% of the world’s oil occurs in only 30 of those basins.

First is the number of cleavage surfaces of different directions. The second is the quality of the surfaces, such as poor or excellent. The third is the angle between the surfaces. Fracture is the breakage of the mineral along an irregular surface. The hardness of a mineral is quantified by Moh’s scale, which ranges from 1 to 10. The mineral talc is the softest (1), and diamond is the hardest (10). A mineral that is higher on Moh’s scale can scratch a mineral that is lower on the scale. Some common objects that are used for hardness comparisons are a fingernail (2.5), a copper penny (3.5), a knife or steel key (6), and glass (7). Specific gravity is the relative weight of a mineral compared to the weight of an equal volume of water. A specific gravity of 2.5 means the mineral weighs 2.5 times an equal volume of water. The specific gravity of an average rock or mineral is about 2.5. Ore minerals mined for metals, such as iron, copper, or nickel, are heavy and have specific gravities of 3.5 and above. Certain minerals have unique characteristics that can be used to identify them. The mineral halite (common table salt) can be identified by its taste. A very important test is the application of cold, dilute acid to a sample, which causes only the mineral calcite to bubble. a b Fig.3–1.Cleavage: (a) one perfect cleavage and (b) three perfect cleavages, not at right angles • 26 •.

Quartz is the hardest of the common minerals (7 on the Moh’s scale).

A foliated metamorphic rock has parallel, platy crystals (fig.3–2a). Nonfoliated metamorphic rock has either uniform-sized crystals or a nonparallel orientation of platy crystals (fig.3–2b).

Granite is the most common plutonic igneous rock. It has the coarsegrained texture characteristic of all plutonic rocks. Granite is composed of the minerals quartz, feldspar, biotite, and hornblende. Quartz grains are the most common, giving granite a light color (plate 3–2a). The dark-colored mineral grains give it a speckled texture. Some granites are reddish or pinkish from iron impurities. Granite is commonly used for building stone. Basalt is the most common volcanic rock. It has the fine-grained texture characteristic of lava. Basalt is black to gray in color (plate 3–2b). In some instances, the basalt coming out of a volcano cooled so rapidly that gas bubbles were frozen in the basalt. Fragments of basalt with numerous gas bubbles are called scoria.

A conglomerate is commonly deposited in a river channel or on an alluvial fan formed where a mountain stream empties into the desert. If the particles are angular, the rock is called breccia.

The darker the shale, the higher the organic content.

Black shales are common source rocks for gas and oil. A gray shale can be a caprock on a reservoir rock in a petroleum trap. Mudstone is similar to shale but is composed of both silt- and clay-sized grains.

Colored varieties of chert include jasper, chalcedony, and agate.

Many sedimentary rocks are a combination of these three types and are described as sandy, shaly, and limey or calcareous.

Petrified wood is formed by the replacement of wood by silicon dioxide, which preserves the grain structure of the wood. Trace fossils, such as burrows, tracks, or trails, are indirect evidence of ancient life.Fig.4–5. Fossils Certain species of plants and animals lived during certain geologic times. They eventually became extinct (disappeared from the earth) and were replaced by newer plants and animals. This continuous succession of organisms throughout geologic time is known as evolution. Vertical sequences of sedimentary rock layers that have been relative age dated can be used to determine the relative ages of the fossils in those rock layers (fig.4–6). Geologists have collected and established the relative ages of most fossils. The evolutionary sequence of the fossils can be used to relative age date any sedimentary rocks that contain those fossils. In figure 4–7, the rocks labeled A are older than those labeled B• 37 •.

Spores and pollens given off by plants to reproduce also are good microfossils. Scientists who study fossils are called paleontologists, and those who specialize in microfossils are micropaleontologists. Because they pick microfossils (bugs) from well cuttings to examine them under a microscope, they are often called bug pickers. Micropaleontologists specializing in spores and pollens are called palynologists or weed and seed people.

This extinction was caused when an asteroid made of rock hit the earth. It was at least 6 miles (10 km) in diameter and hit the earth head on with a speed of about 60,000 miles per hour (100,000 km/h).

Weathering, Erosion, and Unconformities.

A disconformity is an erosional channel in which the sedimentary rock layers above and below the erosional surface are parallel.

Angular unconformities can form gas and oil traps (fig.

Most anticlines and synclines are not level and are tilted with respect to the surface of the earth. These are called plunging anticlines (fig.5–8) and plunging synclines.

The formation of anticlines and synclines results in shortening of the earth’s crust (fig.5–10). Forces that shorten the earth’s crust are compressional.

Sedimentary rocks dipping uniformly in one direction are known as a homocline (fig.

Joint is a fracture in the rocks with no movement of one side relative to the other.

Any naturally fractured rock is a potential reservoir rock.

Faults are breaks in the rocks along which one side has moved relative to the other (plate.

Dip-slip faults move primarily up and down, whereas strike-slip faults move primarily horizontally.Oblique-slip faults have roughly equal dip-slip and strike-slip displacements.

If the hanging wall has moved down relative to the footwall, it is a normal dip-slip fault (fig.

Series of parallel, normal dip-slip faults forms a structure called horst and graben (fig.5–19). A graben is the down-dropped block between two normal faults. A horst is the ridge left standing between two grabens. These can range in size from inches to tens of miles across.Fig.5–19. Horst and graben If the hanging wall has moved up relative to the footwall, it is a reverse dip-slip fault. In a reverse dip-slip fault, some subsurface beds overlap.

Reverse dip-slip fault is formed by shortening the rocks with compressional forces (fig.5–22). When the earth’s crust is pulled apart, normal dip-slip faults with horsts and grabens are formed. When the earth’s crust is squeezed, reverse dip-slip and thrust faults and folds, such as anticlines and synclines, are formed.Fig.5–22. Forces that form a normal dip-slip fault and a reverse dip-slip fault Faults can be both active and inactive. When a fault moves, it can produce shock waves called an earthquake. Many faults, however, moved a long time ago and are inactive today. Two very large faults occur in Oklahoma, the Seneca and Nemaha faults. Both were active hundreds of millions of years ago but are inactive today.Dip-slip faults form traps by displacing the reservoir rock (fig.5–23). The fault must be a sealing fault, which means it prevents fluid flow across or along the fault. Any gas and oil migrating up a reservoir rock will be trapped under the sealing fault. The largest oil field on land in England is the Wytch Farm field, located southwest of London on the South Dorset coast. There are natural oil seeps along the coast, and the field was discovered in 1973. The trap was formed by a fault cutting the Sherwood Sandstone reservoir rock (fig.5–24). It contains 286 million bbl (45 million m3 ) of recoverable oil• 64 •.

Seaward of the continental shelf and slope break is the continental slope that extends down to the bottom of the ocean. It has a slope of about 3˚ and is the geological edge of the continents.

Submarine canyons are eroded, and sediments are transported down submarine canyons by turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are masses of water with suspended sediments such as sand, silt, and clay. The turbidity current is denser than the surrounding seawater and is pulled by gravity down the submarine canyon similar to river water being pulled by gravity down a river channel on land. Turbidity currents can originate from rivers with a large sediment load flowing into the ocean. Like rivers on land, they erode submarine canyons offshore.

Turbidity current will continue to flow down a submarine canyon as long as a slope exists. When the turbidity current flows onto the relatively flat ocean bottom, it stops, and the sediments settle out of the water. The coarsest sediments (usually sand) settle out first and the finest sediments (silt and then clay) settle out last. This deposits a graded bed (fig.6–3) with the coarsest sediments on the bottom and the finest on the top. Accumulations of turbidity current sediments at the base of a submarine canyon form a large sedimentary deposit called a submarine fan (fig.6–2). A channel usually leads out of the submarine canyon and divides into smaller distributary channels on the submarine fan.

The sands in turbidity current deposits are called turbidites and can be reservoirs (fig.6–4) for gas and oil. Relatively thin sandstones separated by shales are characteristic of submarine fan reservoirs deposited as graded beds. Relatively.

The deepest parts of the seafloor are ocean trenches that are long, narrow depressions usually located along the margins of the oceans. Adjacent to many deep ocean trenches are active volcanic islands.

The center of the ridge typically has a rift valley (graben.

Observations from submarines have shown that active basalt volcanoes occur all along the floor of the submerged graben on the crest of the mid-ocean ridge.

The average sediment thickness on the ocean bottom is about ½ mile (0.8 km). This is unevenly distributed. Sediments are very thick along the edge of the oceans in continental shelves and slopes and thin or absent on the mid-ocean ridge.

Because of lack of sedimentary rocks, no one will ever drill a well for gas or oil near the center of the ocean.

The crust of the earth under continents is granite in composition and is 20 to 45 miles (32 to 72 km) thick. The crust under oceans is basalt lava rock in composition and is only about 3 miles (5 km) thick.

The crust of the earth under continents is granite in composition and is 20 to 45 miles (32 to 72 km) thick. The crust under oceans is basalt lava rock in composition and is only about 3 miles (5 km) thick. Continents are high in elevation because they are composed primarily of granite that is relatively light in density compared.

The solid rock above the partially melted rocks is called the lithosphere (fig.6–9). It is about 90 miles (145 km) thick below continents and about 60 miles (97 km) thick below oceans.Fig.6–9. Cross section of the earth’s crust and lithosphere Continental Drift The theory of continental drift dates back to the early 1900s. It suggests that all the present-day continents were previously joined into one supercontinent, Pangaea (fig.6–10). During the early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago, Pangaea broke up. The fragments of the supercontinent drifted (moved) across the face of the earth into their present positions to form the modern continents. The theory was not widely accepted at first. It was not known what process would cause Pangaea to break up and the continents to move• 74 •.

The seafloor is spreading out from several mid-ocean ridges in different oceans. Areas where seafloors from two different mid-ocean ridges collide are called subduction zones. There are three types of subduction zones.First,.

Present, there are eight large plates and many smaller ones.

The modern day theory of plate tectonics, suggested in 1967, combines the ideas of seafloor spreading and continental drift. Plate tectonics postulates that the solid lithosphere of the earth is divided into large, moving plates (fig.6–16). Every location on the earth’s surface, whether a continent or a seafloor, is on a moving plate that is sliding across the partially molten rocks below it. Each plate originates at a mid-ocean ridge where new seafloor is being formed. The plate is moving at right angles away from the crest of the ridge at the spreading rate of that ridge. At the opposite side of the plate from the mid-ocean ridge is a subduction zone, an ocean trench, and/or a mountain range. Large strike-slip faults occur where different plates scrape against each other. Continents ride along on the moving plates.Fig.6–16. Cross section of plates At present, there are eight large plates and many smaller ones (fig.6–17). The North American Plate is moving to the west at 1 in/yr (2.5 cm/yr). Below California and off the west coast of the United States and Canada, the North American Plate is obliquely colliding with the Pacific Plate, • 79 •.

In the geologic past, the number and size of the plates have varied along with their rates and directions.

The initial breakup of a continent by plate tectonics can take the form of a triple junction. A triple junction has three rifts (arms) that join in the center (fig.6–19).Usually, two of the arms unite and continue rifting to form an ocean. The other arm stops spreading and is called a failed arm. A failed arm is a graben that can be filled with sediments.

Failed arms are oil and gas producers. During the Mesozoic breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea, several triple-junctions with failed arms formed. As North America separated from Europe, a triple junction formed near the present-day North Sea. Two arms joined to become the.

Several failed arms are oil and gas producers.

The large petroleum traps of the Middle East (fig.6–22) were formed by plate tectonics. Almost all the Middle East oil field traps are anticlines and domes. The mid-ocean ridge in the Red Sea (fig.6–8) is causing Saudi Arabia on the Arabian Plate to move northeastward and collide with the Eurasian Plate. The Persian Gulf area is being compressed between the two plates, forming the Middle East Field traps. The deformation becomes more intense in a northeastward direction from Saudi Arabia toward Iran and Iraq and forms the Zargos Mountains. Saudi Arabia alone has 85 fields with 325 reservoirs containing 25% of the world’s oil reserves. The Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia is the largest conventional oil field on earth. The trap is an anticline 174 miles (280 km) long and up to 18.6 miles (30 km) wide (fig.6–23a). The reservoir rock is fractured and dissolved limestone, the Jurassic age Arab D Limestone with an average oil pay zone of 200 ft (60 m). The reservoir rock is not very deep (−1,500 ft or −457 m below sea level). Salt layers in the overlying Hith Formation are the seal (fig.6–23b). The source rock is a Jurassic age black limestone. The average production of a Ghawar well is 11,400 bbl (1,800 m3 ) of oil per day, • 83 •.

And the field will eventually produce 82 billion bbl (13 billion m3 ) of oil. The oil is 32 to 36 ˚API gravity and has 1.7 to 2% sulfur.

A basin can be formed by subsidence of the basement rock.

Basins shows that the area was subjected to tensional forces that formed a series of parallel normal dip-slip faults with.

The city of Los Angeles is located on the Los Angeles basin.

The Los Angeles basin (fig.7–3) is the most prolific oil basin on earth. There are 61 oil fields that have produced over 9 billion bbl (1.4 billion m3 ) of oil.

Half-graben basins are formed by subsidence along one side of a normal fault (fig.7–4). These basins are common and are productive in the North Sea, offshore western Africa, and offshore Brazil• 88 •.

Most mountain ranges on land were formed by the compression of sedimentary rocks when plates collided (see figs.6–14 and 6–15 in chapter 6). They display large compressional features such as anticlines, synclines, reverse faults, and thrust faults. Mountain ranges, however, are relatively unproductive because most petroleum reservoirs have been breached by erosion, and the oil and gas have leaked out. In many areas, the sedimentary rocks have been eroded away, exposing the basement rock. Many of the remaining sedimentary rocks in the mountains have been metamorphosed by the high heat and pressure that occurred during the compression. Only intermontane basins, which form between mountain peaks, are good areas to explore for oil and gas. Intermontane basins form when mountain ranges are created. The basin is located between the mountain peaks and is often occupied by a lake. Algae growing in the lake contribute organic matter to the bottom sediments for source rocks.Streams, eroding the surrounding mountains, deposit numerous channel and beach sandstone reservoir rocks in the basin. When the Rocky Mountains were uplifted during the Cretaceous time, several intermontane basins were formed. Many of these basins, such as the Big Horn, Powder River, Green River, and Uinta basins, are good petroleum producers today (fig.7–5). Basins also form along the edges of mountains. As the mountains are eroded by streams, sediments fill in the areas adjacent to the mountains. The Alberta, Denver-Julesburg, and Raton basins formed in this manner• 90 •.

Coastal plains are formed by thick sediments deposited adjacent to an ocean (.

They originate when mountains are uplifted adjacent to a coast. As erosion lowers the mountains, streams deposit sands along the beaches, and waves carry the silts and clays offshore. The sandy beaches are deposited out into the ocean, forming the coastal plain. The Gulf of Mexico coastal plain was created by this process. Because the sediments on the surface are young and have never been buried, they are loose and uncemented (unconsolidated). The Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the United States were deposited by sediments eroded from the Appalachian and Ouachita mountains, which rose during the Pennsylvanian period. Underlying the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain is 40,000 to 60,000 ft (12,000 to 18,000 m) of sedimentary rocks. This area is one of the most prolific petroleum-producing areas of the world. The Atlantic coastal plain, however, is barren for gas and oil, possibly due to the lack of source rocks• 91 •.

All maps are oriented with north to the top, south to the bottom, east to the right, and west to the left.

If the contours are spaced relatively close together, the elevation is changing rapidly, and the slope is steep. If the contours are relatively far apart, the slope is gentle.

There are some important characteristics of contours on a topographic map. Contour lines never cross. Contour lines are single lines; they never branch. Contour lines are continuous; they always close or run off the map and never end on the map. Elevations can be accurately estimated from a topographic map. If a point is on the +300 ft contour, it must be, by definition, exactly 300 ft above sea level. If the point is about halfway between the +300 and +400 ft contour, an elevation of +350 ft is a good estimate. The shape of the contours is characteristic for many topographic features such as hills, ridges, and canyons. A topographic map (or any contoured map) cannot be drawn without some accurately surveyed points. After the elevations or values are located on a map (spotted), contours can be drawn between the points. Contouring • 100 •.

The basic sedimentary rock layer used for geologic mapping is called a formation.

Each formation has a two-part name. The first part is a town where the layer crops out on the surface. The second part is the dominant rock type, such as sandstone or limestone. San Andreas Limestone, Bartlesville Sandstone, and Barnett Shale are formation names.

The orientation of rock layers, the third dimension, is shown with a strike-and-dip symbol. Strike is the horizontal orientation of a plane (fig.8–6a), such as a sedimentary rock layer or a fault. It is measured with a compass orientation, such as north 30˚ east. Strike is shown as a short line on the geological map (fig.8–6b) that is oriented in the measured compass direction. Dip is the direction and vertical angle of the plane. It is measured perpendicular (90˚) to the strike (fig.8–6a). The dip symbol on the map is a small bar attached to the middle of the strike line (fig.8–6b). It points in the direction that the plane goes down into the earth. The angle in degrees is often on the dip symbol.

Base map is a map that shows the location of all the wells that have been drilled in an area.

The pay zone is the vertical distance in a well that produces gas and/or oil. Gross pay contours the entire reservoir.

Thickness including nonproductive water-bearing and shaly zones.

Shale.

Shale is the most common sedimentary rock, and many are black. A black shale commonly has 1 to 3% organic matter by weight and can have up to 20%.

It occurs from about 7,000 to 18,000 ft (2,100 to 5,500 m) deep on land.

The most common trap is a saturated pool, which always has a free gas cap on top of the oil reservoir (fig.9–4a). The oil in the reservoir has dissolved all the natural gas it can hold and is saturated. An unsaturated pool lacks a free gas cap (fig.9–4b). The oil has some dissolved gas, but it can hold more and is unsaturated. Sometimes there is only a gas reservoir on water.

The boundary in the reservoir between the free gas cap and the oil is the gas-oil contact (fig.9–5). The boundary between the oil and water reservoir is the oil-water contact. The gas-oil and oil-water contacts are either relatively sharp or gradational and are usually level. The top of the trap is called the crest. The.

Leak onto the surface. Two common caprocks are shales and salt layers.Well-cemented or shaly rocks, very-fine-grained limestone (micrite or chalk), and permafrost can also be caprocks.

Giant oil field has at least 500 million bbl of recoverable oil, and a super giant has at least 5 billion bbl of recoverable oil. A giant gas field has at least 3 Tcf of recoverable gas, and a supergiant gas field has at least 20 Tcf of recoverable gas.

Natural gas compresses and needs less porosity than an oil reservoir. Very deep gas reservoirs need very little porosity because of the very high pressure.

Primary pores are formed on the surface when the sediments are deposited, for example, between the sediment grains. Secondary pores are formed in the subsurface by processes such as solution and fracturing.

The only way to make a quantitative permeability measurement is to drill a core of the reservoir rock and cut a plug. The plug is dried to remove any liquids. An instrument called a permeameter is used to measure the permeability of the dried plug by measuring the flow of air or nitrogen through it. Typical permeability values of an oil reservoir rock are given in table 9–2. Gas is about 50 times more fluid than oil and needs less permeability than an oil reservoir• 121 •.

A constructive delta (fig.10–12a) is shaped by river deposition. Wave erosion is relatively minor. A constructive delta has lobes of sediments that protrude into the ocean. The Mississippi River Delta is an example. A destructive delta (fig.10–12b) is shaped by wave erosion. It.

The Niger River Delta is one of the world’s greatest oil-producing areas, with more than 41 billion bbl (6.5 billion m3 ) of recoverable oil in ancient beach and river channel sandstones.Fig.10–19. Map of present-day and ancient shorelines and their ages on the Niger River Delta, Nigeria.(Modified from Burke, 1972. ) Granite Wash Granite wash is a potential reservoir rock formed by the weathering of granite. The rock granite is composed of large, well-sorted, sand-sized mineral grains and weathers to form well-sorted sandstone that can be very thick. After the granite and granite wash have been buried in the subsurface, oil and gas can form in source rocks at a lower elevation. The oil and gas can then migrate up and into the granite wash (fig.10–20). Granite wash reservoir rocks are common in the subsurface of southern and western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. The Elk City field of Oklahoma produces from granite wash where it has been uplifted by an anticline.

A limestone platform is a large area covered with shallow tropical seas where limestones are being deposited.

As it flows over the limestone platform, calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water forming sand- and silt-sized spheres called oolites. Limestones.

Composed of oolites are called oolitic limestones. They have excellent original porosity and can be good reservoir rock.

Dolomite is difficult to distinguish from limestone in the field. Dolomite and limestone have a similar crystal shape, color, and hardness. Limestone will bubble in cold, diluted acid.Dolomite, however, will bubble only in hot, concentrated acid.Rhomb-shaped crystals that will not bubble in cold, diluted acid are the best field indication of dolomite. In.

The faults can sometimes be barriers to fluid flow and are called sealing faults.

The contacts are at different elevations in the same reservoir rock on opposite.

Oil-water and gas-oil contacts in reservoirs are level. If the contacts are at different elevations in the same reservoir rock on opposite sides of the fault, the fault is a sealing fault. If there are different fluid pressures at the same elevation on opposite sides of the fault, the fault is a sealing fault.

In an area where large volumes of loose sediments are rapidly deposited, such as deltas and coastal plains, a unique type of fault, a growth or downto-the-basin fault, forms. The fault is always parallel to and located just inland from the shoreline (.

Is called a growth fault because it moves as the sediments are being deposited.

Growth faults are unique in that they have a curved fault plane that is concave toward the basin.

The fault is steep near the surface and becomes less steep with depth.

Faults in solid rocks tend to have straight fault planes. The growth fault, however, occurs in loose sediments.

Drag folds are formed by friction generated along a fault plane when a fault moves. Friction causes the beds on either side of the fault to be dragged up on one side and down on the other side of the fault.

Compressional features such as folds, reverse faults, and thrust faults. The thrust faults occur in zones called overthrust or disturbed belts that parallel the mountain ranges. The most drilled of these overthrust belts is the Rocky Mountain or Western overthrust or disturbed belt of the United States and Canada (fig.11–15). Thrust faulting occurred from the Cretaceous through Eocene time during the formation of the mountains. A west-to-east cross section shows the deformation of the earth’s crust (fig.11–16). Several of the thrust faults moved tens of miles horizontally. In Wyoming and Utah, the 1,000 ft (305 m) thick Jurassic age Nugget Sandstone has been deformed into large subsurface drag folds along the thrust faults. These are the targets for Rocky Mountain overthrust drilling. The Painter reservoir field, Wyoming, discovered in 1977, is a typical overthrust field. A more detailed, east-west cross section (fig.11–17) shows the numerous thrust faults and the drag fold trap in the Nugget Sandstone at 10,000 ft (3,050 m) below the surface. A larger-scale, east-west cross section of the field (fig.11–18) shows more faulting and the complex deformation in more detail. The oil and gas pay zone is more than 770 ft (235 m) thick• 167 •.

The location of drag folds in the subsurface cannot be predicted from rock outcrops on the surface because of the intense deformation.

There are two areas for drilling on salt domes (fig.11–39). Above the salt dome, any shallow reservoir rocks such as sandstones are domed. Near the top of the salt dome, uplift has caused the overlying sedimentary rocks to be faulted with normal faults that sometimes form grabens. These form fault traps. Because the caprock is often fractured and porous, it can be productive reservoir rock. Deep along the flanks of the salt dome, reservoir rocks that were uplifted.

Drillers selected the drillsites while envisioning large, flowing underground rivers and subterranean crevasses filled with oil. Geologists.

Drillers selected the drillsites while envisioning large, flowing underground rivers and subterranean crevasses filled with oil. Geologists were seldom used to select drillsites. Once an oil field was discovered, the “closeology” principle applied. The closer a proposed well was to a producing well, the better the proposed well was.

Two criteria must be met on a structural map to locate a drillsite. It must be a high area on the reservoir rock, and it must have four-sided closure. If the reservoir rock is filled with water, then any gas or oil, being lighter than water, will migrate to the high area in the reservoir rock.Four-sided closure means that the trap (high area) goes down on all four sides.

The trap can be filled down to a level, called the spill point, at which it cannot hold any more.

Is the highest point on the rim of an anticline or dome. The vertical distance from the crest of the reservoir rock down to the spill point is the closure of the trap.

Constructing a cross section, a vertical slice or panel of the subsurface rocks, by correlation is used to find gas and oil traps. Correlation is the matching of rock layers from one well to another.

Marker bed is a distinctive rock layer that is easy to identify. Volcanic ash layers; thin beds of coal, limestone, or sandstone; and fossil zones are good marker beds.

Fence diagram is used to show how wells correlate in three dimensions (fig.12–9). The diagram is arranged like a map. North is at the top, south at the bottom, east to the right, and west to the left. Each well is located (spotted) on the map. The well log for each well is drawn vertically under the well’s position. The rock layers are then correlated from one well log to another. Each set of correlations forms a panel. The entire diagram is called a fence diagram• 202 •.

With sequence stratigraphy, correlation between wells log is made using unconformities rather than rock layers.

It recognizes that unconformities, ancient erosional surfaces, represent an instant of geological time. These unconformities were formed when sea level was relatively low and the land was exposed to erosion during the cyclic rise and fall of sea level (see chap.2, fig.2–7). The rocks between two unconformities were deposited during a specific interval of time called a parasequence set. This corresponds to the fourth-order cycle of sea level rise and fall. Parasequence sets can be subdivided into smaller time interval units bounded by smaller unconformities called parasequences that correspond to the fifth-order cycles of sea level rise and fall. Geologists can better predict where source rocks and reservoir rocks are located in parasequence sets and parasequences (fig.12–10) than they can using traditional rock formations. A lot of subsurface information from wells, no matter who drilled them, eventually becomes public. A company drilling an exploratory well in a new area might want to keep as much information as secret as possible by running a tight hole. The information can then be used by the tight hole operator to locate other wellsites and leasing any land that is still open (loose acreage).However, state, provincial, and federal laws require that a specific suite of well logs be released to the government regulatory agency within a certain time. This time limit varies; it is one year in the states of Oklahoma and Texas. For US offshore federal land, it is 5 or 10 years. After being released to the government, these logs immediately become public information. In many countries, there is a national oil company that partners with any foreign oil company drilling in that country. Because the foreign oil companies have a common partner in the national oil company, well information can be obtained through that source• 204 •.

The rocks between two unconformities were deposited during a specific interval of time called a parasequence set.

The API assigns a 10- or 12-digit number called the API number to every well drilled in the United States. Digits 1 and 2 are state codes; digits 3 through 5 are for county, parish, or offshore; digits 6 through 10 identify the well; and digits 11 and 12 record a well property such as sidetracking.

Vitrinite reflectance is a method used to determine the maturity of a source rock. Vitrinite is a type of plant organic matter often found in black shale.

Play is a combination of trap, reservoir rock, and seal that has been shown by previously discovered fields to contain commercial petroleum deposits in an area.

Trend or fairway is the area along which the play has been proven and more fields could be found.

Prospect is the exact location where the geological and economic conditions are favorable for drilling an exploratory well. A prospect can be presented by using prospect maps that illustrate the reasoning for selecting that drilling location.

Location. The maps include at least a structure and isopach map of the drilling target and a map of test results and fluid recoveries from wells in the area. An economic analysis of the prospect should include reserves and risk calculations. There are four major geological factors (essential elements) in the success of a particular prospect.First, there must have been a source rock that generated petroleum.Second, there must be a reservoir rock to hold the petroleum.Third, there must be a trap. This includes a reservoir rock configuration that has four-sided closure, a seal on the reservoir rock, and no breach of the trap.Fourth, the timing must be right. The trap had to be in position before the petroleum migrated through the area. Geologists have put together petroleum systems for all petroleumproducing areas of the world. A petroleum system is a volume of sedimentary rocks that includes a source rock that is or has generated oil and gas and all the seeps and accumulations of that oil and gas. It can be an entire basin or part of a basin. The essential elements that include source rock, reservoir rock, seal, and overlying sediments in that petroleum system are identified. The timing of processes that include trap formation and petroleum generation, migration, and accumulation for that petroleum system are determined. The petroleum system is named after the source rock and reservoir rock such as the Mandal-Ekofisk petroleum system of the North Sea and the Akata-Agbada petroleum system of the Niger River Delta of Nigeria• 209 •.

The gravity meter does not work well in either an airplane or the ocean because of vibrations.

Amplitude versus offset (AVO) is an analysis of seismic data to locate gas reservoirs and help identify the composition of the rock layers. Offset is the distance between the seismic source and the receiver. The amplitude of a reflection usually decreases with increasing offset distance. Gas reservoirs and different sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, limestones, and shales have different reflection amplitudes versus offsets. Some increase, and others decrease with offset.

Investment (ROI) and payout (PO). Return on investment is the net revenue from oil and gas production sales.

Two common methods of evaluating a drilling prospect are return on investment (ROI) and payout (PO). Return on investment is the net revenue from oil and gas production sales divided by the maximum cash outlay for drilling and completion. Because money is spent immediately for drilling and completion and the revenue from oil and gas production sales is spread out over many years after that, the time value of money must be considered by discounting. Tables with an annual discount rate are used to determine what the present value of the money is when received at a later date. For example, $100 of net oil and gas production revenue 10 years from now at a discount rate of 15% is worth only $24.72 in present value today. Present value is used in the ROI calculation that is then multiplied.

The economic value of drilling a prospect can also be evaluated by the internal rate of return (IRR). It is the investment rate, such as 20%, that applied to the cost of drilling and completing a well will equal the net revenue interest from oil and gas production sales over the life of the well. Some companies set a minimum IRR before drilling is approved. If the drilling project does not meet that minimum IRR, the money can be better spend on another investment.

The start of drilling a well is called spudding in. Spudding in a medium or deep well usually begins with a small truck-mounted rig that drills a largediameter but shallow hole (20 to 100 ft or 7 to 30 m) called the conductor hole.

If the tower comes on a tractor-trailer and is jacked up as a unit, it is a mast.

The derrick or mast is the steel tower directly above the well that supports the crown block at the top and provides support.

For the drillpipe to be stacked vertically as it is pulled from the well.

If the tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick.

If the tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick. All offshore rigs use derricks. Derricks and masts are commonly 80 to 187 ft (24.4 to 57 m) tall to accommodate two, three, or four joints of vertical drillpipe in a stand. They have a square cross section with four vertical legs made of structural steel. The horizontal structural members between the legs are called girts (fig.15–4). The diagonal members are braces. An inverted, V-shaped opening in the front of the derrick or mast called the V-door allows drillpipe and casing to be pulled up the pipe ramp onto the drill floor. Derricks and masts are rated for maximum drillpipe load. They are also rated for wind load and can commonly withstand winds of 100 to 130 miles per hour (160 to 208 km/hr). The base of the mast or derrick is a flat, steel surface called the drill, derrick, or rig floor, where most of the drilling activity occurs. Two substructures made of a steel framework 10 to 30 ft (3 to 10 m) high can be used to raise the drill floor above the ground (plate 15–1). This is done to provide space for wellhead equipment below the drill floor such as the blowout preventers (BOPs) when drilling a deep well• 251 •.

The tower is erected vertically on the site, it is a derrick. All offshore rigs use derricks.

The next joint of drillpipe used to make a connection (fig.15–9a) is kept in a hole in the drill floor called the mouse hole.

A stabilizer is a common sub (fig.15–11) that uses blades to contact the well walls. It is designed to keep the drillstring central in the well. A vibration dampener or shock sub uses rubber, springs, or compressed gas to absorb vibrations from the bit. It is usually run just above the bit. A bit sub is used to make the connection between a bit and the drill collar or sub above it. A crossover sub is used to make a connection between two different sizes of pipe or two different thread types. A hole opener (fig.15–12) uses roller cones to enlarge the wellbore. A reamer has three or six tungsten steel rollers along its sides and is often run above the bit to provide a gauge hole. A gauge hole is a hole with a specific minimum diameter. The.

This bit is designed to continuously shear away the rocks to produce cuttings.

A worn bit can be detected from the change in noise that the drillpipe makes from the drill floor and by a decrease in rate of penetration.

The pipe is usually pulled and unscrewed three joints (a tribble) at a time, and is called a stand.

The rate of temperature increase is called the geothermal gradient. It averages 2°F/100 ft (3.6°C/100 m) for the earth but varies between 0.5° to 5°F/100 ft (1° to 9°C/100 m).

Jar is often used in the fishing string above the tool. The jar is a section of pipe that either mechanically or hydraulically imparts a sharp upward or downward jolt to the tool on command (fig.16–4). Explosives can be used to blow up the junk. The pieces are then retrieved with a magnet or junk basket.

Mechanical pipe sticking is often caused by a dogleg in the well. A dogleg is any deviation in the well greater than 3˚ per 100 ft.(30 m). Doglegs are caused by drilling through dipping hard rock layers or a change in the weight on the bit during drilling. A dogleg can result in keyseating, the formation of a wellbore cross section in the form of a key hole (fig.16–5). It is caused by the drillpipe abrading a groove in the side of the well that is smaller that the hole drilled by the bit. Larger diameter drill collars cannot pass through the keyseat. The well has to be enlarged by reamers. Ledges are hard rock layers that ring the wellbore and can cause pipe sticking. They are formed when drilling through alternating layers of hard and soft rocks. The soft rock washes out above and below the hard rock layers to form ledges. A stuck-point indicator tool or stuck-pipe log can be run to determine exactly where (stuck point) the pipe is stuck. A back-off operation is performed as a last resort. The stuck pipe can be cut with either a string shot or a chemical cutter. A string shot uses an explosive cord that is detonated one joint above the stuck point while the pipe is being unscrewed. A chemical cutter (fig.16–6) is run on a wireline and activated by an electrical signal. It uses a chemical propellant, a hot, corrosive fluid that jets out of the cutter under high pressure to slice through the pipe. After the pipe is cut, a washpipe (fig.16–3c) is then run on a fishing string to wash around the stuck pipe and detach it from the well wall. Wall sticking can be prevented by using spiral-grooved drill collars (fig.16–7). The three grooves, located 120˚ apart, decrease the area of pipe in contact with the well walls but have little effect on the weight and strength of the pipe• 283 •.

The first device used to kick off a well was a whipstock.

Horizontal wells are also used in low-permeability (tight) formations to increase ultimate recovery from the reservoir. They are also used to prevent coning, which produces excessive gas or water from above or below the oil reservoir (chapter 24.

Completing a well usually costs more money than drilling a well.

A core, a cylinder of rock drilled from the well, is the most accurate source of information about the reservoir. A full-diameter core ranges in diameter from 1¾ to 5¼ in.(4.4 to 13.3 cm) and can be up to 400 ft (122 m) long but is commonly 20 to 90 ft (6.1 to 27.4.m) long.

As a general rule, in an 8-in.(20-cm) hole, it takes about 10 minutes for mud to circulate each 1,000 ft (305 m.
