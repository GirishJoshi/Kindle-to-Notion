In the adult world, an uneven distribution of abilities is more valuable than mediocrity at everything.

‘Are you sure you don’t need me to come up?’ she said. In conversation, it is impolite to say, ‘Refer previous answer,’ so I repeated, ‘I need to assess the situation first.’.

Resilience appeared to be the equivalent of toughening up, which, when I was a child, was a general excuse for bullying.

‘Your dad would say not conventionally attractive, which is a good way of putting it, because what people think is attractive is not the same everywhere. In some cultures, being overweight is considered attractive.’.

They had invited Rosie and me to drinks, which Rosie refused, on the basis that she needed to wash her hair. Hair-washing was a standard excuse for avoiding Gene, whom she considered a misogynist pig.

Black T-shirt with the slogan Autistic Lives Matter.

‘And punishments. Remembering that withholding a reward is punishment too. You’re using ABA, right?’.

‘I’m not a person with autism any more than I’m a person with lesbianism. I’m lesbian. I’m autistic. When I get a cold, I have a cold; I’m a person with a cold and I want to get rid of it. Medical help appreciated. But being autistic and lesbian—that’s who I am, and I’m not interested in anyone trying to cure me of who I am.

Medical help appreciated. But being autistic and lesbian—that’s who I am, and I’m not interested in anyone trying to cure me of who I am. If they force me into conversion therapy—because that’s what ABA is—for being lesbian or for being autistic, they’re abusing me. If they do it to a child, they’re abusing that child.’.

Imagine everyone used wheelchairs except you and society was designed to accommodate them. You’d knock your head on door frames and have to ask for a chair at restaurants. I thought of Hudson and the ski boots.

‘Correct, but what you said was so spectacular that I may have forgotten it.’.

Facilitators generally think that finishing with applause is more important than completing the agenda.

You’re either autistic or neurotypical.

Diagnosis is for diseases.’.

‘Neither. I consider tribalism one of the worst aspects of human behaviour. A major contributor to confirmation bias, lack of innovation in public policy, war…’.

‘People don’t always mention their motivations. They don’t always know them. That’s why I have a job.’.

Cause célèbre.

Take my mind off my own life.’.

It was the equivalent of me accepting unhappiness now because life would improve after the age of eighty-one.

If I knew then what I know now.

Religious and political positions presented as fact;.

We admit it—Donald Tillman is right. We will abolish the hair-length specification, remove God from the school prayer and make Donald head boy.

Negotiating with a justifiably angry and emotionally unstable eleven-year-old to separate him from time with his mother while not revealing that his preferred outcome would cost her the job she had travelled across the world to take.

I retrieved the ratchet from its case and demonstrated its use, along with the relative advantages of socket, open, ring and adjustable spanners.

One of my teachers had presented Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If’ as a specification for manhood, with its claim that a fully configured male should be willing not only to gamble but to wager his entire pile of winnings on a single event with a fifty per cent probability of success. Then and now, Kipling seemed to be describing a personality fault that would warrant professional intervention. Rosie would not have responded to such recklessness on my part by complimenting me on my manliness.

Rational people, if they have all the information and the brainpower to process it, should reach similar conclusions.

Rational people, if they have all the information and the brainpower to process it, should reach similar conclusions. But science is so complex that most of us are forced to rely on authorities. The theory that pharmaceutical companies would cover up side effects to promote vaccines is plausible.’.

If someone tells you that their dog has died, the appropriate response is to say you’re sorry to hear that and ask about their feelings rather than to demand details of the circumstances.

People with autism often have poor physical co-ordination.

As a teenager, I had been given the relevant facts, primarily by other children and often in the context of jokes, but had somehow failed to absorb them, and was left confused and disgusted.

‘Pa wants me to remember him every time I see affect or effect used incorrectly.’.

‘Remember when you let that little disabled boy win the karate tournament? Your father was so proud of you.’.

My father would probably have assessed that I appreciated his help, but my co-operation was motivated by my desire for his approval.

Was pleased with my analysis but unhappy with the conclusion.

I had continued to reflect on my feelings about my father trying to mould me into something that he considered desirable. He was, in retrospect, largely right, but emotionally—meaning irrationally—I had resented it. If Hudson was in the same position, I would be wasting my time trying to convince him of the value of the skills I was teaching him. I had learned, reluctantly and over many years, that rational argument seldom overcame irrational resistance.

‘Correct. Gay men are famous for their expertise in style and etiquette, even for straight people.’.

I had not planned to do so, but the idea seemed good, except that Rosie had just rejected it.

Resilience, in my experience, was seldom the reason to do anything. It was only ever stated as a goal after some action that required it had occurred or been committed to.

But…well…change is a fact of life, isn’t it, so maybe the move will help to build his resilience. But that’s not the reason.’ Resilience, in my experience, was seldom the reason to do anything. It was only ever stated as a goal after some action that required it had occurred or been committed to.

‘I can’t understand how someone with all your brains didn’t have enough common sense’.

The process for problem-solving is first to explain and explore the situation and objectives. We can ask questions and share information, but we can’t propose solutions. Then we require an incubation period for subconscious problem-solving, during which we undertake some mundane activity. As we have only one day total, I recommend we allow three to four hours. Then we co-operate on finding solutions.’.

As I had on every anniversary, I gave Rosie a gift according to the published schedule: year thirteen was lace. Hence high-quality running shoes with laces.

‘He’s in danger of becoming an entrepreneur. A capitalist.’.

I might not have seen beyond the rule that promises were not to be broken.

‘Lack of empathy for people different from him. Few people are mean on purpose.’.

Because that’s what we do when someone talks about the things we’re afraid of ourselves. Get them first before they get us.

The gentleman shared a bit of personal information that might have been embarrassing to him, and everybody laughed. Because that’s what we do when someone talks about the things we’re afraid of ourselves. Get them first before they get us.

The gentleman shared a bit of personal information that might have been embarrassing to him, and everybody laughed. Because that’s what we do when someone talks about the things we’re afraid of ourselves. Get them first before they get us. ‘So, we got him. We all laughed. But it didn’t mean we didn’t like him. We’re thinking, now if I share what I’m worried or embarrassed about—not with a whole room of people, because we’re not all as brave as this gentleman, but with a good friend—it won’t be such a big deal.

They’ll still like me, even if they laugh. And I think everyone here would be a bit happier trusting this gentleman with something personal, because he went first. Give him another round of applause, please.’.

The eye. I should have recognised the.

I should have recognised the situation from my own experiences at school, when victims of bullying did not report it, because the intervention by the authorities would be short-term, but they would continue to encounter the bully daily.

You should run the second half faster than the first. It’s easier to catch up than to try to keep a lead.’.

‘Steady pace is best, with a sprint at the end. But going slow at the start is better than going fast. You should run the second half faster than the first. It’s easier to catch up than to try to keep a lead.’.

None of us is expert in all situations. It is a sign of intelligence to recognise our limitations and of maturity to seek help when required.

‘Altruism. Performing an act because of its intrinsic merit rather than any benefit to yourself. Such as making a donation to charity. An anonymous one.’.

‘Two was that your parents and teachers know heaps more than you do, but they don’t know everything. That’s a problem when you’re a kid and you’re not sure about something important. You have to do research and then decide.

Hudson was right about me not caring about being called ‘weird’. But, despite the term having been used by others in the past year to describe Hudson, I had never thought of him as actually weird—possibly because we might both be weird along the same dimensions.

If Hudson had studied martial arts, he would have known what to do, which was to run away.

‘I’ve already told him it was great,’ said Rosie. ‘So have Dave and Sonia and George and your mother, and I’ve told him that Phil thought it was worth going to hospital for. Your son got virtually a standing ovation, but he’d like to hear from his father as well.’.

For some people, it mattered not only that an initiative was effective, but that the feelings behind it met with their approval.

For some people, it mattered not only that an initiative was effective, but that the feelings behind it met with their approval. These were the people who considered Mother Teresa’s contribution to addressing poverty more important than that of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
