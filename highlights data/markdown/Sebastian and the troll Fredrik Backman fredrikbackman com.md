But Sebastian’s darkness is not just a light switch that someone forgot to flip, not just a pill he doesn’t want to take.

He can’t sleep at night. Sometimes his parents can’t either. He can see their tears run slowly down the outside of the glass then, they sound like rain over rooftops. Sebastian knows that his parents wish that something awful had happened to him. Because then there’d be a reason for him to hurt. Then he could be understood, maybe even fixed. But Sebastian’s darkness is not just a light switch that someone forgot to flip, not just a pill he doesn’t want to take.

”What are you writing on the notes?” Sebastian asks. ”Your name”, the troll answers. ”Why?” ”So that you don’t forget that you are somebody.” Sebastian doesn’t know what to reply to that. So he says: ”Nice pen.” ”It’s the most beautiful pen I know, I always carry it with me because I want them to know that I love them”, the troll says. ”Who?” ”The letters.” Sebastian’s fingertips touch the glass of the bubble. ”How did you get in here?” he asks. ”I didn’t get in, I got out”, the troll says and stretches sleepily. ”From what?” ”From you. Through one of the cracks.” ”I’ve cracked?”.

Sebastian’s fingers fumble over his stomach. His throat. His face. Small, tiny cracks everywhere. They don’t hurt. Sebastian thinks that maybe he’s forgotten how to do it, how to hurt in places where other people hurt, in all the normal ways. Burn-your-hand-on-a-hot-pan-ways. Stub-your-toe-on-furniture-ways. Now he only hurts in weird ways. Ways-that-don’-t leave-a-scar-ways. Ways-that-can’t-bee-seen-on-an-x-ray-ways.

”I can’t teach you how to make it stop hurting, Sebastian.” ”Then what can you teach me?” Sebastian breathes in reply. ”How to fight.” ”Fight against what?” ”Against everybody that’s coming tonight.” ”Who?” ”Your nightmares. Your weaknesses. Your inadequacies. Your monsters.” And at night, they come. All of them.

Every monster from under every bed and every creature from the darkest rooms inside his head.

”I mean that sometimes you think you’re sure of something, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t be wrong. You could for example see a balloon and be sure that someone dropped it, but it might actually have run away.”.

”What do we do now?” ”Sleep”, the troll suggests. ”Why?” the boy asks. ”Because sometimes when you wake up there’s breakfast.”.

”What’s up there?” he asks and points to the top of the cliffs where the rope is attached. ”A life. A hundred thousand years of all the best and all the worst”, the troll whispers. ”And in-between that?” The troll smiles, almost happily. ”Oh, yes! THAT! All the in-between. You get to choose that. The best and the worst in life just happens to us, but the in-between… that’s what keeps us going.” Sebastian’s breath bounces around in his throat. ”Will you come with me?” ”Yes. We’ll all come with you.” Sebastian’s face crumples up like confused laundry. ”Who’s ’we’?” ”We”, the troll repeats. When Sebastian looks out over the beach he sees a hundred thousand trolls. ”Who are they?” The troll hugs.

One day when someone says something and maybe he laughs for the first time. Or when he laughs as if it were the first time, over and over again. Laughs as if someone a very, very long time ago found the laugh on the ground in a forest, broken to pieces after a storm, and brought it home and nursed it until the laugh was strong enough to be released into the wild again. And then it takes off from the rooftops, straight up towards the heavens, as if someone let go of a balloon to make it happy. Maybe, in a hundred thousand years.
