This book will address the single most common misconception of the Information Age: that Google is the be-all and end-all of research.

“The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution.”.

But don’t throw your hands up in frustration and disgust just yet. Instead, let’s recast that open-ended question into a series of factual questions that you can answer. How much did CEO Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems earn in 2007? What was the average salary paid to the chief executive officers at the ten largest computer companies in the past five years? Who is an expert on computer industry compensation whom I can interview and quote? What books can I consult that discuss compensation trends in the software industry?.

As I’ll show in later chapters, you can answer these factual questions by searching public records databases, scrutinizing library catalogs, talking to associations, and conducting in-depth Google searches.

So how do you turn those hazy, unanswerable, open-ended questions into something you can work with? To determine exactly what someone is looking for, professional librarians conduct a reference interview. A reference interview is the formal process by which an answerable question is extracted from a general description of what a person is looking for.

The lawyer was asking for what he thought he needed—the annual report, the proxy, and the quarterly report—rather than for what he actually needed, which was a discrete piece of information contained in precisely none of the documents he asked me to send to him.

You should start, instead, by asking a series of factual questions: When was the digital camera invented? Which professional photographers used to photograph with film cameras and now shoot in digital? What companies produce digital cameras? What difference does it make if you produce a photo using software rather than a traditional chemical darkroom? What do experts in the field think about the shift from film to pixels?.

Observe the rule that professionals follow: Never compile information yourself if someone else has already done it.

Putting together a list of manufacturers is exactly the type of information that a manufacturers association would collect and make public.

The oldest joke in the research world is to tell a patron, “I can get it for you fast, cheap, and accurate. Pick two.”.

Traditional newspapers, broadcast news, and mainstream websites take pains to build their reputations for credibility. That’s why they hire fact checkers and copy editors and reporters who take care to get their information straight.

“A lie can travel halfway round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes”.

It is not an opinion that the sky is blue; it’s a fact—a fact as verifiable in Russia as it is in Uruguay and Canada.

The excitement of research comes when a little bit of knowledge leads to even more, and one of the best secrets of good research is the ability to use one bit of information (or document or website or article or name) to find even more information.

Footnotes, callouts, and references to other works are the hidden gems that researchers should read as closely as the primary text. Don’t ignore them.

If the person quoted in an article has an opinion that you either like, want to challenge, or need to learn more about, note his or her affiliation. You might find additional information on the person’s company, university, or association site.

Most websites and blogs offer additional links or blog rolls. Check them out. If the webmaster sees value in adding a link, there likely is something of value to you in following it.

Always ask for more information: Whether you are speaking to a person face-to-face or are engaged in an email conversation, never fail to ask where else you should be looking for additional information. People love to talk; you’ll find that asking for advice can produce tips for finding more information quickly.

Resist the urge to Google everything. As you’ll see in the next chapter, not only is Google quite limited in the information that it can provide but a strict reliance on Google cuts you off from the expertise of people with whom you can have a conversation. Picking up the phone to speak with the right person can sometimes get you an answer faster than even the fastest computer can.

When you’re looking for information, keep in mind that everything is guilty until proven truthful. Skepticism (not cynicism) is the ally of the researcher. You should always weigh the credibility of any source in light of what you already know and never take a fact, opinion, or conclusion at face value until you can verify it.

“If he says his mother loved him, check it out with her.”.

They didn’t nickname the lions in front of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue Patience and Fortitude for nothing. Tenacity is as much a tool of successful research as curiosity and intelligence.

Does this author know what the heck she is talking about? Is this information accurate? Is it free from bias? If the author is making a point, does the reasoning hold up or does the author make specious claims? Has care been taken to write clearly and grammatically? In short, reading through a list of Google results is first and foremost an exercise in making choices about which results promise to answer your questions and which should be dismissed as unworthy of your attention.

From a giant blind spot concerning the deep web. The term deep web refers to the universe of web-accessible information locked away in databases where Google’s spidering computers can’t see it. That limitation is a very serious knock against Google and the most important reason for never depending on it exclusively for online information.

Web design matured. Most sites were designed to pull information from a database. No longer were sites created from hard-coded text. Instead, they produced information on the fly, pulled from a database, in response to user queries. Suddenly, search engines didn’t look as omnipotent as they once did. These days, the bulk of the interesting data is in the database, not on a web page where Google’s computers can find it.

In Googlespeak, a space between search terms is always interpreted as the word and.

“The richest person in the world—in fact all the riches in the world—couldn’t provide you with anything like the endless, incredible loot available at your local library.”.

An old joke holds there are three types of people in the world: those who can count and those who can’t.

Twelve responses to my question. “It’s boustrophedonic!”.

If you want to convince a large oil company to stop drilling in the middle of dolphin breeding grounds, it would be helpful to have a source for the company’s legal name, state of incorporation, mailing address, and the correct spelling of the CEO’s name.

Few things are truly hidden anymore. It was romantic once to know about something that no else did, like a rare jazz record or an undiscovered gem of a book.
