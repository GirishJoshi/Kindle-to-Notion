Work on simple and well-known strategies, but adjust them over time to complement your own personality and whatever the current market conditions are. Success in trading is not a revolution; it is an evolution.

Simply reading books will, of course, not make you a profitable trader. Profits in trading do not come from reading one or two, or even a dozen books, but, as I explain, profits can come with practice, the right tools and software, and proper ongoing education.

There are many firms, educators, traders and even online scammers who develop these types of computer programs and systems and sell them to traders.

However, because the discretionary trader must make a decision for each trade, traders are more prone to emotional trading and acts of self-deception, such as falling in love with a trade, that will often result in a failure to follow their trading plan.

I'm always saying that trading is a career and a business. And in no career and in no business can you become profitable in just three months. Look at doctors, lawyers and engineers. They go to school for years and take examinations and serve internships and practice, and practice some more, before they can truly call themselves professionals. They are all long and challenging processes that take considerably more than three months.

Typical education cost for a trader is between $1,000 to $2,000 including several months of practice trading in a simulator.

An education or training program is an investment that you make, and maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. If it doesn't, it's not the end of the world for you.

Knowing how to manage expectations is extremely important, especially for beginner traders.

My desire is to try to save traders from themselves.

When our ancestors originally studied the sky above them, they saw what appeared to be a random mass of stars. As they continued.

This means that recognizing trade patterns is important, but execution is equally important.

This is the confusing part for many people. They do not know how to accept a loss, but they still believe the fact that making money in the market is possible.

There is never any money to be made in the obvious conclusions.

Some of the skills to be learned include building a watchlist, finding the Stocks in Play (finding the correct stocks to trade), identifying and practicing strategies, finding patterns, and learning about positions.

Many famous traders say trading is 80% psychology and 20% technical knowledge.

As Dr. Alexander Elder writes in his book, Trading for a Living, successful traders watch their trades and their money as carefully as professional scuba divers watch their.

You have to be significantly above the crowd to win in day trading. Trading is a minus-sum game. Just by entering into the market, you start losing. Your bank charges you a fee for wiring out to fund your trading account. Your broker will charge you an incoming wiring fee for funding the account and then start charging you for their market data, the use of their platform and a commission on each trade that you make. If you do not make enough monthly commissions for them, they will then charge you an inactivity fee.

Day trading is not a hobby. It’s not a weekend pursuit.

Personally believe you must start developing the discipline of a winner. You need to get up early, get dressed, and be seated in front of your trading station, just as if you were getting ready to go to any other job. You can’t be casual about it. You can be successful, but in order to succeed, you have to be better prepared than many of the other traders that you are competing against. A significant part of achieving that success is to learn how to control your emotions. You have to be “calm, cool and collected” as the saying goes. You have to somehow find a way to control your emotions.

Day trading is not a hobby. It’s not a weekend pursuit. Once you begin trading with your real money, you need to treat it as your job, as your career, and as your profession.

While risk-taking in trading needs to be carefully and rationally managed, an excessive avoidance of risk can be a major roadblock to success.

Greed is probably a more common occupational hazard in trading, especially among novice traders.

My trading career has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a subject none of us will ever understand fully. Resilience is one of the greatest psychoanalytic puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the religious instinct. To get the exact answer, we have to look more deeply into the human psyche.

Why do some people experience real hardships but do not lose their strength?.

People react very differently to challenges in life. In 1983, a talented young guitarist, Dave Mustaine, was kicked out of his newly formed band in the worst possible way. The band had just been signed to a record deal to record their first album. But a couple of days before the recording was to begin, without any warning, discussion, or a dramatic blowout, the band asked Dave to leave. He had to go back to his hometown the same day. He sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York and kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now? By the time the bus hit L.A., Dave had gotten over this bad experience and self-pity and vowed to start a new band. He decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision. He worked hard, he spent months recruiting the best musicians he could find, he wrote dozens of songs, and he practiced religiously. The combination of anger and ambition eventually led him to form the legendary heavy metal band Megadeth which sold 38 million plus albums and toured the world many times over. Today, Dave Mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavy metal music. The band Dave was fired from was Metallica, one of the best-selling bands ever. Although he never reached the same success as Metallica, he did put his life back on track. This is resilience at work.

Resilience is something you realize you have after the fact.

I recently watched a movie on Netflix, The Founder, about the life of the legendary Roy Kroc, the middle-aged and below average milkshake salesperson who began to build the McDonald’s empire at the age of.

“Now, I know what you're thinkin'. How the heck does a 52-year-old, over-the-hill milkshake machine salesman... build a fast food empire with 16,000 restaurants, in 50 states, in 5 foreign countries... with an annual revenue of in the neighborhood of $700,000,000.00... “One word... PERSISTENCE. “Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.”.

The first window is the Top List, which has six columns, with the first three columns for Nasdaq highest volume, highest gainers and highest losers.

Price action in the form of white/red candlesticks Volume of shares being traded and average volume line 9 Exponential Moving Average of price (9 EMA) and 20 Exponential Moving Average of price (20 EMA) 50 Simple Moving Average of price (50 SMA) and 200 Simple Moving Average of price (200 SMA) Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Previous day’s closing price Last sale price.

VWAP lets you know if the buyers or the sellers are in control of the price action.

Level 2 is known to be a “leading indicator”, which means it shows activity before a trade happens. Moving averages, charts and most of the other indicators are known as “lagging indicators”, meaning they provide information after the trades take place.

Trading a stock that doesn’t move is a trading day wasted.

A Stock in Play is a stock that offers excellent risk/reward setup opportunities - opportunities where your downside is 5 cents and your upside is 25 cents, or your downside is 20 cents and your upside is one dollar. That’s 1:5.

A Stock in Play that is about to trade higher or lower from its present price. Stocks in Play move, and their moves are predictable and frequent and catchable. A good intraday stock offers numerous and excellent risk/reward opportunities. Every day, there are new stocks that are in play. Trading Stocks in Play allow you to be the most efficient with your buying power. They often offer much better risk/reward opportunities intraday and allow you to execute your ideas and trading rules with more consistency. Trading the right Stocks in Play can help you to combat algorithmic programs. What are Stocks in Play? They could be, in no particular order: A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off.

A stock with fresh news A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market Open A stock that has an unusual pre-market trading activity A stock that develops important intraday levels from which you can trade off You need to keep in mind that retail trading does not work on all stocks. It only works on the stocks that have high relative volume. Some stocks like Apple Inc. (ticker: AAPL) will on average trade millions and millions of shares each day, while other stocks on average might trade only 500,000 shares each day. Does this mean you should trade AAPL only? No. High volume will be relative from one stock to another. You don’t look just for high total volume. There are some stocks that regularly trade with high volume. What.

If trading volume is not higher than normal, it means that the trading is being dominated by institutional traders and high frequency trading computers. Stay away from it.

The most important characteristic of high relative volume stocks is that these stocks trade independent of what their sector and the overall market are doing. When the market is weak, it means that the majority of stocks are selling off. It does not matter if it is Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Exxon Mobil. When the market is strong, the prices of the majority of stocks will be going higher.

The behavior of stocks that have high relative volume independent of the overall market are referred to as Stocks in Play. Every day, only a handful of stocks are being traded independently of their sector and the overall market.

Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play - high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.

Based on my experience, trading and losing on low float stocks is the number one reason new traders blow up their accounts.

Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 2% Stocks that have traded at least 100,000 shares by 9 a.m. in the pre-market Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares Stocks that have Average True Range (ATR) of at least 50 cents (how much of a range a stock has on average every day) There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.

High volume with no volatility in the pre-market is often a sign of “buyout” news. This means ALR has been acquired at an agreed price and although it has gapped up, there will be no trading opportunity during the day.

Buyout gaps are very common in the market, but remember, they are not tradeable. When a company acquires another company, the price is determined and usually there will be no volatility in the price for you to trade on.

This large transaction is called a “block trade”. A block trade, also known as a block order, is an order or trade submitted for the sale or purchase of a large quantity of shares being traded at an arranged price between two parties, sometimes outside of the open markets, to lessen the impact on the price of the stock.

I am often asked by new traders how to make a Gappers watchlist if they do not have a Trade Ideas scanner. In that case, you can make use of one of the free scanners available on the Internet such as www.finviz.com. The DAS platform also has a basic scanner built into it for free use by its subscribers, but it does not allow you to filter and define more sophisticated scanners by changing parameters such as ATR or float. If you have the DAS platform, many of the Gappers watchlist stocks will often also hit the Top List window. For example, Figure 3.13 shows my Gappers watchlist on October 25, 2017 next to my Top List window for that day. As you can see, many Gappers watchlist candidates are actually on the Top List as well, as I marked.

Review the price action of the candidates on both 5-minute and daily charts and look for decent pre-market activity.

A good pre-market activity is relative, but a uniform volume on the pre-market and clean price action on the 5-minute chart is important. Having gradual moves to the upside or downside, establishing clear pre-market levels, and respecting VWAP and moving averages are sufficiently clean price action for me.

This is how I find in real time the low float stocks that are making new highs of the day that meet the following filter criteria: Price range: $1 to $10 The volume today is at least 200,000 shares The float is a maximum of 10,000,000 shares The volume in the last 5 minutes is between 400% and 2,000% of normal The current volume is at least 2 times the normal average volume The 15-minute range is at least $0.30.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI.

Daily RSI is often used by swing traders to identify overbought or oversold price ranges, while 5-minute or 15-minute RSI ranges are sometimes used by day traders to find potential reversal opportunities. RSI values range from 0 to 100. Traditionally, RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a stock is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore may be prime for a reversal or pull back. On the other hand, an RSI reading of 30 or below can indicate an oversold or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal.

I set my RSI Extreme Scanner in a way that only shows stocks which are entering an extreme range of either above 90 or below 10 within a 5–minute time frame.

I have found that almost all of the stocks which hit my RSI Extreme Scanner during the day are Stocks in Play. I may not necessarily trade them all, but they often do provide good trading opportunities.

If you overtrade, your broker will become richer, and you will become, well, broker! Remember, your goal is to trade well, not to trade often.

Profitable traders usually make only two or three trades each day. They then cash out and enjoy the rest of their day.

Support and resistance levels are very important reference points because so many traders recognize them and believe in their significance. It’s herd mentality 101.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days.

Similar to PCL, yesterday’s and the day before yesterday’s low and high are often important intraday levels for the next trading days. I use a tool called PriceMarker, which is referred to as a Study in my DAS platform, to automatically put four levels on my chart for any stock that I am watching.

Previous day close plus yesterday’s high, yesterday’s low, two days ago high and two days ago low. These are very, very important to support and resistance.

Stocks in Play often have clean pre-market activity, and that is one of my important criteria for shortlisting the Gappers for my final watchlist.

Two powerful levels for day traders are the high and the low of the pre-market activity.

Moving averages on higher time frames such as daily charts and 5-minute charts are important support and resistance levels, especially the larger moving averages such as 50 SMA and 200 SMA.

Please note that as a rule of thumb, the higher the time frame and the higher the moving averages are, the stronger the support and resistance levels will be. A 200 SMA on a daily chart is perhaps the strongest support and resistance level. Moving averages on 1-minute charts on the other hand tend to be less strong.

Daily chart >> 5-minute chart >> 1-minute chart 200 SMA >> 50 SMA >> 20 EMA >> 9 EMA.

A large wick to the upside or downside on a daily chart will immediately catch my attention.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value.

I usually try to identify that level with a line that touches the maximum number of reversals or wicks. The more of a line that is touching extreme price lines, the more that the line is a better support and resistance and has more value. Sometimes it is not clear which line is the optimum line, and in those situations all you can do is just draw the best that you can.

For day trading, it is better to draw support and resistance lines across the extreme prices or wicks on daily levels rather than across areas where the bulk of the bars stopped. This is the complete opposite of swing trading. For swing trading, you need to draw support and resistance lines across the edges of congested areas where the bulk of the bars stopped rather than across the extreme prices. Swing traders often ignore those wicks on daily charts. This is because the close price is more important for swing trading than the extreme wicks in daily bars are. The close price of a stock on a daily chart is the price that the market makers and professional traders have agreed on.

Support and resistance lines on daily charts are not always easy to find, and at times you will not be able to draw anything clear. If I cannot see anything clear, I don’t have to draw anything. There is a good chance that other traders will also not see those lines clearly and therefore there is no point in forcing myself to draw support and resistance lines. In that case, I will plan my trades based on the VWAP or moving averages or other levels that I earlier discussed.
