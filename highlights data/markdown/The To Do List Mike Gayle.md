The answer, to me at least, is simple: love. I’m doing it all for love. Because no matter how you say it and how often it gets said, actions will always speak louder than words and right now, though some might call it pointless, frivolous, or just plain stupid, flying to the other side of the Atlantic for the sake of a $12 coffee mug is the one thing I want to say in the loudest possible way.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh.

She paused to laugh her beautiful laugh. ‘Did I leave anything out?’.

Would a ‘proper adult’ have underwear in active service that was well over a decade old?.

After sweeping a pile of discarded newspapers and sweet wrappers onto the floor, I settled myself at my desk and in large capital letters wrote the words that would change my life: ‘TO-DO LIST.’.

To me a list is a statement of intent, a plan, a map to point you in the right direction. Without my To-Do Lists I’d be lost. Without my To-Do Lists I would just be making stuff up as I went along and that, as far as I’m concerned, is no way to live a life.

My early To-Do Lists tended to be lists of books that I wanted to read, and each time I read one I got a tick. Now, while the writing of a list can be a reward in itself, as any veteran To-Do Lister will attest, the real pay-off is the satisfaction that comes from ticking, crossing, or scribbling an item off your list. With one neat action a task that has been bugging you for the longest time is utterly obliterated. Pow! It’s gone. Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.

Nothing beats a hard-won tick off the list.        Soon after reaching secondary school in the early eighties, I came to realise that the making of To-Do Lists wasn’t just an idle pastime but rather a means of survival, the significance of which I learned the hard way.

‘Unless you’re dead there’s always going to be stuff that needs doing.’.

Canadians appear to be not only incredibly sensible but also really nice. Trust me, every home should have one.

I share this story in order to illustrate an important fact about myself: when it comes to an undertaking, I am the very definition of: ‘Act first. Think later’. And the To-Do List was no exception.

My first step was to head for the shops in the hope that purchasing useful things would miraculously change my life.

Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask,.

‘Organise book shelves so that you can find a specific book without looking through everything’).

‘Since we’re talking lists, I will tell you something that I don’t tell many people because they’d laugh at me: I make To-Do Lists all the time and sometimes when I’m feeling particularly low I put things like “Take a shower” just to have the satisfaction of ticking it off. It’s my kick-start for the day.’.

In fact I would break them up into the things that you’re excited about and the things that you’re not so excited about and then alternate them so there’s always something to look forward to. It’s like eating your pudding before your tea. If you do, there’s no incentive to eat your tea.’.

I encourage people to put on their list to “think” about things and “explore” so that the list is creative in itself.’.

‘That’s easy. The best thing is to tell every single person you know what you’re doing so that you commit yourself fully to the project.’.

7. To make sure Gayle doesn’t give up halfway, there will be an audit at the end of April just to make sure that he’s on track.

‘How can I go back to sleep when you’ve just told me there’s nothing to worry about?’ She too sat bolt upright. ‘What is it exactly that I shouldn’t be worrying about?’        ‘The To-Do List,’ I replied.

‘Good, we’re on the same page then. Now, listen, Mike, I love you, you know I do, but right now I really, really, really have to go to sleep. So if you wake me up again with any more revelations I can’t be held responsible for my actions, okay?’        ‘Yeah,’ I replied. ‘Okay.’.

‘All I know is this: you might have given up the List but the List doesn’t seem to have given up on you.’.

We hadn’t always been the people we were now.

Some things he ticked off the list and some things he didn’t.

‘La, la, la, I’m not listening! La, la, la! You think I’m listening but I’m not!’.

As those months became two years I began to wonder whether I was suffering from some kind of mental illness which led me to confuse the act of cancelling my direct debit with dumping a particularly tear prone girlfriend.

Step 1) present the person/multinational you wish to leave with an insurmountable problem that explains why you want to call it off. Step 2) cross your fingers and hope that they can’t come up with a solution.

‘Because I don’t want to be calm! I’ve just had the phone put down on me! Have you any idea how outrageous that is? What kind of world do we live in where people can put phones down on other people just because they’re recording phone calls? This isn’t Communist-era eastern Germany you know? I’ve got rights! This is England!’.

“Catch up with lost friends because you know what? They used to be great friends”.’.

‘Because when you’re a man, ignorance isn’t just bliss. It’s also the stuff that keeps the walls from falling down.’.

‘Start losing weight before you end up in a Channel Five documentary about fat people so huge that they have to be winched out of bed by helicopter’.

‘Okay, then it has to be receiving murderous phone calls on stormy nights only to call the operator and be told that they’re coming from inside the house!’.

Claire referring to our children as my children was a bad sign. I was in big trouble.

Love you, you know,’ I whispered in her ear. ‘A lot of women would make a big deal about their husbands clearing off around the world at the drop of a hat so it’s really cool that you’re being so understanding.’.

‘We’ll deal with it when we deal with it but I’m making no promises that it will be okay.’.

I couldn’t believe it. It had only been a couple of months since I’d made her a grandmother for the second time and she was already holding out for more? Was no number of grandchildren enough to sate this woman?.

‘So you were hoping Claire and I would have another baby just so that they didn’t go to waste?’.

This is the twenty-first century, babe. Real men moisturise.’.

‘Be nicer to wife because it’ll only be a matter of time before she compares notes with her mates and finally works out what kind of a rough deal she’s on’,.

‘It feels a bit girlie. I told Claire that real men moisturise but I’m pretty sure they don’t. Other than shower gel, deodorant, aftershave and a bit of toothpaste, real men don’t do toiletries.’.

Peace.        War and Peace (Item 1021) had been on my mental To-Do List for some years now. Having first been introduced to the novel by my secondary school English teacher, Mrs Parker, who hailed it as a ‘must read classic’, at the age of thirteen I had searched it out from my local library and had been stunned to discover that it was roughly the same size and density as a house brick.

I’d think to myself, one day I really must get around to reading that and while novels that I had previously put into that category, like Slaughter House Five and On The Road, got read, when it came to War and Peace I always seemed to find something more pressing to do. This time was going to be different. This time I was going to give Tolstoy my very best shot.

I don’t know how but I can tell that even from behind her sunglasses Claire is rolling her eyes.

‘I think that it’s probably an okay book if you’re into Russian literature but most people read War and Peace because it’s a big fat book that gets name dropped a lot as a shorthand signifier of supposed intellectual greatness.

George Leigh Mallory wanted to climb Mount Everest: ‘Because it’s there.’.

It was like that maxim of Karl Marx that a man should be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner without permanently becoming hunter, fisherman, cowherd or critic.

I needed to do something special for her.

I needed to do something special for her. Something to demonstrate that I really did think she was the best woman in the world. Three days later I hit the jackpot.

This is trying my patience to the extent that I am verbally abusing both the computer and the printer with the threat of violence.

I am wishing that someone would invent a machine that would just do the things that you want it to do without you having to get involved with any of it. 2.05 p.m. I’ve just repeated my invention wish to Claire. She tells me I’ve already got one: ‘It’s called a wife and it’s how ninety per cent of the things that need doing in our house actually get done.’.

10. As hard as it is, being a dad is the best job in the world.

‘Try to make friends with new and interesting people so that you don’t spend your whole life talking about films, music and last week’s episode of Dr Who.’ Just.

‘Try to make friends with new and interesting people so that you don’t spend your whole life talking about films, music and last week’s episode of Dr Who.’.

It was more than that. It was hopes and dreams and me getting a life and being a proper grown-up.’.

The List wasn’t just a bunch of words on a piece of paper. It was more than that. It was hopes and dreams and me getting a life and being a proper grown-up.’.

‘Freud would say that there are no accidents and that it was probably your sub-conscious mind’s way of saying you’re getting sick of all this To-Do-List stuff.’.

‘Freud would say that there are no accidents and that it was probably your sub-conscious mind’s way of saying you’re getting sick of all this To-Do-List stuff.’        ‘Well, it’s a good job that Freud isn’t here otherwise I’d have to tell him he was quite wrong and the last thing I’d want to do is offend the father of modern psychoanalysis by telling him he was talking cobblers.’.

‘So why are you crying then?’        ‘I’m not,’ she said, wiping her eyes. ‘You must be seeing things.’.

‘I feel stupid because it happened ages ago and I should have said something at the time but I didn’t want to seem petty, but the fact is you hurt my feelings and I think you ought to know why.’.

‘Because even if I’m not the most efficient person in the world – which I admit I’m not – it would be nice if there were one person in the world who thinks I’m great at everything.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’.

‘But you are great at everything,’ I said giving her a big squeeze. ‘I was there both times you gave birth so I’ve got first-hand evidence that you are indeed Wonder Woman. But don’t worry, your secret identity is safe with me.’ I paused and added a timely, ‘I love you, you know.’.

‘Do you know what, Simon?’ I began, ‘I think I really am. I had a problem with it before because I thought it would end up just being about a bloke ticking things off a list. I can see now that it will actually be about lots of other stuff too like family and friendship, overcoming obstacles, growing up, taking risks and learning about the things you’re really capable of.’.
