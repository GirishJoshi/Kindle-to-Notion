Which is why I am writing this book. To think. To understand. It just happens to be the way I'm made. I have to write things down to feel I fully comprehend them.

"I know these things. I'm always right. It's got nothing to do with logic: I just feel it. For example, when I'm really close to you like this, I'm not the least bit scared. Nothing dark or evil could ever tempt me.".

What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?.

Once, long ago, when I was still young, when the memories were far more vivid than they are now, I often tried to write about her. But I couldn't produce a line. I knew that if that first line would come, the rest would pour itself onto the page, but I could never make it happen.

Everything was too sharp and clear, so that I could never tell where to start - the way a map that shows too much can sometimes be useless.

I didn't know why the flag had to be taken down at night. The nation continued to exist while it was dark, and plenty of people worked all night - railway construction crews and taxi drivers and bar hostesses and firemen and night watchmen: it seemed unfair to me that such people were denied the protection of the flag. Or maybe it didn't matter all that much and nobody really cared - aside from me. Not that I really cared, either. It was just something that happened to cross my mind.

I was impressed by the variety of dreams and goals that life could offer.

This was one of the very first new impressions I received when I came to Tokyo for the first time. The thought struck me that society needed a few people - just a few - who were interested in and even passionate about mapmaking.

And a lot prettier than I remembered. I wanted to tell her that, but couldn't find a good way to put it.

We had never really had much to say to each other.

Until that time, I had understood death as something entirely separate from and independent of life. The hand of death is bound to take us, I had felt, but until the day it reaches out for us, it leaves us alone. This had seemed to me the simple, logical truth. Life is here, death is over there. I am here, not over there.

Death was not the opposite of life. It was already here, within my being, it had always been here, and no struggle would permit me to forget that.

We could face each other over coffee cups in total silence.

He was a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least 30 years.

He was a far more voracious reader than me, but he made it a rule never to touch a book by any author who had not been dead at least 30 years. "That's the only kind of book I can trust," he said. "It's not that I don't believe in contemporary literature," he added, "but I don't want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had the baptism of time.

"That's why I read them. If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking. That's the world of hicks and slobs. Real people would be ashamed of themselves doing that.

I saw Nagasawa drunk and tormenting.

"That proves you're a decent human being," he said. "Congratulations.

When you're surrounded by endless possibilities, one of the hardest things you can do is pass them up. See what I mean?".

Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around, but she never complained to him.

Hatsumi had a pretty good idea that Nagasawa was sleeping around, but she never complained to him. She was seriously in love, but she never made demands.

"Nobody likes being alone. I just hate to be disappointed.'.

"Tell me, Nagasawa," I asked, "what is the "standard of action' in your life?" "You'll laugh if I tell you," he said. "No I won't." "All right," he said. "To be a gentleman." I didn't laugh, but I nearly fell off my chair. "To be a gentleman? A gentleman?" "You heard me." "What does it mean to be a gentleman? How do you define it?".

"A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do but what he should do.".

"You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

"It's because you show it," she said. "You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

"Maybe so," I said. "Maybe that's why people don't like me. Never have." "It's because you show it," she said. "You make it obvious you don't care whether people like you or not. That makes some people angry.".

But if they - my father and mother - had loved me a little more, I would have been able to feel more - to feel real sadness, for example.".

Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more.

Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it - to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just once. But they never gave that to me. Never, not once. If I tried to cuddle up and beg for something, they'd just shove me away and yell at me. "No! That costs too much!' It's all I ever heard. So I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me uncon- ditionally 365 days a year. I was still in primary school at the time, but I made up my mind once and for all.".

"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone, I feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until there's nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the earth.

In doing so, however,.

Can't do what you can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass.

As long as we are here, we can get by without hurting others or being hurt by them because we know that we are "deformed". That's what distinguishes us from the outside world: most people go about their lives unconscious of their deformities, while in this little world of ours the deformities themselves are a precondition.

"What should I do, then? Give me an example.".

"I hate waiting at home all day for a call. When I spend the day alone, I feel as if my flesh is rotting little by little - rotting and melting until there's nothing left but a green puddle that gets sucked down into the earth. And all that stays behind are my clothes. That's how it feels to me, waiting indoors all day.".

At first she tried to get me to sing bass harmony, but I was so bad she gave up and sang alone to her heart's content.

Say this not as an excuse or a means of self- justification but because it is true. If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound but mine as well. So please try not to hate me. I am a flawed human being - a far more flawed human being than you realize. Which is precisely why I do not want you to hate me. Because if you were to do that, I would really go to pieces. I can't do what you can do: I can't slip inside my shell and wait for things to pass.

Just as each person has certain idiosyncrasies in the way he or she walks, people have idiosyncrasies in the way they think and feel and see things, and though you might want to correct them, it doesn't happen overnight, and if you try to force the issue in one case, something else might go funny.

It may well be that we can never fully adapt to our own deformities.

The one thing I don't want to be is a burden to anyone.

I told Naoko about Storm Trooper's sudden disappearance and about the last day I saw him, when he gave me the firefly.

"What do we talk about? Just ordinary things. What happened that day, or books we've read, or tomorrow's weather, you know. Don't tell me you're wondering if people jump to their feet and shout stuff like: "It'll rain tomorrow if a polar bear eats the stars tonight!"'.

You don't have to convince anybody of anything, and you don't have to attract anyone's attention.".

"But don't ever tell another woman that you find her wrinkles attractive," she added. "I like to hear it, but I'm the exception.".

"Such perfect little circles are impossible to maintain.

I couldn't tell the difference between his strong points and his flaws, they were all the same to me.

"If you stay here long enough, you can pretty much tell the weather by the smell of the air," said Reiko.

Have a lot more patience for others than I have for myself, and I'm much better at bringing out the best in others than in myself. That's just the kind of person I am. I'm the scratchy stuff on the side of the matchbox. But that's fine with me. I don't mind at all. Better to be a first-class matchbox than a second-class match.

People are always trying to force stuff on me. The minute they see me they start telling me what to do. At least you don't try to force stuff on me." "I don't know you well enough to force stuff on you." "You mean, if you knew me better, you'd force stuff on me like everyone else?" "It's possible," I said. "That's how people live in the real world: forcing stuff on each other.".

"I suppose so. I kind of doubt that anyone thinks about the stock market or verb conjugations or the Suez Canal when they wank. Nope, I'm pretty sure just about everybody thinks about girls.".

"You know, Watanabe, you're really good at explaining things to people.".

I'm way too busy as it is.".

Reiko says it's good I can cry. But feeling lonely really hurts.

I spent the next few days buying the things I needed in the nearby Kichijoji shopping district and started cooking simple meals for myself at home.

No truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one.

This: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow.

This: no truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness, can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see that sadness through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning.

By "those guys" Reiko of course meant John Lennon, Paul Mc Cartney and George Harrison. After a short breather, Reiko crushed her cigarette out and picked up her guitar again. She played "Penny Lane", "Blackbird", "Julia", "When I'm 64", "Nowhere Man", "And I Love Her", and "Hey Jude".

"Letters are just pieces of paper," I said. "Burn them, and what stays in your heart will stay; keep them, and what vanishes will vanish.".

"I have a million things to talk to you about. A million things we have to talk about. All I want in this world is you. I want to see you and talk. I want the two of us to begin everything from the beginning.".
