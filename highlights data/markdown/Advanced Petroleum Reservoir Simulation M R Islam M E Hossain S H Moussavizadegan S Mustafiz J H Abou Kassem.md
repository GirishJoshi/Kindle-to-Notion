The petroleum industry is known as the biggest user of computer models. Even though space research and weather prediction models are robust and often tagged as the “mother of all simulation”, the fact that a space probe device or a weather balloon can be launched – while a vehicle capable of moving around in a petroleum reservoir cannot – makes reservoir modeling more challenging than in any other discipline.

First, there is a lack of data and their proper scaling up.

Second is the problem of assuring correct solutions to the mathematical models that represent the reservoir data.

Data acquisition and remote-sensing ability. However, in the absence of proper science, it is anecdotally said that a weather model of Alaska can be used to simulate a petroleum reservoir in Texas. Of course, pragmatism.

This has the embedded assumption that ‘outcome justifies the process’ – the ultimate of the obsession with externals.

That proper reservoir simulation should be transparent and empower decision makers rather than creating a black box.

This principle implies that the input data have to be accurate for the simulation results to be acceptable.

Petroleum industry has established itself as the pioneer of subsurface data collection.

For a modeling process to be knowledge-based, it must fulfill two criteria, namely, the source has to be true (or real) and the subsequent processing has to be true.
