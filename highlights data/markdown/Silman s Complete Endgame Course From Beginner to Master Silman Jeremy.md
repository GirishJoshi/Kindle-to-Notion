“Amazingly enough, I have not yet found a single endgame manual which I could recommend wholeheartedly to my pupils. Most existing books are either elementary and useful for novices only, or are useless methodologically, or do not cover endgame theory fully.”.

Jumping from book to book is a fast track to nowhere.

After mastering the material there, put the book away and spend your time studying tactics and a few strategic concepts.

For example, I heretically decided not to include Bishop and Knight vs. Lone King because it’s far from easy to master, and it occurs very rarely in over-the-board play.

Think about it: an hour of work for a lifetime of endgame confidence.

“nobody ever won a game by resigning.”.

Beginners only need to be aware of two endgame situations: Overkill Mates (one side has an enormous amount of material versus the lone enemy King) and Stalemates (one side has no legal moves, but is not in check).

When you are up by a Queen and a Rook, or even by two Queens (or more!), one must wonder if your opponent (who could give up and show a bit of respect) is bullheaded or simply enjoys suffering and/or pain. Whatever his reasons for continuing might be, you are the one who must now demonstrate how easy it is to score the victory.

Trust me, nobody cares if you mate in three or five, as long as you succeed every time!).

As in almost all mating endgames, you need to push the enemy King to one of the four sides of the board. The point of the Staircase is to use one major piece (Rook or Queen) to keep the enemy King from stepping onto a rank or file. Then the other major piece will give check along the next rank or file, forcing the target King to step closer to its doom on the side of the board.

However, if you’ve become addicted to endgame study and wish to continue your “technical” education, the following books should prove both useful and enjoyable.

This didn’t seem to affect me too much because I lost the vast majority of my games rather quickly and rarely had need of any endgame skills at all.

Here in Part Two, you’ll learn what material advantages do and don’t win, and you’ll take your first step into the world of serious endgame knowledge—you’ll develop an appreciation for the powers of the King, the mysteries of the Opposition, and the drawing proclivities of the rook-pawns.

Two Bishops = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight = CAN!.

Bishop and Knight (5) might never occur in your whole chess lifetime and is far too difficult to waste your precious study time on (in other words, this book won’t examine Bishop and Knight vs. King at all).

White only has a chance to deliver mate in this endgame if black’s King blunders into a mate in one.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame.

Sadly, wisdom in one situation isn’t always wisdom in another, and what passes for correct opening and middlegame strategy can often be wrong in the endgame. The truth is, the King is a very strong piece (at least as strong as a Bishop or Knight)! Unfortunately, the terror created by the game’s early phases causes most players to lose sight of this piece’s true worth.

In such a situation it is a disadvantage to have the move since you must give up control of one of the blockade squares (shown by the three Xs in the diagram) and thus allow the opponent a way into your position.

When your King has to step away from the pawn, always go straight back!.

Yet, the game is a dead draw if Black stops the white King from penetrating to the front of its pawn.

King and rook-pawn vs. lone King: If the defender’s King gets in front of the pawn, the game will always be a draw!.

Whoever moves with an odd number of squares between the Kings does not have the Opposition (it’s the same in basic Opposition situations: one/odd square separates the Kings and the person to move doesn’t have the Opposition). Conversely, the person to move with an even number of squares between the Kings does have the Opposition.

In such Opposition battles, you want to have an odd number of squares between the Kings with the other guy to move!.

In this type of situation, the rule is to make a square or a rectangle in which each corner is the same color with the other guy to move.

It can be seen that it is not difficult to determine who has the Opposition when the Kings “connect” on a rank, file, or diagonal. But what if they fail to connect altogether?.

Unless the defending King is on vacation elsewhere on the board, the presence of a rook-pawn will make the game a draw.

If you’re trying to win and you can enter a pawn up endgame where you have a rook-pawn, be careful! The words “rook-pawn” and “draw” seem to be bound at the hip!.

Of course, 4...Kf8?? 5.h7, 1-0, would leave us wondering about the state of black’s mental health.

If the defender has it, then the game is a draw. If the stronger side has the Opposition, then the game is won.

When the stronger side gets his King (on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th rank) directly in front of his pawn, the only question that matters is, “Who owns the Opposition?”.

Move as far forward with your King as possible, while always making sure that your pawn is safe!.

Fox in the Chicken Coup refers to a situation where the stronger side’s King (the “fox”) rushes to the other side of the board to feast on helpless enemy pawns (“chickens”) while the defending King is busy dealing with a pawn on the other wing.

“When your King is in front of your pawn, go as far forward as possible until the pawn is in danger.”.

As you can see, a player must always be on the alert for such “freezing” moves!.

In such situations, players sometimes refer to pawns of this nature as “baby Queens” since they have one purpose in life: to reach the end of the board and become an adult!.

If the Knight can take control of any square in front of the pawn, the game is drawn.

A lone Knight can only triumph over a lone pawn if that pawn is a rook-pawn and if its King is trapped in front of it. Why? Because, in certain rare instances, the rook-pawn allows smother mates to occur.

If the enemy pawn is well into its journey towards promotion, and if its King is helping, and if the Rook’s King is off on vacation, then a draw will result.

A pawn on the 5th rank and a King trapped on the 3rd rank by the enemy Rook is always a win for the side with the Rook.

As in all endgames, stalemates play an important part in the defender’s hopes and must always remain in the stronger side’s mind as something to avoid at all costs.

If this doesn’t make any sense, run, don’t walk, to Part Three and read the section on Indirect Opposition again.

If taking the Opposition fails to accomplish the goal of getting the King in front of its pawn, then it’s useless to take the Opposition in the first place.

This rule—if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition, illustrated in Part Three, Diagram 62—only flounders if the pawn is a rook-pawn, or if the pawn is on the 5th rank and its King is on the 6th.

Our oft-repeated rule (i.e., if the stronger side’s King gets one square in front of its pawn the result of the game depends on who has the Opposition), shockingly, turns out to have two exceptions!.

By now you should know when a basic King and pawn vs. lone King position is lost or drawn.

This kind of position, which can occur with any set of pawns other than rook-pawns (with both Kings in front of their respective pawns), is known as a Trébuchet.

There is not much to learn, since a glance will make things pretty clear: whoever moves is in zugzwang—he is forced to move away from the defense of his pawn, which will result in an obviously lost King and pawn vs. lone King situation. Thus, if White has the move:.

The idea of something definable which can help us understand the right path in seemingly tough positions is an important one, and we’ll be searching for such “crutches” all through this book.

Since black’s King will be closer to the two center pawns (meaning that he can make first contact), White will end up a loser in the coming battle.

In a near (upcoming) Trébuchet position, the side whose King can make first diagonal contact with the enemy pawn can force a winning Trébuchet.

You can often solve seemingly difficult situations by steering the game towards the many basic situations you have mastered.

The ability to see whether or not you or your opponent can gain the Opposition in key moments is extremely important. Successful endgame play is impossible without this skill.

He’s not able to use the “move the King straight back” rule since he’s run out of board!.

In diagram 99, Black’s King was not able to step backwards after the pawn reached e6 and, as a result, he lost.

There is a bit of an optical illusion in diagram 99, so carefully compare the last two positions until the “why” and “how” becomes clear.

If the pawns are healthy and not rook-pawns, King and two pawns vs. a lone King always wins.

King and two (doubled) pawns vs. lone King always win unless the pawns can’t be properly defended, or unless they are rook-pawns.

“Excuse me, but could you kindly move your King away from the front of my pawn?”.

When you possess King and two doubled pawns vs. lone King, don’t push both pawns up the board together since that increases the weaker side’s chances for a lucky stalemate.

If the defender’s King stands on any of the “X” squares the game will be a draw (the position of white’s King won’t change the result).

Can black’s King stop (or even win) the enemy pawn? The game hangs in the balance—if the black King can stop the pawn, then the game is drawn, while the game is lost if the King can’t. The answer lies in a technique called the Square of the Pawn.

After a bit of time the whole Square of the Pawn idea will be an easy and natural part of your chess arsenal.

What is an Outside Passed Pawn? It’s a passed pawn that stands to the side of the main sphere of battle. Such a pawn is usually a very valuable commodity since it can be far from the enemy King and thus pose a serious promotion threat, and/or it can force the defending King over to deal with it, leaving the embattled area (where most of the pawns reside) bereft of a defender.

A Bishop and (safe) non rook-pawn vs. lone King is always a win (finally something makes sense!).
