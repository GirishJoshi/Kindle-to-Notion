Traps An accumulation of hydrocarbon in a formation that occurs when the upward migration of hydrocarbon through a permeable rock is halted by a relatively impermeable cap rock.

Unconformity A surface between successive geologic strata representing a gap in the geologic record.

A reservoir is that portion of the trapped formation that contains oil and/or gas as a single hydraulically connected system.

Reservoir A subsurface geologic structure with sufficient porosity to store hydrocarbons.

Liquid produced at the surface from a fluid that is gas in the reservoir is called gas condensate because the liquid condenses from the gas phase.

An older name for gas condensate is gas distillate.

Volume of reservoir gas will produce both natural gas and condensate at the surface, and both gas and condensate volumes must be estimated.

A volume of reservoir oil will produce both oil and the associated dissolved gas at the surface, and both dissolved natural gas and crude oil volumes must be estimated.

The recoverable natural gas liquid (condensate) from the gas cap. Although the hydrocarbons in place are fixed quantities, which are referred to as the resource, the reserves depend on the mechanisms by which the reservoir is produced.

The free gas or associated gas, the dissolved gas, the oil in the oil zone, and the recoverable natural gas liquid (condensate) from the gas cap.

Reserves Volume of hydrocarbon that can be economically recovered from a reservoir using current technology.

Petroleum Resources Management System.

Reservoir engineering may be defined as the application of scientific principles to the drainage problems arising during the development and production of oil and gas reservoirs.

“the art of developing and producing oil and gas fluids in such a manner as to obtain a high economic recovery.”.

Subsurface geology, applied mathematics, and the basic laws of physics and chemistry governing the behavior of liquid and vapor phases of crude oil, natural gas, and water in reservoir rocks.

To account for all the reservoir fluid as pressure changes, a volume factor (B) is used. The volume factor is a ratio of the volume of the fluid at reservoir conditions to its volume at atmospheric conditions.

An M (1000) or MM (1 million) or MMM (1 billion) is.

An M (1000) or MM (1 million) or MMM (1 billion) is frequently placed before the units SCF.

The reservoir fluid typically sees only a decrease in pressure, while the produced fluid will experience decreases in pressure and in temperature.

As the fluid is produced from the reservoir, the pressure on the rock from the overburden or the rock above it remains constant but the pressure of the fluid surrounding it is decreasing. This leads the rock to expand or the pores in the rock to be compressed.

The compressibility factor is simply a ratio of how the gas would behave ideally compared to how it behaves in actuality.

The overall recovery efficiency E of any fluid displacement process is given by the product of the macroscopic, or volumetric displacement, efficiency, Ev, and the microscopic displacement efficiency, Ed.

The macroscopic displacement efficiency is a measure of how well the displacing fluid has contacted the oil-bearing parts of the reservoir.

The microscopic displacement efficiency is a measure of how well the displacing fluid mobilizes the residual oil once the fluid has contacted the oil.

The areal, Es, sweep efficiency and the vertical, Ei, sweep efficiency.

Interfacial and surface tension forces, wettability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability.

The forces per unit length acting at the fluid-fluid and rock-fluid interfaces are referred to as interfacial tensions.

The interfacial tension between two fluids represents the amount of work required to create a new unit of surface area at the interface.

The tendency for a solid to prefer one fluid over another is called wettability. Wettability is a function of the chemical composition of both the fluids and the rock. Surfaces can be either oil wet or water wet, depending on the chemical composition of the fluids.

Large, polar compounds in the oil phase can absorb onto the solid surface, leaving an oil film that may alter the wettability of the surface.

The pressure in the oil phase immediately above the oil-brine interface in the capillary tube will be slightly greater than the pressure in the water phase just below the interface. This difference in pressure is called the capillary pressure, Pc, of the system.

The greater pressure will always occur in the nonwetting phase.

Capillary pressures have also been found to be a function of the saturation history, although this dependence is not reflected in Eq. (10.2). For this reason, different values of capillary pressure are obtained during the drainage process (i.e., displacing the wetting phase by the nonwetting phase), then during the imbibitions process (i.e., displacing the nonwetting phase with the wetting phase). This hysteresis phenomenon is exhibited in all rock-fluid systems.

Pressure required to force a nonwetting phase through a small capillary can be very large.

Another factor affecting the microscopic displacement efficiency is the fact that when two or more fluid phases are present and flowing, the saturation of one phase affects the permeability of the other(s).

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it,.

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it, provided that the fluid saturates 100% of the pore space of the.

Except for gases at low pressures, the permeability of a rock is a property of the rock and not of the fluid that flows through it, provided that the fluid saturates 100% of the pore space of the rock.

The effective permeability, then, is the permeability of a rock to a particular fluid when that fluid has a pore saturation of less than 100%. As noted in the foregoing example, the sum of the effective permeabilities (i.e., 298 md) is always less than the absolute permeability, 413.

Permeabilities. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability to the absolute permeability.

The critical saturation, the saturation at which oil first begins to flow as the oil saturation increases.

The critical saturation, the saturation at which oil first begins to flow as the oil saturation increases. It is also called the residual saturation, the value below which the oil saturation cannot be reduced in an oil-water system.

Because of this, at 20% water saturation, the water occupies the least favorable portions of the pore spaces—that is, as thin layers about the sand grains, as thin layers on the walls of the pore cavities, and in the smaller crevices and capillaries.

The oil, which occupies 80% of the pore space, is in the most favorable portions of the pore spaces,.

Although it is true that the viscosities, the interfacial tensions, and other factors have some effect on the relative permeability ratio, for a given rock, it is mainly a function of the fluid saturations.

Only water will be produced from a well completed in the true water zone, and only oil will be produced from the true oil zone. In the transition zone (Fig. 10.3), both oil and water will be produced, and the fraction that is water will depend on the oil and water saturations at the point of completion.

The fractional flow in surface flow rate units, or surface watercut,.

Mobility Ratio = Water/Oil.

Heterogeneities and anisotropy, mobility of the displacing fluids compared with the mobility of the displaced fluids, the physical arrangement of injection and production wells, and the type of rock matrix in which the oil or gas exists.

Where such permeability stratification exists, the displacing water sweeps faster through the more permeable zones so that much of the oil in the less permeable zones must be produced over a long period of time at high water-oil ratios. The.

Where such permeability stratification exists, the displacing water sweeps faster through the more permeable zones so that much of the oil in the less permeable zones must be produced over a long period of time at high water-oil ratios.

The movement of fluids through the reservoir will not be uniform if there are large variations in such properties as porosity, permeability, and clay cement.

Mobility is a relative measure of how easily a fluid moves through porous media.

When a fluid is being injected into a porous medium containing both the injected fluid and a second fluid, the apparent mobility of the displacing phase is usually measured at the average displacing phase saturation when the displacing phase just begins to break through at the production site.

A phenomenon called viscous fingering can take place if the mobility of the displacing phase is much greater than the mobility of the displaced phase. Viscous fingering simply refers to the penetration of the much more mobile displacing phase into the phase that is being displaced.

The arrangement of injection and production wells depends primarily on the geology of the formation and the size (areal extent) of the reservoir.

Knowledge of any directional permeability effects and other heterogeneities can aid in the consideration of well arrangements.

Limestone formations are associated with connate water that can have high levels of divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2.

Limestone formations are associated with connate water that can have high levels of divalent ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Vugular porosity and high-divalent ion content in their connate waters hinder the application of injection processes in limestone reservoirs.

Pcow = Po - Pw = Pnm - Pw.

The flowing water-oil ratio at reservoir conditions depends on the viscosity ratio and the effective permeability ratio (i.e., on the mobility ratio),.

Oil is displaced from a rock by water similar to how fluid is displaced from a cylinder by a leaky piston.

Let the total throughput, q′ = qwBw + qoBo, in reservoir barrels be the same at all cross sections.

For the present, we will neglect gravitational and capillary forces that may be acting.

The oil saturation will be slightly higher at the right-hand face, so the fraction of water flowing there will be slightly less, or fw – dfw. Then the rate of water leaving the element is . The net rate of gain of water in the element at any time, then, is.

.

Then if oil is being displaced from the element, at time (t + dt), the water saturation will be (Sw + dSw).

For a given rock, the fraction of water fw is a function only of the water saturation Sw.

This means that the distance a plane of constant saturation, Sw, advances is directly proportional to time and to the value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) at that saturation,.

The value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) may be obtained for any value of water saturation, Sw, by plotting fw from Eq. (10.5) versus Sw and graphically taking the slopes at values of.

The value of the derivative (∂fw/∂Sw) may be obtained for any value of water saturation, Sw, by plotting fw from Eq. (10.5) versus Sw and graphically taking the slopes at values of Sw.

The saturation can be only one value at any place and time. The difficulty is resolved by dropping perpendiculars so that the areas to the right (A) equal the areas to the left (B), as shown in Fig. 10.10.

The area to the right of the flood front in Fig. 10.11 is commonly called the oil bank and the area to the left is sometimes called the drag zone.

Well in this reservoir unit will produce water-free oil until the flood front approaches the well.

Thereafter, in a relatively short period, the watercut will rise sharply and be followed by a relatively long period of production at high, and increasingly higher, watercuts.

When a producing formation consists of two or more rather definite strata, or stringers, of different permeabilities, the rates of advance in the separate strata will be proportional to their permeabilities, and the overall effect will be a combination of several separate displacements, such as described for a single homogeneous stratum.

Due to the high oil-gas viscosity ratios and the high gas-oil relative permeability ratios at low gas saturations, the displacement efficiency by gas is generally much lower than that by water, unless the gas displacement is accompanied by substantial gravitational segregation. This.

Due to the high oil-gas viscosity ratios and the high gas-oil relative permeability ratios at low gas saturations, the displacement efficiency by gas is generally much lower than that by water, unless the gas displacement is accompanied by substantial gravitational segregation.

The effect of gravitational segregation in water-drive oil reservoirs is usually of much less concern because of the higher displacement efficiencies and the lower oil-water density differences, whereas the converse is generally true for gas-oil systems.

One interesting application of gravity segregation is to the recovery of updip or “attic” oil in active water-drive reservoirs possessing good gravity segregation characteristics.

When the structurally highest well(s) has gone to water production, high-pressure gas is injected for a period. This gas migrates updip and displaces the oil downdip, where it may be produced from the same well in which the gas was injected. The injected gas is, of course, unrecoverable.

(1) the water viscosity is of the order of 50 times the gas viscosity and (2) the water occupies the less conductive portions of the pore spaces, whereas the gas occupies the more conductive portions.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, and gravity drainage.

“one or more of a variety of processes that seek to improve recovery of hydrocarbon from a reservoir after the primary production phase.”.

These EOR techniques have been lumped into two categories—secondary and tertiary recovery processes.

Process that is not discussed in this text is the use of pumpjacks at the end of primary.

A process that is not discussed in this text is the use of pumpjacks at the end of primary production. A pumpjack is basically a device used with a downhole pump to help lift oil from the reservoir when the reservoir pressure has been depleted to a point where the oil cannot travel to the surface. Most producing companies will employ this technology, but it is not considered an enhanced oil recovery process.

On the average, primary production methods will produce from a reservoir about 25% to 30% of the initial oil in place. The remaining oil, 70% to 75% of the initial resource, is a large and attractive target for enhanced oil recovery techniques.

Gasflooding has proven very useful with reservoirs with a gas cap and where the hydrocarbon formation has a significant dip structure to it.

Waterflooding recovers oil by the water moving through the reservoir as a bank of fluid and “pushing” oil ahead of.

Waterflooding recovers oil by the water moving through the reservoir as a bank of fluid and “pushing” oil ahead of it.

The recovery efficiency of a waterflood is largely a function of the sweep efficiency of the flood and the ratio of the oil and water viscosities.

Sweep efficiency, as discussed in Chapter 10, is a measure of how well the water has contacted the available pore space in the oil-bearing zone.

Fractures, high-permeability streaks, and faults are examples of gross heterogeneities.

When injected water is much less viscous than the oil it is meant to displace, the water could begin to finger or channel through the reservoir.

This fingering or channeling is referred to as viscous fingering and may lead to significant bypassing of residual oil and lower flooding efficiencies. This bypassing of residual oil is an important issue in applying any enhanced oil recovery technique, including waterflooding.

When gas is the pressure maintenance agent, it is usually injected into a zone of free gas (i.e., a gas cap) to maximize recovery by gravity drainage.

The injected gas is usually produced natural gas from the reservoir in question.

Reservoir characteristics and fluid characteristics.

The main reservoir characteristics that affect a waterflood are depth, structure, homogeneity, and petrophysical properties such as porosity, saturation, and average permeability.

First, investment and operating costs generally increase as the depth increases, as a result of the increase in drilling and lifting costs.

Second, the reservoir must be deep enough for the injection pressure to be less than the fracture pressure of the reservoir.

If the reservoir has a dipped structure, gravity effects can often be used to increase sweep efficiencies.

The average reservoir permeability should be high enough to allow sufficient fluid injection without parting or fracturing the reservoir.

(2) take advantage of the reservoir characteristics, such as dip, faults, fractures, and permeability trends. In.

Pattern flooding is used in reservoirs having a small dip and a large surface.

Pattern flooding is used in reservoirs having a small dip and a large surface area.

The reservoir characteristics yield lower injection rates than those desired, the operator should consider using either a seven- or a nine-spot pattern, where there are more injection wells per pattern than producing wells. A similar argument can be made for using a four-spot pattern in a reservoir with low flow rates in the production wells.

Schematic of an anticlinal reservoir with an underlying aquifer is shown. The injectors are placed so that the injected water either enters the aquifer or is near.

The injectors are placed so that the injected water either enters the aquifer or is near the aquifer-reservoir interface.

These include horizontal wells and injection pressures above the reservoir fracturing pressure.

A successful waterflood in a typical reservoir results in oil recoveries increasing from 25% after primary recovery to 30% to 33% overall.

Since a gas is typically much less viscous than oil, viscous fingering of the gas phase through the oil phase may occur, resulting in poor sweep efficiencies and low oil recoveries.

Tertiary oil recovery refers to the process of producing liquid hydrocarbons by methods other than the conventional use of reservoir.

(1) miscible flooding processes, (2) chemical flooding processes, and (3) thermal flooding processes.

Miscible displacement includes single-contact and multiple-contact miscible processes.

Chemical processes are polymer, micellar polymer, alkaline flooding, and microbial flooding.

Thermal processes include hot water, steam cycling, steam drive, and in situ combustion.

In general, thermal processes are applicable in reservoirs containing heavy crude oils, whereas chemical and miscible displacement processes are used in reservoirs containing light crude oils.

The mobilization of oil is governed by the viscous forces (pressure gradients) and the interfacial tension forces that exist in the sand grain–oil–water system.

The capillary number is the ratio of the viscous force to the interfacial tension force.

The capillary number increases as the viscous force increases or as the interfacial tension force decreases.

The correlation suggests that a capillary number greater than 10–5 for the mobilization of unconnected oil droplets is necessary.

The tertiary methods that have been developed and applied to reservoir situations are designed either to increase the viscous force associated with the injected fluid or to decrease the interfacial tension force between the injected fluid and the reservoir oil.

Miscible flooding, chemical flooding, thermal flooding, and microbial flooding.

Microscopic displacement efficiency is largely a function of interfacial forces acting between the oil, rock, and displacing fluid.

The interfacial tension between the trapped oil and displacing fluid could be lowered.

If the interfacial tension between the trapped oil and displacing fluid could be lowered.

The oil droplets could be deformed and squeeze through the pore constrictions.

A miscible process is one in which the interfacial tension is zero—that is, the displacing fluid and residual oil mix to form one phase. If the interfacial tension is zero, then the capillary number NVC becomes infinite and the microscopic displacement efficiency is maximized.

The first type is referred to as the single-contact miscible process and involves such injection fluids.

The first type is referred to as the single-contact miscible process and involves such injection fluids as liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) and alcohols.

The second type is the multiple-contact, or dynamic, miscible process.

The injected fluid and oil are usually not miscible on first contact but rely on a process of chemical exchange of the intermediate hydrocarbons between phases to achieve miscibility.

The injected fluids in this case are usually methane, inert fluids, or an enriched methane gas supplemented with a C2-C6 fraction; this fraction of alkanes has the unique ability to behave like a liquid or a gas at many reservoir conditions.

Gas could be mixed with either a liquid or a vapor in appropriate percentages and yield a miscible system.

However, when liquid is mixed with a vapor, often the result is a composition in the two-phase region.

Saturation has been decreased and exists partly as a continuous phase in some pore channels but as discontinuous droplets in other channels.

The oil exists primarily as a discontinuous phase of droplets or globules that have been isolated and trapped by the displacing brine.

The residual oil exists as a film around the sand grains. In the smaller flow channels, this film may occupy the entire void space.

The waterflooding of oil in an oil-wet system yields a different fluid distribution at Sor. Early in the waterflood, the brine forms continuous flow paths through the center portions of some of the pore channels. The brine enters more and more of the pore channels as the waterflood progresses. At residual oil saturation, the brine has entered a sufficient number of pore channels to shut off the oil flow. The residual oil exists as a film around the sand grains. In the smaller flow channels, this film may occupy the entire void space.

The mobilization of the residual oil saturation in a water-wet system requires that the discontinuous globules be connected to form a continuous flow channel that leads to a producing well.

In an oil-wet porous medium, the film of oil around the sand grains must be displaced to large pore channels and be connected in a continuous phase before it can be mobilized.

There have been several investigations of the effect of viscous forces and interfacial tension forces on the trapping and mobilization of residual oil.

Consider a miscible process with n-decane as the residual oil, propane as fluid A, and methane as fluid B.

The phase behavior of hydrocarbon systems can be described through the use of ternary diagrams.

Crude oil phase behavior can typically be represented reasonably well by three fractions of the crude.

One fraction is methane (C1).

Second fraction is a mixture of ethane through hexane (C2-C6.

The third fraction is the remaining hydrocarbon species lumped together and called C7+.

A gas could be mixed with either a liquid or a vapor in appropriate percentages and yield a miscible system.

Multiple-contact or dynamic miscible processes do not require the oil and displacing fluid to be miscible immediately on contact but rely on chemical exchange between the two phases for miscibility to be achieved.

Chemical flooding processes involve the addition of one or more chemical compounds to an injected fluid either to reduce the interfacial tension between the reservoir oil and injected fluid or to improve the sweep efficiency of the injected fluid by making it more viscous, thereby improving the mobility ratio.

Both mechanisms are designed to increase the capillary number.

The first is polymer flooding, in which a large macromolecule is used to increase the displacing fluid viscosity.

The remaining two methods, micellar-polymer flooding and alkaline flooding, make use of chemicals that reduce the interfacial tension between oil and a displacing fluid.

The addition of large molecular weight molecules called polymers to an injected water can often increase the effectiveness of a conventional waterflood.

In a flooding application, the increased viscosity will alter the mobility ratio between the injected fluid and the reservoir oil.

The improved mobility ratio will lead to better vertical and areal sweep efficiencies and thus higher oil recoveries.

These are synthetically produced polyacrylamides and biologically produced polysaccharides.

Polysaccharides are less susceptible to both mechanical shear and salt. Since they are produced biologically, care must be taken to prevent biological degradation in the reservoir. As a rule, polysaccharides are more expensive than polyacrylamides.

Polymer flooding has not been successful in high-temperature reservoirs. Neither polymer type has exhibited sufficiently long-term stability above 160°F in moderate-salinity or heavy-salinity brines.

Polymer flooding has the best application in moderately heterogeneous reservoirs and reservoirs containing oils with viscosities less than 100 centipoise (cp).

Since the use of polymers does not affect the microscopic displacement efficiency, the improvement in oil recovery will be due to improved sweep efficiency over what is obtained during a conventional waterflood.

The basic micellar-polymer process uses a surfactant to lower the interfacial tension between the injected fluid and the reservoir.

Surfactant is a surface-active agent that contains a hydrophobic (“dislikes” water) part to the molecule and a hydrophilic (“likes” water) part. The surfactant migrates to the interface between the oil and water phases and helps make the two phases more miscible.

When surfactants are mixed above a critical saturation in a water-oil system, the result is a stable mixture called a micellar solution.

(1) phase behavior studies,.

(2) interfacial tension studies,.

(3) oil displacement studies.

When an alkaline solution is mixed with certain crude oils, surfactant molecules are formed.

When the formation of surfactant molecules occurs in situ, the interfacial tension between the brine and oil phases could be reduced.

The reduction of interfacial tension causes the microscopic displacement efficiency to increase, thereby increasing oil recovery.

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) flooding involves the injection of microorganisms that react with reservoir fluids to assist in the production of residual oil.

There are two general types of MEOR processes—those in which microorganisms react with reservoir fluids to generate surfactants or those in which microorganisms react with reservoir fluids to generate polymers.

The success of MEOR processes will be highly dependent on reservoir characteristics.

Most pilot projects have involved an application of the huff and puff or thermal-cycling process discussed with regard to thermal flooding.

When oil is produced during the huff stage, oil from lower permeability zones will be produced.

(1) screening of chemicals to optimize the microscopic displacement efficiency, (2) contacting the oil in the reservoir, and (3) maintaining good mobility in order to lessen the effects of viscous fingering.

The study of the properties of rocks and their relationship to the fluids they contain in both the static and flowing states is called petrophysics.

The symbol N (coming from the Greek word naptha) represents the initial volume of oil in the reservoir expressed as a standard surface volume, such as the stock-tank barrel (STB).

Of course, if the cricondentherm of a fluid is below approximately 50°F, then only gas will exist on the surface at usual ambient temperatures, and the production will be called dry gas. Nevertheless, even dry gas may contain valuable liquid fractions that can be removed by low-temperature separation.

As pressure declines due to production, the composition of the produced fluid will be the same as reservoir A and will remain constant until the dew-point pressure is reached at 2700 psia, point B1. Below this pressure, a liquid condenses out of the reservoir fluid as a fog or dew. This type of reservoir is commonly called a dew-point or a gas-condensate reservoir. This condensation leaves the gas phase with a lower liquid content.

The condensed liquid remains immobile at low concentrations. Thus the gas produced at the surface will have a lower liquid content, and the producing gas-oil ratio therefore rises. This process of retrograde condensation continues until a point of maximum liquid volume is reached, 10% at 2250 psia, point B2. The term retrograde is used because generally vaporization, rather than condensation, occurs during isothermal expansion. After the dew point is reached, because the composition of the produced fluid changes, the composition of the remaining reservoir fluid also changes, and the phase envelope begins to shift.

The overall retrograde loss will evidently be greater (1) for lower reservoir temperatures, (2) for higher abandonment pressures, and (3) for greater shift of the phase diagram to the right—the latter being a property of the hydrocarbon system.

The curves within the two-phase envelope show the percentage of the total hydrocarbon volume that is liquid for any temperature and pressure.

Although the fluid left in the reservoir remains in one phase, the fluid produced through the wellbore and into surface separators, although the same composition, may enter the two-phase region owing to the temperature decline, as along line.

This accounts for the production of condensate liquid at the surface from a single-phase gas phase in the reservoir.

Finally, if the initial hydrocarbon mixture occurred at 2000 psia and 150°F, point D, it would be a two-phase reservoir, consisting of a liquid or oil zone overlain by a gas zone or cap.

The liquid or oil zone will be at its bubble point and will be produced as a bubble-point reservoir modified by the presence of the gas cap.

The gas cap will be at the dew point and may be either retrograde, as shown in Fig. 1.5(a), or nonretrograde, as shown in Fig. 1.5(b.

From this technical point of view, hydrocarbon reservoirs are initially either in a single-phase state (A, B, or C) or in a two-phase state (D), depending on their temperatures and pressures relative to their phase envelopes.

Production with gas-oil ratios greater than 100,000 SCF/STB is commonly called lean or dry gas, although there is no generally recognized dividing line between the two categories.

The term wet gas is sometimes used interchangeably with gas condensate.

Although there is good correlation between the molecular weight of the heptanes plus and the gravity of the stock-tank liquid, there is virtually no correlation between the gas-oil ratios and the gravities of the stock-tank liquids, except that most black oil reservoirs have gas-oil ratios below 1000 SCF/STB and stock-tank liquid gravities below 45 °API.

The gas-oil ratios are a good indication of the overall composition of the fluid, high gas-oil ratios being associated with low concentrations of pentanes and heavier and vice versa.

That something could be the swelling of the remaining hydrocarbon due to a drop in reservoir pressure, the encroachment of water from a neighboring aquifer, or the expansion of formation.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, gravity drainage, and formation expansion. When.

Sources of natural reservoir energy that lead to primary production include the swelling of reservoir fluids, the release of solution gas as the reservoir pressure declines, nearby communicating aquifers, gravity drainage, and formation expansion.

When there is water influx from the aquifer and the reservoir pressure remains near the initial reservoir pressure, recovery is accomplished by a displacement mechanism, which again may be aided by gravitational drainage.

The recovery efficiency of a waterflood is largely a function of the macroscopic sweep efficiency of the flood and the microscopic pore scale displacement behavior that is largely governed by the ratio of the oil and water viscosities.

For most reservoirs, it is advantageous to begin a secondary or a tertiary process before primary production is completed.

For these reservoirs, the term enhanced oil recovery was introduced and has become popular in reference to any recovery process that, in general, improves the recovery over what the natural reservoir energy would be expected to yield.

Porosity values range from 10% to 40% for sandstone type reservoirs and 5% to 15% for limestone type reservoirs.

The total porosity represents the total void space of the medium. The effective porosity is the amount of the void space that contributes to the flow of fluids.

The average porosity is seldom known more precisely than to 1% porosity (e.g., to 5% accuracy at 20% porosity). The porosity is also calculated from indirect methods using well log data, often with the assistance of some core measurements.

Logging techniques have the advantage of averaging larger volumes of rock than in core analysis.

The equation describes the change in volume that a substance undergoes during a change in pressure while the temperature is held constant.

When the internal fluid pressure within the pore spaces of a rock,.

Is reduced, the bulk volume of the rock decreases while the volume of the solid rock material (e.g., the sand grains of a sandstone) increases.

Change in porosity for a given rock depends only on the difference between the internal and external pressures and not on the absolute value of the pressures.

Change in pore volume is nonlinear and the pore volume compressibility is not constant.

The values for limestone and sandstone reservoir rocks lie in the range of 2 × 10–6 to 25 × 10–6 psi.

The direct approach involves either the extraction of the reservoir fluids or the leaching of the fluids from a sample of the reservoir rock.

The indirect approach relies on a measurement of some other property, such as capillary pressure, and the derivation of a mathematical relationship between the measured property and saturation.

Direct methods include retorting the fluids from the rock, distilling the fluids with a modified American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) procedure, and centrifuging the fluids.

Each method relies on some procedure to remove the rock sample from the reservoir.

The indirect methods use logging or capillary pressure measurements.

The petroleum industry works with a set of standard conditions—usually 14.7 psia and 60°F.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF. A quantity of a pure gas can be expressed as the number.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF. A.

The volume that 1 lb-mol occupies at standard conditions is 379.4 SCF.

Because it is more convenient to measure the specific gravity of gases than the gas density, specific gravity is more commonly used.

Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the density of a gas at a given temperature and pressure to the density of air at the same temperature and pressure, usually near 60°F and atmospheric pressure.

Whereas the density of gases varies with temperature and pressure, the specific gravity is independent of temperature and pressure when the gas obeys the ideal gas law.

All molecules of real gases have two tendencies: (1) to fly apart from each other because of their constant kinetic motion and (2) to come together because of electrical attractive forces between the molecules.

When the volume of a gas will be less than what the ideal gas volume would be, the gas is said to be supercompressible.

The number, which measures the gas’s deviation from perfect behavior, is sometimes called the supercompressibility factor, usually shortened to the gas compressibility factor.

This dimensionless quantity usually varies between 0.70 and 1.20, with a value of 1.00 representing ideal behavior.

At very high pressures, above about 5000 psia, natural gases pass from a supercompressible condition to one in which compression is more difficult than in the ideal gas.

Definition the ratio of the volume actually occupied by a gas at a given pressure and temperature to the volume it would occupy if it behaved ideally,.

Without a bottom-hole fluid sample, produced wet gas or gas condensate may be recombined at the surface. This may be accomplished by recombining samples of separator gas, stock-tank gas, and stock-tank liquid in the proportions in which they are produced.

For wet gas or gas condensate, the deviation factor may be measured for differentially liberated gas below the dew-point pressure.

For reservoir oil, the deviation factor of solution gas is measured on gas samples evolved from solution in the oil during a differential liberation process.

The gas deviation factor is commonly determined by measuring the volume of a sample at desired pressures and temperatures and then measuring the volume of the same mass of gas at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature sufficiently high so that all the material remains in the vapor phase.

If the gas deviation factor is not measured, it may be estimated from its specific gravity.

The gas formation volume factor (Bg) relates the volume of gas in the reservoir to the volume on the surface (i.e., at standard conditions psc and Tsc.

These gas volume factors mean that 1 std ft3 (at 14.7 psia and 60°F) will occupy 0.00533 ft3 of space in the reservoir at 3250 psia and 213°F.

Sometimes it is useful to introduce the concept of gas compressibility. This must not be confused with the gas deviation factor, which is also referred to as the gas compressibility factor.

The change in volume with pressure for gases under isothermal conditions, which is closely realized in reservoir gas flow,.

For an ideal gas, z = 1.00 and dz/dp = 0, and the compressibility is simply the reciprocal of the pressure.

An ideal gas at 1000 psia, then, has a compressibility of 1/1000 or 1000 × 10–6 psi.

The viscosity of natural gas depends on the temperature, pressure, and composition of the gas.

Is not commonly measured in the laboratory because it can be estimated with good precision.

It is not commonly measured in the laboratory because it can be estimated with good precision.

Carr, Kobayashi, and Burrows have developed correlation charts, Figs. 2.6 and 2.7, for estimating the viscosity of natural gas from the pseudoreduced temperature and pressure.

There are two main reasons for the oil correlations being less reliable. The first is that oils usually consist of many more components than gases. Whereas gases are mostly made up of alkanes, oils can be made up of several different classes of compounds (e.g., aromatics and paraffins). The second reason is that mixtures of liquid components exhibit more nonidealities than mixtures of gas components. These nonidealities can lead to errors in extrapolating correlations that have been developed for a certain database of samples to particular applications outside the database.

The amount of gas dissolved in an oil at a given pressure and temperature is referred to as the solution gas-oil ratio (Rso), in units of SCF/STB.

Unlike the solubility of, say, sodium chloride in water, gas is infinitely soluble in crude oil, the quantity being limited only by the pressure or by the quantity of gas available.

Crude oil is said to be saturated with gas at any pressure and temperature if, on a slight reduction in pressure, some gas is released from the solution.

Conversely, if no gas is released from the solution, the crude oil is said to be undersaturated at that pressure.

The undersaturated state implies that there is a deficiency of gas present and that, had there been an abundance of gas present, the oil would be saturated at that pressure. The undersaturated state further implies that there is no free gas in contact with the crude oil (i.e., there is no gas cap).

Will be shown that the reservoir volume of crude oil increases appreciably because of the solution gas, and for this reason, the quantity of solution gas is usually referenced to a unit of stock-tank oil and the solution gas-oil ratio (Rso) is expressed in standard cubic feet per stock-tank barrel.

The graph indicates that no gas is evolved from the solution when the pressure drops from the initial pressure to 2500 psia. Thus the oil is undersaturated in this region, and there can be no free gas phase (gas cap) in the reservoir.

Solution gas-oil ratio and other fluid properties depend on the manner by which the gas is liberated from the oil.

One obvious implication of the formation volume factor is that for every 1.310 bbl of reservoir liquid in the Big Sandy reservoir, only 1.000 bbl, or 76.3%, can reach the stock tank.

This figure (76.3% or 0.763) is the reciprocal of the formation volume factor and is called the shrinkage factor. Just as the formation volume factor is multiplied by the stock-tank volume to find the reservoir volume, the shrinkage factor is multiplied by the reservoir volume to find the stock-tank volume.

The formation volume factors depend on the type of gas liberation process—.

It is convenient to use the term two-phase formation volume factor (Bt), which is defined as the volume in barrels one stock-tank barrel and its initial complement of dissolved gas occupies at any pressure and reservoir temperature.

In other words, it includes the liquid volume, Bo, plus the volume of the difference between the initial solution gas-oil ratio, Rsoi, and the solution gas-oil ratio at the specified pressure, Rso.

Above the bubble point, pressure Rsoi = Rso and the single-phase and two-phase factors are equal. Below the bubble point,.

Is commonly reported for reference to the smaller volume—that is, the volume at the higher pressure.

It is commonly reported for reference to the smaller volume—that is, the volume at the higher pressure.

Below the bubble point, the viscosity decreases with increasing pressure owing to the thinning effect of gas entering solution, but above the bubble point, the viscosity increases with increasing pressure. Figure 2.11 The viscosity of four crude oil samples.

Below the bubble point, the viscosity decreases with increasing pressure owing to the thinning effect of gas entering solution, but above the bubble point, the viscosity increases with increasing pressure.

When it is necessary to estimate the viscosity of reservoir oils, correlations have been developed for both above and below the bubble-point pressure.

The correlation is for what is referred to as “dead” oil, which simply means it does not contain solution gas.

The viscosity of water increases with decreasing temperature and in general with increasing pressure and salinity.

Water and formation compressibilities are generally neglected, except in undersaturated reservoirs producing above the bubble point. A term accounting for the change in water and formation.

Water and formation compressibilities are generally neglected, except in undersaturated reservoirs producing above the bubble point.

The general material balance equation is simply a volumetric balance, which states that since the volume of a reservoir (as defined by its initial limits) is a constant, the algebraic sum of the volume changes of the oil, free gas, water, and rock volumes in the reservoir must be zero.

In making these calculations, the following production, reservoir, and laboratory data are involved:.

The initial reservoir pressure and the average reservoir pressure at successive intervals after the start of production.

The stock-tank barrels of oil produced, measured at 1 atm and 60°F, at any time or during any production interval.

The total standard cubic feet of gas produced. When gas is injected into the reservoir, this will be the difference between the total gas produced and that returned to the reservoir.

The ratio of the initial gas cap volume and the initial oil volume, m:.

The value of m can be determined with reasonable precision, there is only one unknown (N) in the material balance on volumetric gas cap reservoirs and two (N and We) in water-drive reservoirs.

If the value of m can be determined with reasonable precision, there is only one unknown (N) in the material balance on volumetric gas cap reservoirs and two (N and We) in water-drive reservoirs.

The value of m is determined from log and core data and from well completion data, which frequently helps to locate the gas-oil and water-oil contacts.

The ratio m is known in many instances much more accurately than the absolute values of the gas cap and oil zone volumes.

The gas and oil formation volume factors and the solution gas-oil ratios. These are obtained as functions of pressure by laboratory measurements on bottom-hole samples by the differential and flash liberation methods.

The quantity of water that has been produced.

The quantity of water that has been encroached into the reservoir from the aquifer.

Oil expansion is derived from the product of the initial oil in place and the change in the two-phase oil formation volume factor.

Gas expansion is similar; however, additional terms are needed to convert the initial oil in place to initial gas in place—both free gas and dissolved gas.

Determining the initial hydrocarbon in place.

Calculating water influx.

Predicting reservoir pressures.

One of the most important uses of the equations is predicting the effect of cumulative production and/or injection (gas or water) on reservoir pressure; therefore, it is very desirable to know in advance the initial oil and the ratio m from good core and log data.

Unless other complicating factors are present, the constancy in the calculated value of N and/or G indicates a volumetric reservoir, and continually changing values of N and G indicate a water drive.

Wieland and Kennedy have found a tendency for the liquid phase to remain supersaturated with gas as the pressure declines.

The effect of supersaturation causes reservoir pressure for a given volume of production to be lower than it otherwise would have been, had equilibrium been attained.

Another source of error is introduced in the determination of average reservoir pressure at the end of any production interval.

For thicker formations with higher permeabilities and oils of lower viscosities, where final buildup pressures are readily and accurately obtained and when there are only small pressure differences across the reservoir, reliable values of average reservoir pressure are easily obtained.

On the other hand, for thinner formations of lower permeability and oils of higher viscosity, difficulties are met in obtaining accurate final buildup pressures, and there are often large pressure variations throughout the reservoir.

These are commonly averaged by preparing isobaric maps superimposed on isopach maps.

Also, difficulties are encountered when production from two or more vertically isolated zones or strata of different productivity are commingled. In this case, the pressures are generally higher in the strata of low productivity, and because the measured pressures are nearer to those in the zones of high productivity, the measured static pressures tend to be lower and the reservoir behaves as if it contained less oil.

The effect of pressure errors on calculated values of initial oil or water influx depends on the size of the errors in relation to the reservoir pressure decline.

Because water influx and gas cap expansion tend to offset pressure decline, the pressure errors are more serious than for the undersaturated depletion reservoirs.

In the case of very active water drives and gas caps that are large compared with the associated oil zone, the material balance is useless to determine the initial oil in place because of the very small pressure decline.

Uncertainties in the ratio of the initial free gas volume to the initial reservoir oil volume also affect the calculations.

Larger gas caps reduce the effect of pressure decline. For quite large gas caps relative to the oil zone, the material balance approaches a gas balance modified slightly by production from the oil zone.

Well tests are often useful in locating gas-oil and water-oil contacts in the determination of m.

When two or more wells completed in different reservoirs are producing to common storage, unless there are individual meters on the wells, only the aggregate production is known and not the individual oil production from each reservoir.

Normally, when using the material balance equation, an engineer considers each pressure and the corresponding production data as being separate points from other pressure values. From each separate point, a calculation for a dependent variable is made. The results of the calculations are sometimes averaged. The Havlena-Odeh method uses all the data points, with the further requirement that these points must yield solutions to the material balance equation that behave linearly to obtain values of the independent variable.

The tendency for condensate to form on the surface increases as the concentration of heavier components increases in the reservoir fluid.

This unit recovery is the difference between the initial gas in place and the gas remaining in the reservoir at the time of abandonment and represents the total gas that can be produced from the reservoir.

Two main mechanisms in gas reservoirs will be discussed in this chapter. They are gas drive, which is the expansion of the gas in the reservoir due to a drop in reservoir pressure as gas is being produced, and water drive, which is the encroachment of water in the reservoir due to contact with an aquifer.

In the case of a gas drive, there is neither water encroachment into nor water production from the reservoir of interest, and the reservoir is said to be volumetric.

A subsurface contour map shows lines connecting points of equal elevations on the top of a marker bed and therefore shows geologic structure.

Net isopach map shows lines connecting points of equal net formation thickness, and the individual lines connecting points of equal thickness are called isopach lines.

A net isopach map shows lines connecting points of equal net formation thickness, and the individual lines connecting points of equal thickness are called isopach lines.

The contact line is the zero isopach line.

The volume is obtained by planimetering the areas between the isopach lines of the entire reservoir or of the individual units under consideration.

The standard cubic feet of gas in a reservoir with a gas pore volume of Vg ft3 is simply Vg/Bg.

Since obtaining the average pressure of the hydrocarbon contents is the important piece of data, the volumetric average, Eq. (4.4), should be used in the calculations for bulk hydrocarbon volume. Where the pressure gradients in the reservoir are small, the average pressures obtained with Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) will be very close to the volumetric average.

Since obtaining the average pressure of the hydrocarbon contents is the important piece of data, the volumetric average, Eq. (4.4), should be used in the calculations for bulk hydrocarbon volume. Where the pressure gradients in the reservoir are small, the average pressures obtained with Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) will be very close to the volumetric average. Where the gradients are large, there may be considerable differences.

For a reservoir under volumetric control, there is no change in the interstitial water,.

For a reservoir under volumetric control, there is no change in the interstitial water, so the reservoir gas volume remains the same.

Some gas pipeline companies use an abandonment pressure of 100 psi per 1000 ft of depth.

The water drive is very active and, as a result, there is essentially no decline in reservoir pressure, unit recovery and the recovery factor become.

Because the residual gas saturation is independent of the pressure, the recovery will be greater for the lower stabilization pressure.

The residual gas saturation can be measured in the laboratory on representative core samples.

In calculating the gas reserve of a particular lease or unit, the gas that can be recovered by the well(s) on the lease is important rather than the total recoverable gas initially underlying the lease, some of which may be recovered by adjacent wells. In volumetric reservoirs where the recoverable gas.

In calculating the gas reserve of a particular lease or unit, the gas that can be recovered by the well(s) on the lease is important rather than the total recoverable gas initially underlying the lease, some of which may be recovered by adjacent wells.

In volumetric reservoirs where the recoverable gas beneath each lease (well) is the same, the recoveries will be the same only if all wells are produced at the same rate.

On the other hand, if wells are produced at equal rates when the gas beneath the leases (wells) varies, as from variable formation thickness, the calculated initial gas reserve of the lease, where the formation is thicker, will be less than the initial actual recoverable gas underlying the lease.

For most gas reservoirs, the gas compressibility term is much greater than the formation and water compressibilities, and the second term on the left-hand side of Eq. (3.10) becomes negligible:.

When reservoir pressures are abnormally high, this term is not negligible and should not be ignored. This situation is discussed in a later section of this chapter.

Because of the water influx, the pressure drops less rapidly with production than under volumetric control, as.

Also, where there is water influx, the initial gas in place calculated at successive stages of depletion, assuming no water influx, takes on successively higher values, whereas with volumetric reservoirs the calculated values of the initial gas should remain substantially constant.

The produced hydrocarbon liquid is converted to its gas equivalent, assuming it behaves as an ideal gas when vaporized in the produced gas.

When water is produced on the surface as a condensate from the gas phase in the reservoir, it is freshwater and should be converted to a gas equivalent and added to the gas production.

It would appear that any freshwater produced in excess of the initial content should be treated as produced water and taken care of in the Wp term rather than the Gp term.

Since this additional content has come from vaporization of the connate water, it would appear that any freshwater produced in excess of the initial content should be treated as produced water and taken care of in the Wp term rather than the Gp term.

(1) verification of inventory, (2) retention against migration, and (3) assurance of deliverability.

Verification of inventory simply means knowing the storage capacity of the reservoir as a function of pressure. This suggests that a p/z plot or some other measure of material balance be known for the reservoir of interest.

Retention against migration refers to a monitoring system capable of ascertaining if the injected gas remains in the storage reservoir.

Normal pressure gradients observed in gas reservoirs are in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 psi per foot of depth. Reservoirs with abnormal pressures may have gradients as high as 0.7 to 1.0 psi per foot of depth.

When the water and formation compressibility term in the material balance equation can be ignored, the normal p/z behavior for a volumetric gas reservoir plots a straight line versus cumulative gas produced (Fig. 4.2).

This is not the case for an abnormally pressured gas reservoir, as can be seen in Fig. 4.6, which illustrates the p/z behavior for this type of reservoir.

For an abnormally pressured volumetric reservoir, the p/z plot is a straight line during the early life of production, but then it usually curves downward during the later stages of production.

The early data are used to extrapolate for G or for an abandonment Gp, the extrapolation can yield significant errors.

“rock collapse” theory that used a high rock compressibility at abnormally high pressures and a reduced rock compressibility at normal reservoir pressures.

Bernard has proposed a method of analyzing the p/z curve for abnormally pressured reservoirs to determine initial gas in place and gas reserve as a function of abandonment p/z.

The apparent gas in place is obtained by extrapolating the early, linear p/z data.

The error in gas production Gp arises from error in gas metering, in the estimate of lease use and leakage, and in the estimate of the low-pressure separator or stock-tank gases.

The precision of the initial gas in place depends on the probable errors in the averages of the porosity, connate water, pressure, and gas deviation factor and in the error in the determination of the bulk productive volume.

The reserve is the product of the gas in place and the recovery factor.

When the reservoir exhibits permeability stratification, the difficulties are increased and the accuracy is therefore reduced.

In general, reserve calculations are more accurate for volumetric than for water-drive reservoirs.

Sometimes underground leakage occurs—from the failure in casing cementing, from casing corrosion, or, in the case of dual completions, from leakage between the two zones.

Pressure errors are a result of gauge errors and the difficulties in averaging, particularly when there are large pressure differences throughout the reservoir.

Water production with gas wells is frequently unreported when the amount is small; when it is appreciable, it is often estimated from periodic well tests.

Gas-condensate production is predominantly gas from which more or less liquid is condensed in the surface separators—hence the name gas condensate.

Gas-condensate reservoirs may be approximately defined as those that produce light-colored or colorless stock-tank liquids with gravities above 45 °API at gas-oil ratios in the range of 5000 to 100,000 SCF/STB.

Oil discoveries predominated at depths less than 8000 ft, but gas and gas-condensate discoveries predominated below 10,000 ft.

For example, in a single-phase gas reservoir, reducing the reservoir pressure increases the recovery factor, and a water drive is likely to reduce the recovery factor.

In a gas-condensate reservoir, reducing the reservoir pressure below the dew-point pressure reduces condensate recovery, and therefore a water drive that maintains the reservoir pressure above the dew-point pressure will likely increase condensate recovery.

In particular, injecting water maintains pressure and displaces oil toward producing wells, but for condensate, it is better to use gas as a pressure maintenance and displacement fluid.

Since 1.20 bbl of separator liquid shrinks to 1.00 bbl in the stock tank.

When the reservoir temperature is below the cricondentherm, however, a liquid phase develops within the reservoir when pressure declines below the dew point, owing to retrograde condensation, and the treatment is considerably more complex, even for volumetric reservoirs.

The retrograde condensate liquid that forms is trapped as an immobile liquid phase within the pore spaces of the reservoir.

The oil phase is essentially immobile until it builds up to a saturation in the range of 10% to 20% of the pore space,.

In the vicinity of the wellbore, retrograde liquid saturations often build up to higher values so that there is two-phase flow, both gas and retrograde liquid.

(1) reduce, sometimes seriously, the flow rate of gas-condensate wells and (2) affect the accuracy of well samples taken, assuming one-phase flow into the wellbore.

Liquid recovery of the pentanes-plus is somewhat greater in gasoline plants than in field separation and much greater for the propanes and butanes, commonly called liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

The volumetric depletion performance of a retrograde condensate fluid, such as given in Example 5.3, may also be calculated from the initial composition of the single-phase reservoir fluid, using equilibrium ratios. An equilibrium ratio (K) is the ratio of the mole fraction (y) of any component in the vapor phase to the mole fraction (x) of the same component in the liquid phase, or K = y/x. These ratios depend on the temperature and pressure and, unfortunately, on the composition of the system.

The laboratory test on the retrograde condensate fluid in Example 5.3 is itself a material balance study of the volumetric performance of the reservoir from which the sample was taken.

Because the liquid content of many condensate reservoirs is a valuable and important part of the accumulation and because through retrograde condensation a large fraction of this liquid may be left in the reservoir at abandonment, the practice of lean gas cycling has been adopted in many condensate reservoirs.

In gas cycling, the condensate liquid is removed from the produced (wet) gas, usually in a gasoline plant, and the residue, or dry gas, is returned to the reservoir through injection wells.

When dry gas displaces wet gas within the pores of the reservoir rock, the microscopic displacement efficiency is in the range of 70% to 90%.

(1) the composition of the hydrocarbon accumulation and (2) the temperature and pressure of the accumulation in the Earth.

The initial gas and oil (condensate) for gas-condensate reservoirs, both retrograde and nonretrograde, may be calculated from generally available field data by recombining the produced gas and oil in the correct ratio to find the average specific gravity (air = 1.00) of the total well fluid, which is presumably being produced initially from a one-phase reservoir.

The composition of the total well fluid is calculated from the analyses of the produced gas(es) and liquid by recombining them in the ratio in which they are produced.

The liquid recovery is lower for the greater retrograde condensation because the retrograde liquid is generally immobile and is trapped together with some gas behind the invading waterfront.

First, there is the deferred income from the sale of the gas, which may not be produced for 10 to 20 years. Second, cycling requires additional expenditures, usually some more wells, a gas compression and distribution system to the injection wells, and a liquid recovery plant. Third, it must be realized that even when reservoir pressure is maintained above the dew point, the liquid recovery by cycling may be considerably less than 100%.

Cycling is also adopted in nonretrograde gas caps overlying oil zones, particularly when the oil is itself underlain by an active body of water. If the gas cap is produced concurrently with the oil, as the water drives the oil zone into the shrinking gas cap zone, unrecoverable oil remains not only in the original oil zone but also in that portion of the gas cap invaded by the oil.

One of the major disadvantages associated with the use of lean gas in gas-cycling applications is that the income that would be derived from the sale of the lean gas is deferred for several years.

Researchers have found that mixing nitrogen and a typical wet gas causes the dew point of the resulting mixture to be higher than the dew point of the original.

If, in a reservoir situation, the reservoir pressure is not maintained higher than this new dew point, then retrograde condensation will occur. This condensation may be as much or more than what would occur if the reservoir was not cycled with gas.

Mixing occurs as a result of molecular diffusion and dispersion forces, and the resulting mixing zone width is usually only a few feet.

Several methods are available for collecting samples of reservoir fluids. The samples may be taken with subsurface sampling equipment lowered into the well on a wire line, or samples of the gas and oil may be collected at the surface and later recombined in proportion to the gas-oil ratio measured at the time of sampling.

(2) correlations based on statistical studies of particular types of reservoir mechanisms.

For oil reservoirs under volumetric control, there is no water influx to replace the produced oil, so it must be replaced by the swelling of the oil phase or expanding gas, the saturation of which increases as the oil saturation decreases.

The total free gas saturation to be expected at abandonment can be estimated from the oil and water saturations as reported in core analysis.

The final gas saturation in most of these reservoirs ranged from 20% to 40% of the pore space, with an average saturation of 30.4%.

Since it was assumed that the reservoir pressure was maintained at its initial value by the water influx, no free gas saturation develops in the oil zone, and the oil volume factor at abandonment remains Boi. The.

The net cumulative produced gas-oil ratio (Rp) is the quotient of all the gas produced from the reservoir (Gp) and all the oil produced (Np). In some reservoirs, some of the produced gas is returned to the same reservoir, so that the net produced gas is only that which is not returned to the reservoir. When all the produced gas is returned to the reservoir, Rp is.

The net cumulative produced gas-oil ratio (Rp) is the quotient of all the gas produced from the reservoir (Gp) and all the oil produced (Np). In some reservoirs, some of the produced gas is returned to the same reservoir, so that the net produced gas is only that which is not returned to the reservoir. When all the produced gas is returned to the reservoir, Rp is zero.

The reservoir was undersaturated, so the recovery from initial pressure to bubble-point pressure is by liquid expansion and the fractional recovery at the bubble point is.

As long as this gas phase remains immobile, it can neither flow to the wellbores nor migrate upward to develop a gas cap but must remain distributed throughout the reservoir, increasing in size as the pressure declines. Because pressure changes much less rapidly with reservoir voidage for gases than for liquids, the reservoir pressure declines at a much lower rate below the bubble point.

(1) water injection into wells located along the longitudinal axis of the field and (2) shutting in the high gas-oil ratio wells and transferring their allowables to low gas-oil ratio wells. The high-ratio wells were shut in as soon as the field was unitized, and water injection was started in 1954. The operation has gone as planned, and approximately 50% of the initial oil in place has been recovered, in contrast to approximately 25% by primary depletion, an increase of approximately 600 MM STB of recoverable oil.

Above the bubble point, the reservoir is produced by liquid expansion, and there is a rapid decline in reservoir pressure that accompanies the recovery of a fraction of 1% to a few percentage points of the initial oil in place.

The gas-oil ratios remain low and generally near the value of the initial solution gas-oil ratio.

Below the bubble point, a gas phase develops that, in most cases, is immobile until the gas saturation reaches the critical gas saturation in the range of a few percentage points to 20%. During this period, the reservoir produces by gas expansion, which is characterized by a much slower decline in pressure and gas-oil ratios near or in some cases even below the initial solution gas-oil ratio. After.

Below the bubble point, a gas phase develops that, in most cases, is immobile until the gas saturation reaches the critical gas saturation in the range of a few percentage points to 20%. During this period, the reservoir produces by gas expansion, which is characterized by a much slower decline in pressure and gas-oil ratios near or in some cases even below the initial solution gas-oil ratio. After the critical gas saturation is reached, free gas begins to flow.

Many unsuccessful attempts were made to decrease the gas-oil ratios by shutting in the wells, by blanking off upper portions of the formation in producing wells, and by perforating only the lowest sand members.

The failure to reduce the gas-oil ratios is typical of the dissolved gas-drive mechanism, because when the critical gas saturation is reached, the gas-oil ratio is a function of the decline in reservoir pressure or depletion and is not materially changed by production rate or completion methods.

The initial gas-oil ratio of a properly completed well in either a dissolved gas drive, gas cap drive, or water-drive reservoir is usually a reliable value to use for the initial solution gas-oil ratio of the reservoir.

The term volumetric, however, is retained to indicate those reservoirs in which there is no water influx but in which volumes change slightly with pressure, due to the effects just mentioned.

Rp = Rsoi above the bubble point,.

As can be seen from the example calculations, the inclusion of the compressibility terms significantly affects the value of N. This is true above the bubble point where the oil-producing mechanism is depletion, or the swelling of reservoir fluids. After the bubble point is reached, the water and rock compressibilities have a much smaller effect on the calculations because the gas compressibility is so much greater.

When there is an initial gas cap (i.e., the oil is initially saturated), there is negligible liquid expansion energy.

(1) pronounced structure, (2) low oil viscosity, (3) high permeability, and (4) low oil velocities.

The most common source of water drive is a result of expansion of the water and the compressibility of the rock in the aquifer; however, it may result from artesian flow.

For heavy crudes whose dissolved gases are almost entirely methane and ethane, the manner of separation is relatively unimportant.

For lighter crudes and heavier gases (i.e., for reservoir fluids with larger fractions of the intermediate hydrocarbons—mainly propane, butanes, and pentanes), the manner of separation raises some important questions.

The flash liberation process, all the gas evolved during a reduction in pressure remains in contact and presumably in equilibrium with the liquid phase from which it is liberated.

The differential process, on the other hand, the gas evolved during a pressure reduction is removed from contact with the liquid phase as rapidly as it is liberated.

(1) the specific volume of the bubble-point oil, (2) the thermal expansion of the saturated oil, and (3) the compressibility of the reservoir fluid at or above the bubble point.

If all gas in reservoirs was methane and all oil was decane and heavier, the PVT properties of the reservoir fluids would be quite simple because the quantities of oil and gas obtained from a mixture of the two would be almost independent of the temperatures,.

The volatility is higher because of the higher reservoir temperatures at depth, approaching 500°F in some cases, and also because of the composition of the fluids, which are high in propane through decane.

The volatile oil reservoir is recognized as a type intermediate in volatility between the moderately volatile reservoir and the gas-condensate reservoir.

A typical laboratory method of estimating the recovery from volatile reservoirs is as follows. Samples of primary separator gas and liquid are obtained and analyzed for composition. With these compositions and a knowledge of separator gas and oil flow rates, the reservoir fluid composition can be calculated. Also, by recombining the separator fluids in the appropriate ratio, a reservoir fluid sample can be obtained. This reservoir fluid sample is placed in a PVT cell and brought to reservoir temperature and pressure. At this point, several tests are conducted. A constant composition expansion is performed to determine relative volume data. These data are the flash liberation volume data listed in Table 7.3. On a separate reservoir sample, a constant volume expansion is performed while the volumes and compositions of the produced phases are monitored. The produced phases are passed through a separator system that simulates the surface facilities. By expanding the original reservoir fluid from the initial reservoir pressure down to an abandonment pressure, the actual production process from the reservoir is simulated. Using the data from the laboratory expansion, the field production can be estimated with a procedure similar to the one used in Example 5.3 to predict performance from a gas-condensate reservoir.

Many studies indicate that the recovery from true solution gas-drive reservoirs by primary depletion is essentially in <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>.
