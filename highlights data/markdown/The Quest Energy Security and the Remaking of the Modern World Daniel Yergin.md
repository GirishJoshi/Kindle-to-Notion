Will enough energy be available to meet the needs of a growing world and at what cost and with what technologies? How can the security of the energy system on which the world depends be protected? What will be the impact of environmental concerns, including climate change, on the future of energy—and how will energy development affect the environment?.

What gave them a common definition was that they were based neither on fossil fuels nor on nuclear power.

The renewed uncertainty and insecurity about energy, and the anticipation of deeper crisis, underscored a fundamental reality—how important energy is to the world.

One of the nineteenth century’s greatest scientists, William Thomson—better known as Lord Kelvin—warned in 1881, in his presidential address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Edinburgh, that Britain’s energy base was precarious and that disaster was impending. His fear was not about oil, but about coal, which had generated the “Age of Steam,” fueled Britain’s industrial preeminance, and made the words of “Rule, Britannia!” a reality in world power. Kelvin somberly warned that Britain’s days of greatness might be numbered because “the subterranean coal-stores of the world” were “becoming exhausted surely, and not slowly” and the day was drawing close when “so little of it is left.” The only hope he could offer was “that windmills or wind-motors in some form will again be in the ascendant.”.

“Today, coal, oil and natural gas supply 93 percent of the world’s energy,” Rickover declared in 1957. That was, he said, a “startling reversal” from just a century earlier, in 1850, when “fossil fuels supplied 5 percent of the world’s energy, and men and animals 94 percent.” This harnessing of energy was what made possible a standard of living far higher than that of the mid-nineteenth century. But Rickover’s central point was that fossil fuels would run out sometime after 2000—and most likely before 2050.

There is one key energy source that most people do not think of as an energy source. Sometimes it is called conservation; sometimes efficiency. It is hard to conceptualize and hard to mobilize and yet it can make the biggest contribution of all to the energy balance in the years immediately ahead.

“Superpower,” he said, was “the word we used during the Cold War,” and the Cold War was over. “I have never referred to Russia as an energy superpower. But we do have greater possibilities than almost any other country in the world. If put together Russia’s energy potential in all areas, oil, gas, and nuclear, our country is unquestionably the leader.”.

It was Ludwig Nobel who conceived and built the world’s first oil tanker, to transport petroleum on the stormy Caspian Sea.

Shell Oil had been founded on the basis of oil from Baku, audaciously brought to world oil markets by an extraordinary entrepreneur and onetime shell merchant named Marcus Samuel.

With the collapse of the Russian Empire at the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution during World War I, the region west of the Caspian Sea, including Baku, declared itself the independent Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. It established one of the first modern parliaments in the Islamic world. It was also the first Muslim country to grant women the right to vote (ahead of such countries as Britain and the United States). But Lenin declared that his new revolutionary state could not survive without Baku’s oil, and in 1920 the Bolsheviks conquered the republic, incorporating it into the new Soviet Union and nationalizing the oil fields.

“Political activity revolved around the struggle to distribute the wealth, rather than the creation of a sustainable source of wealth that would depend upon the commercial initiatives and the productivity of the majority of the Venezuelan people.”.

The term describes an ailment that the Netherlands contracted in the 1960s. Around that time, the Netherlands was becoming a major natural gas exporter. As the new gas wealth flowed into the country, the rest of the Dutch economy suffered. The national currency became overvalued and exports became relatively more expensive—and, thus, declined. Domestic businesses became less competitive in the face of the rising tide of cheaper imports and increasingly embedded inflation. Jobs were lost and businesses couldn’t survive. All of this came to be known as Dutch disease.

There were many other ties as well. During the late 1970s, the Saudi cabinet was said to have more members with American Ph.D.s. than the U.S. cabinet.1.

President Bush laid out the fundamentals of the new policy in a speech at West Point in June 2002. Traditional “deterrence” did not work against “shadowy terrorist networks.” And “containment” did not work “when unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver these weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist allies.” The only answer was “preemptive action,” Bush added, “if we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long.”.

WHERE ARE THE PETROLEUM ENGINEERS?.

In November 2001 an economist at Goldman Sachs, Jim O’Neill, put out a research paper hatching a new concept: “the BRICs”—Brazil, Russia, India, and China. These four large-population economies, he said, were destined to grow faster than the main industrial economies. He made the startling prediction that within a few decades they would, as a group, overtake the combined GDP of the United States and the world’s five other largest economies.

A few days later, the head of one of the world’s largest state-owned energy companies declared that oil would hit $250 a barrel in the “foreseeable future.”.

On June 15, oil prices reached $139.89. The airline industry certainly had its back against the wall. In earlier years, fuel prices had been about 20 percent of operating costs; now they were up around 45 percent, bigger even than labor costs. Bankruptcies seemed inevitable—the only way out.19.

That includes the introduction of the digital oil field of the future. Sensors are deployed in all parts of the field, including in the wells. This dramatically improves the clarity and comprehensiveness of data and the communication between the field and a company’s technology centers, and allows operators to utilize more powerful computing resources to process incoming data. If widely adopted, the “digital oil field” could also make it possible to recover, worldwide, an enormous amount of additional oil—by one estimate, an extra 125 billion barrels of oil—almost equivalent to Iraq’s reserves.

New technologies are developed to identify new resources and to produce more from existing fields. For instance, in a typical oil field, only about 35 to 40 percent of the oil in place is produced using traditional methods. Much technology is being developed and applied to raising that recovery rate. That includes the introduction of the digital oil field of the future. Sensors are deployed in all parts of the field, including in the wells. This dramatically improves the clarity and comprehensiveness of data and the communication between the field and a company’s technology centers, and allows operators to utilize more powerful computing resources to process incoming data. If widely adopted, the “digital oil field” could also make it possible to recover, worldwide, an enormous amount of additional oil—by one estimate, an extra 125 billion barrels of oil—almost equivalent to Iraq’s reserves.

The argument focused on the supergiant Ghawar field, the largest oil field in the world.

“We used to joke all the time that much more oil was discovered by the petroleum engineers, developing and expanding the fields, than by us explorers, who actually found the fields.”.

What are the prospects for the future? One answer is drawn from an analysis using a database that includes 70,000 oil fields and 4.7 million individual wells, combined with existing production and 350 new projects. The conclusion is that the world is clearly not running out of oil. Far from it. The estimates for the world’s total stock of oil keep growing.

The world has produced about 1 trillion barrels of oil since the start of the industry in the nineteenth century. Currently, it is thought that there are at least 5 trillion barrels of petroleum resources, of which 1.4 trillion is sufficiently developed and technically and economically accessible to count as proved plus probable reserves. Based upon current and prospective plans, it appears the world liquid production capacity should grow from about 93 million barrels per day in 2010 to about 110 mbd by 2030. This is about a 20 percent increase.

These are the liquids that accompany the production of natural gas. Condensates are captured from gas when it comes out of the well. Natural gas liquids are separated out when the gas is processed for injection into a pipeline. Both are similar to high-quality light oils.

The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), along with the other IEA stocks, can be thought of as a giant insurance policy. Yet, often enough, when prices rise at the gasoline pumps, so do temptations and calls to “do something”—which means release oil from the SPR in order to bring prices down. That would have the effect of turning the reserve into a de facto tool for price controls. Tempting, for sure, but not the wisest policy.

Today Qatar has the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world and has become one of the main commercial hubs of the Persian Gulf.

After experimenting with a wide variety of possible sources—including hairs from the beards of two of his employees—he came up with a series of carbon filament, first made from cotton thread and then from cardboard and then bamboo, that passed the test.

Yet the superiority of alternating current was so clear that Westinghouse’s alternating current system prevailed. Westinghouse grabbed market share from Edison and established the foundations for large-scale generation. Edison’s technological stubbornness weakened his company financially during a time of business difficulties. His company, Edison General Electric—against his own fervent protestations—was forced into a merger with a competitor. To add to the ignominy and Edison’s pain, the merger stripped his name from the merged company. Thereafter, it would be known simply as General Electric.

Avoided costs were a very interesting concept: It was an estimate of how much the same amount of power would cost were it generated from an oil- or gas-fired facility. It was not an actual price, but an expected price sometime in the future.

The prospects for electric power in the twenty-first century can be summarized in a single word: growth.

India’s power consumption is expected to increase fivefold between 2010 and 2030.

The most prominent answer today is carbon capture and sequestration (or storage), better known by the shorthand CCS. To “sequester” something is to isolate it or set it apart; the concept here is to keep carbon out of the atmosphere by capturing it and burying it underground. “CCS is the critical future technology option for reducing CO2 emissions while keeping coal’s use above today’s level,” said the MIT study The Future of Coal. CO2 can be captured in several ways,.

CO2 can be captured in several ways, either before or after the coal is burned. One of the various methods, the only one that could likely be adapted to an existing coal plant, is capturing the CO2 after burning the coal. For the others it would be so expensive and complicated that it would be cheaper just to scrap the existing plant and build a new one.

To describe his vocation in his classic work, Voyages dans les Alpes, he invented the word “geology.” Saussure was fascinated by heat and altitude, and built devices to measure temperatures at the tops of mountains and the bottoms of lakes.4.

His wife had accidentally administered an overdose of sleep nostrum to relieve his intolerable insomnia. As he slipped away, he murmured, “My poor darling, you have killed your John.”8.

Revelle started off to be a geologist, but a fear of heights made him shy away from climbing up the sides of mountains, and he turned instead to the study of the depths of the oceans.

This was Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian economist and engineer who was accepting the award on behalf of the IPCC because he was its chairman. Pachauri coordinated a complex international network that involved the work of 450 lead authors, 2,500 scientific expert reviewers, and 800 contributing authors, representing altogether 113 countries—along with the representatives of those governments, all of whom had to acquiesce at least to the overall summary.

“India has not caused the problem of global warming. But try and make sure that India is part of the solution.”.

India’s traditional approach to international climate change negotiations was to reiterate even more strongly that it is a developing country with much poverty and that it and its economic growth should not be penalized for emissions that industrial countries have been putting into the atmosphere for over two centuries. Moreover, in the words of Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, it was the “kiss of death” for an Indian politician to be seen agreeing with the United States or the European Union on climate change policy. But as India becomes more integrated into the world economy, the perspective is changing. When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appointed Ramesh to the Environment ministry, he instructed him, “India has not caused the problem of global warming. But try and make sure that India is part of the solution.”.

One other technology needs to be added to the list: batteries for electric cars. These are not strictly renewable in the same way but fall within the same framework. They could count as renewable if the electricity by which they are recharged happens to be the product of wind or sunlight.

If Jimmy Carter was the energy pessimist, prophesying about the great dangers ahead and warning Americans to change their ways, Ronald Reagan was the opposite, the sunny optimist, the beacon of self-confidence, the proponent of a new “morning in America.”.

In the early 1970s, Kotaro Ikeguchi was a rising young official in MITI, Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Assigned to a department dealing with energy and mining, he became alarmed that Japan had become dangerously overreliant on Middle East oil and was oblivious to the risks. The consequences of a cutoff of supply could be disastrous. But Ikeguchi could not stir much interest. For Japan’s high-speed economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s had been fueled by Middle Eastern oil, and there was little expectation that would change. So as an outlet for his anxieties, Ikeguchi decided to write a novel that might wake up both officialdom and the public to Japan’s vulnerability. His imaginary crisis was a Middle Eastern war that resulted in a cutoff of imports. His hero? By coincidence, it was a spry, incisive, but very pragmatic MITI bureaucrat with an understanding of Japan’s precarious energy dependence. Since he was a working bureaucrat, he needed a pen name. He came up with “Taichi Sakaiya,” which means, loosely, “Big Man on the Roof of the World.” But before he could find a publisher, reality intruded. His fiction became nonfiction. With the 1973 oil crisis, the Japanese suddenly feared that their whole edifice of economic growth might collapse. Ikeguchi decided it would be inappropriate to publish his novel while the Japanese people were suffering through a real energy shortage, and he put it into a drawer.

Though largely forgotten, the major oil companies were early on among the main players in the development of photovoltaics in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Energy supports a sprawling R&D enterprise that extends from national laboratories like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to university scientists, private contractors, and companies. The DOE’s 17 national laboratories alone employ over 12,000 Ph.D. scientists full time, making it the largest employer of scientists in the world. Overall the DOE is also the “ministry of science” for the physical sciences, supporting almost half of all the physical sciences research in the United States, including over time the work of 111 Nobel Prize winners.

Challenges and the need for innovation. The total annual energy R&D spending in 2008 was equivalent to two weeks’ spending on the Iraq War.8.

Some like to say that venture capital—putting money into start-ups, betting on entrepreneurs and innovators—goes back much further. “Queen Isabella of Spain was one of the early venture capitalists when she backed Columbus,” said William Draper III, a veteran venture capitalist. She put her faith in a management team led by Christopher Columbus. “What she did was look into Columbus’s eyes and say that this guy might really sail off to some land and bring back some jewels.” J. P. Morgan’s funding of Thomas Edison’s electricity start-up in the 1870s and 1880s certainly qualifies as proto–venture capital.

He even delivered a lecture to what were then all-male classes on how to properly pick a wife.

Energy, at least energy production, is different in terms of time, money, and scale. “I see few similarities between the digital world and the energy world,” said Ray Lane. “There is no Moore’s Law. In fact, there are different laws like thermodynamics, physical relationships, chemical reactions, and biological systems. It is a policy-influenced, low-cost, mature, capital-intensive industry, which investors must understand. I recommend leaving.

Of course, a Google of energy may happen. It may even be happening right now but might not be recognized for five years. After all, how many people had heard of Google in 1998? But energy is different, very different. Google was helping to create a new industry—search—but not to take away market share from incumbent commodity suppliers, on which the entire economy depends.

Regulations. “And there’s no red ribbon to cut.” Conservation—energy efficiency—may be so obvious as a solution to cost and environmental issues. But there is no photo op, no opening ceremony where government officials and company executives can cut a ribbon, smile broadly into the camera, and inaugurate a grand new facility. He shook his head as he considered one of the most powerful of the life lessons he had learned from his deep immersion in global politics.

“It’s very important to be able to cut a red ribbon.”.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founder and former prime minister of modern Singapore, once described air-conditioning as “the most important invention of the twentieth century,” because, he explained, it enabled the people of the tropics to become productive. Singapore’s minister of the environment was a little more explicit, saying that, without air-conditioning, “instead of working in high-tech factories” Singapore’s workers “would probably be sitting under coconut trees.”6.

“I don’t think Nature would be so unkind as to withhold the secret of a good storage battery, if a real earnest hunt were made for it,”.

Natural gas would in effect become a motor fuel, but indirectly, by generating more of the electricity that ends up in the battery of an electric.

That is at the heart of the quest, it is as much about the human spirit as it is about technology, and that is why this is a quest that will never end.
