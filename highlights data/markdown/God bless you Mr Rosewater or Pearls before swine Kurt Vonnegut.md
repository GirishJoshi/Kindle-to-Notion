A sum of money is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a tale about bees.

All officers were officers for life, unless proved legally insane.

No member of the Rosewater Foundation could tell the Corporation what to do with the capital. Conversely, the Corporation was powerless to tell the Foundation what to do with the copious profits the Corporation made.

He had an enormous ass, which was luminous when bare.

Leonard Leech, once told him about getting ahead in law. Leech said that, just as a good airplane pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer be looking for situations where large amounts of money were about to change hands.

"In every big transaction," said Leech, "there is a magic moment during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is due to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient's blubbering thanks.".

Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day. And yet he could be thankful for the opportunity to pay a hundred thousand dollars or more for a painting by an Italian three centuries dead. And he capped this insult by giving paintings to museums for the spiritual elevation of the poor. The museums were closed on Sundays.

Lister has thought about the effects and implications of his inherited wealth about as much as most men think about their left big toes.

Dear Cousin or whoever you are. Be generous. Be kind. You can safely ignore the arts and sciences. They never helped anybody. Be a sincere, attentive friend of the poor.

The report contained Eliot's speech to the writers word-for-word. The meeting, including Eliot's drunken interruption, had been taken down on tape. "I love you sons of bitches," Eliot said in Milford. "You're all I read any more. You're the only ones who'll talk about the _really_ terrific changes going on, the only ones crazy enough to know that life is a space voyage, and not a short one, either, but one that'll last for billions of years. You're the only ones with guts enough to _really_ care about the future, who _really_ notice what machines do to us, what wars do to us, what cities do to us, what big, simple ideas do to us, what tremendous misunderstandings, mistakes, accidents and catastrophes do to us. You're the only ones zany enough to agonize over time and distances without limit, over mysteries that will never die, over the fact that we are right now determining whether the space voyage for the next billion years or so is going to be Heaven or Hell." * Eliot admitted later on that science-fiction writers couldn't write for sour apples, but he declared that it didn't matter. He said they were poets just the same, since they were more sensitive to important changes than anybody who was writing well. "The hell with the talented sparrowfarts who write delicately of one small piece of one mere lifetime, when the issues are galaxies, eons, and trillions of souls yet to be born.".

He didn't understand that what Trout had in common with pornography wasn't sex but fantasies of an impossibly hospitable world.

In Milford, Eliot told the writers that he wished they would learn more about sex and economics and style, but then he supposed that people dealing with really big issues didn't have much time for such things.

To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

Am I in favor of feeding labor crooks to lions? Well, to give those who get such satisfaction from imagining that I am covered with primordial scales a little twinge of pleasure, let me say, "Yes. Absolutely. This afternoon, if it can be arranged." To disappoint my critics, let me add that I am only fooling. I am not entertained by cruel and unusual punishments, not in the least.

He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer.

I do realize that I am a very slow realizer. I still find it hard to realize that I am an alcoholic, though even strangers know this right away.

"You know, I think the main purpose of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps is to get poor Americans into clean, pressed, unpatched clothes, so rich Americans can stand to look at them.".

I've gone sixteen hours without a drink! I don't miss the poison at all! Cheers!.

He often carries birth-control devices in his pocket, which many people find alarming and disgusting. The same people find it alarming and disgusting that the boy's father did _not_ use birth-control devices.

"I'm going to love these discarded Americans, even though they're useless and unattractive. _That_ is going to be my work of art.".

"_hysterical indifference to the troubles of those less fortunate than oneself_.".

Samaritrophia, _he read_, is the suppression of an overactive conscience by the rest of the mind.

"and she confessed to me that she spent the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth years of her life saying nothing but, 'No, thank you.' Which is all very well for a girl of that age and station. But it would have been a damned unattractive trait in a _male_ Rockefeller, and an even more unsuitable one, if I may say so, in a male Rosewater.".

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more." Eliot.

"Be that as it may, we _do_ now have a male Rosewater who says 'No' to all the good things life would like to give him. He won't even live in the mansion any more.".

It was stashed into a foundation in order that tax-collectors and other predators not named Rosewater might be prevented from getting their hands on it.

What engaged his emotions was the fact that the Rosewater fortune was the largest single money package represented by McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee. He recalled what his favorite professor,.

Mushari, who thought of himself as brave little David about to slay Goliath, was exactly half his age. And it was almost as though God Himself wanted little David to win, for confidential document after document proved that Eliot was crazy as a loon.

And Samuel bought newspapers, and preachers, too. He gave them this simple lesson to teach, and they taught it well: _Anybody who thought that the United States of America was supposed to be a Utopia was a piggy, lazy, God-damned fool_. Samuel thundered that no American factory hand was worth more than eighty cents a day. And yet he could be thankful for the opportunity to pay a hundred thousand dollars or more for a painting by an Italian three centuries dead. And he capped this insult by giving paintings to museums for the spiritual elevation of the poor. The museums were closed on Sundays.

Giving ninety-five per cent of it to the Foundation you now control didn't cause him a twinge.

The family visited the so-called "home" in Rosewater County very briefly every year, just long enough to reinvigorate the lie that it was home.

His duties, according to the charter, were exactly as flimsy or as formidable as he himself declared them to be.

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers --joined in the serious business of keeping our food, shelter, clothing and loved ones from combining with oxygen.

He drove away his rich friends by telling them that whatever they had was based on dumb luck. He advised his artist friends that the only people who paid any attention to what they did were rich horses' asses with nothing more athletic to do. He asked his scholarly friends, "Who has time to read all the boring crap you write and listen to all the boring things you say?" He alienated his friends in the sciences by thanking them extravagantly for scientific advances he had read about in recent newspapers and magazines, by assuring them, with a perfectly straight face, that life was getting better and better, thanks to scientific thinking.

Hamlet had one big edge on me. His father's ghost told him exactly what he had to do, while I am operating without instructions. But from somewhere something is trying to tell me where to go, what to do there, and why to do it. Don't worry, I don't hear voices. But there is this feeling that I have a destiny far away from the shallow and preposterous posing that is our life in New York. And I roam.

It was the one dash of reality added by Eliot's great-grandfather to a stock and bond fantasy of a canal that would join Chicago, Indianapolis, Rosewater and the Ohio.

Avondale as a constitutional monarch. They were employees of the Rosewater Corporation, and the properties they managed were owned by the Rosewater Foundation. Eliot could not tell them what to do --but he was surely the King, and Avondale knew it.

The therapist, after a deeply upsetting investigation of normality at this time and place, was bound to conclude that a normal person, functioning well on the upper levels of a prosperous, industrialized society, can hardly hear his conscience at all.

"Yes. If I don't make anything else clear tonight, at least let me make that clear: Eliot is right to do what he's doing. It's beautiful what he's doing. I'm simply not strong enough or good enough to be by his side any more. The fault is mine.".

"The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

Pained mystification, and then helplessness, suffused the Senator's face. "Tell me one good thing about those people Eliot helps." "I can't." "I thought not." "It's a secret thing," she said, forced to argue, pleading for the argument to stop right there. Without any notion of how merciless he was being, the Senator pressed on. "You're among friends now --suppose you tell us what this great secret is." "The secret is that they're human," said Sylvia. She looked from face to face for some flicker of understanding. There was none. The last face into which she peered was Norman Mushari's. Mushari gave her a hideously inappropriate smile of greed and fornication. Sylvia excused herself abruptly, went into the bathroom and wept.

"Sixty-eight years is a long time for a body to live without having one nice thing ever happen to the body. Nothing nice ever happened to me. How could it? I was behind the door when the good Lord passed out the brains.".

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If.

Eliot did to the word _love_ what the Russians did to the word _democracy_. If Eliot is going to love everybody, no matter what they are, no matter what they do, then those of us who love particular people for particular reasons had better find ourselves a new word.".

He looked up at an oil painting of his deceased wife. "For instance --I loved _her_ more than I loved our garbage collector, which makes me guilty of the most unspeakable of modern crimes: _Dis-crim-i-nay-tion_.".

"We don't piss in your ashtrays, So please don't throw cigarettes in our urinals.".

Stick your stainless steel spoon in this unhappy old man's brains, Doctor,' I told him, 'and stir.'.

Says, '_Don't Kill Yourself. Call the Rosewater Foundation_,' and it's got your number." Such stickers were in every phone booth in the county, and in the back windows of the cars and trucks of most of the volunteer firemen, too. "You know what somebody's written right under that in pencil?" "No.".

"The Government. If I'm not a Church, and I still want to keep people from killing themselves, I must be the Government. Right?".

"I'd ask you to name the rock-bottom price you'd charge to go on living for just one more week.".

Why do so many souls voluntarily return to Earth after failing and dying, failing and dying, failing and dying there? Because Heaven is such a null.

And those who read these lines of wit Should eat these little balls of shit.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

"Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes. I think it's terrible the way people don't share things in this country. I think it's a heartless government that will let one baby be born owning a big piece of the country, the way I was born, and let another baby be born without owning anything.

"We come to a supremely ironic moment in history, for Senator Rosewater of Indiana now asks his own son, 'Are you or have you ever been a communist?'" "Oh, I have what a lot of people would probably call communistic thoughts," said Eliot artlessly, "but, for heaven's sakes, Father, nobody can work with the poor and not fall over Karl Marx from time to time --or just fall over the Bible, as far as that goes.

I think it's a heartless government that will let one baby be born owning a big piece of the country, the way I was born, and let another baby be born without owning anything. The least a government could do, it seems to me, is to divide things up fairly among the babies. Life is hard enough, without people having to worry themselves sick about _money_, too. There's plenty for everybody in this country, if we'll only _share_.

"Sure --provided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there is a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and the powerful are,' I'd.

'Hello, babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. At the outside, babies, you've got about a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies --: "'God damn it, you've got to be kind.'".

He came out of the Pisquontuit Drug Store, squinted in the sunlight, took three deep breaths, went into the Pisquontuit News Store next door.

The lawyers and bankers felt somewhat cheated, since George didn't seem to be drawing any sort of moral from what should have been an important experience in almost any man's life. One lawyer, who had been looking forward to pointing out the moral when George got mad, couldn't restrain himself from pointing it out anyway, even though George was laughing: "People should always _read_ things before they sign them.".

It was on top of a jelly cupboard in the cellar of Fred's home. That was where he kept the rat poison, too.

The carpenter was worth twenty thousand dollars dead, thanks to Fred. He could think of little else but suicide whenever premium time rolled around.

"It comes when I have a bride come up to me and say, 'I don't know how the children and I can ever thank you enough for what you've done. God bless you, Mr. Rosewater.'".

"And your father didn't name us your guardians in his will because he thought we would agree politely with anything you might say.

"Every year at least one young man whose affairs we manage comes into our office, wants to give his money away. He has completed his first year at some great university. It has been an eventful year! He has learned of unbelievable suffering around the world. He has learned of the great crimes that are at the roots of so many family fortunes. He has had his Christian nose rubbed, often for the very first time, in the Sermon on the Mount. "He is confused, tearful, angry! He demands to know, in hollow tones, how much money he is worth. We tell him. He goes haggard with shame, even if his fortune is based on something as honest and useful as Scotch Tape, aspirin, rugged pants for the working man, or, as in your case, brooms. You have, if I'm not mistaken, just completed one year at Harvard?" "Yes." "It's a great institution, but, when I see the effect it has on certain young people, I ask myself, 'How dare a university teach compassion without teaching history, too?' History tells us this, my dear young Mr. Buntline, if it tells us nothing else: Giving away a fortune is a futile and destructive thing. It makes winners of the poor, without making them rich or even comfortable. And the donor and his descendents become undistinguished members of the whining poor.".

Your fortune is the most important single determinant of what you think of yourself and of what others think of you. Because of the money, you are extraordinary. Without it, for example, you would not now be taking the priceless time of a senior partner in McAllister, Robjent, Reed and McGee.

That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

Let me see you smile! Let me see that you already understand what they do not teach at Harvard until the junior year: That to be born rich and to stay rich is something less than a felony.".

"That's what I was _going_ to guess," said Caroline.

"People get what they deserve," said Amanita. "Isn't that right, Bunny?" "That's the First Law of Life," said Bunny Weeks.

There was never much doing in life insurance for poor people on warm afternoons.

The oath, which Selena had taken six hundred times, before six hundred very plain suppers, went like this, and was written by Castor Buntline, poor old Stewart's great-grandfather: I do solemnly swear that I will respect the sacred private property of others, and that I will be content with whatever station in life God Almighty may assign me to. I will be grateful to those who employ me, and will never complain about wages and hours, but will ask myself instead, "What more can I do for my employer, my republic, and my God?" I understand that I have not been placed on Earth to be happy. I am here to be tested. If I am to pass the test, I must be always unselfish, always sober, always truthful, always chaste in mind, body, and deed, and always respectful to those to whom God has, in His Wisdom, placed above me.

All right, we're poor! This is America! And America is one place in this sorry world where people shouldn't _have_ to apologize for being poor. The question in America should be, 'Is this guy a good citizen? Is he honest? Does he pull his own weight?'".

I've got the clap, and the blueballs, too. The clap don't hurt, but the blueballs do.

"I'm leaving," said Peach. "I know when I'm not wanted.".

"Kilgore Trout once wrote a whole book about a country that was devoted to fighting odors. That was the national purpose. There wasn't any disease, and there wasn't any crime, and there wasn't any war, so they went after odors.".

The Senator blew up. "Why do you _hate_ me so?" he cried. Eliot was flabbergasted. "Hate you? Father --I don't hate you. I don't hate anybody." "Your every act and word is aimed at hurting me as much as you possibly can!".

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use?.

The problem is this: How to love people who have no use? "In time, almost all men and women will become worthless as producers of goods, food, services, and more machines, as sources of practical ideas in the areas of economics, engineering, and probably medicine, too. So --if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are _human beings_, then we might as well, as has so often been suggested, rub them out.".

"There we have people treasuring people as people. It's extremely rare. So from this we must learn.".

"I just wish you'd stop saying you're a socialist. You're not! You're a free-enterpriser!".

"Keep away from booze, remember who you are, and behave accordingly," the Senator roundly declared. "And don't play God to people, or they will slobber all over you, take you for everything they can get, break commandments just for the fun of being forgiven --and revile you when you are gone.".

"It seems to me," said Trout, "that the main lesson Eliot learned is that people can use all the uncritical love they can get.".

"It's news that a man was able to _give_ that kind of love over a long period of time. If one man can do it, perhaps others can do it, too. It means that our hatred of useless human beings and the cruelties we inflict upon them for their own good need not be parts of human nature. Thanks to the example of Eliot Rosewater, millions upon millions of people may learn to love and help whomever they see.".

"Let their names be Rosewater from this moment on. And tell them that their father loves them, no matter what they may turn out to be. And tell them --" Eliot fell silent, raised his tennis racket as though it were a magic wand. "And tell them," he began again, "to be fruitful and multiply.".
