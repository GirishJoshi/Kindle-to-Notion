Vulnerability is the animating quality of all love stories, and it can take many forms.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery.

If I were Spock from Star Trek, I would explain that human love is a combination of three emotions or impulses: desire, vulnerability, and bravery. Desire makes one feel vulnerable, which then requires one to be brave.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery.

That’s love. Anyone can have it. All it requires is a little bravery. Or a lot.

“We get so fixated on the job we want or the person we’re dating because we don’t think there will be another. But there’s always another.”.

I traced it with my finger, from just below her armpit, over the speed bumps of her ribs, to her hip bone.

She had a boyfriend, so we couldn’t date, but we chatted online, learning about each other’s lives while we traded YouTube clips of our favorite Saturday Night Live sketches.

We sat so close I could smell her sweat, though the chemicals of infatuation turned it into a sweet perfume.

I secretly enjoy doing my taxes.

(Shocker: People’s feelings are never wrong.).

She thanked me for the flowers and didn’t even mention the letter. I knew then our relationship was over.

Because fixing something, especially when it’s a person, is what makes a man feel most valuable.

In the movies the romantic gesture works, but it failed me in real life. This was like Diane Court coming to the window only to shut it so she could go back to sleep. I gave her my heart; she thanked me for the $12.99 flowers.

“Happily ever after” is too boring for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

She was simply someone who had fallen out of love with her boyfriend. Which happens. It’s really uncinematic, but it happens.

I don’t very much like not being liked very much!”.

“I’d like to see how this experiment turns out,” I wrote in conclusion. “The question is, do you?”.

Even though I was riding in an ambulance to surgery, that one still stung.

We came up with an absurd screenplay idea, a horror movie set in a hospital.

I felt like a ghost returning to the scene of my own murder.

Sometimes when a guy really likes a girl, he gets a tattoo on his arm. I got this prominent scar instead. But there are times when I finger its deep groove (a new nervous tic), those six beautiful hours in the emergency room flicker in my head, and I am reminded how close I am to an alternate world in which I am happy, a world that occupies the same space as this one but is somehow distinct from it. And while that better world may be difficult to find, it is as close to me as the air in front of my face.

They didn’t say they craved attention but had trouble giving it to others. They didn’t say how cruel they could be.

Maybe he had seeds of doubt and realized what it takes a lot of other people years to figure out: that those seeds of doubt can spread tendrils through your body until they eventually strangle your heart.

There was only so much life to live, and no time to spend it with people who weren’t the very best fit.

This time our bonding was instantaneous and absolute, the kind shared between shipwreck survivors on a bobbing yellow life raft.

“These prickly little bastards is some tough hombres,” he explained. “Just like you and me. We may be in the desert right now, but I’m here to tell ya that we’ll get through this.”.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time:.

Pop music has the amazing ability to make you feel depressed and hopeful at the same time: depressed that you identify with the sentiment, and hopeful because someone feels more miserable than you.

Would they still be happy and smiling in a year’s time, knowing as we did that to love is to risk great unhappiness?.

Personal setbacks and romantic rejection, according to authorities ranging from the Dalai Lama to the editors of CosmoGirl, offer us all opportunities to behave with grace and courage and self-respect.

I wanted her back so bad it gave me a stomachache.

“She’s dead to me,” I told my friends. “I was mentally ill to have dated her,” I told my friends. “Obviously a borderline personality,” I told my friends. “Why did I throw away the best thing I ever had?” I wrote in my journal. “Please, God, bring her back.”.

I lost ten pounds in two weeks.

For some reason I’ve always been susceptible to thinking my life would be vastly improved by the solution to a single problem.

“Ghosting is the most cowardly way to end a relationship,” I once said to a male friend in a room with a guy who had ghosted me years before.

“I feel so lucky right now,” he said. “I can’t believe a girl like you would give me the time of day.”.

“But I don’t want a guy to be nice to me just because he feels obligated to, you know? I want him to be nice because he means it.”.

Some guys say they know immediately She’s the One. Not me. Whether it’s a sweater or software, it takes some time for me to know if I want to keep something, one reason I always save receipts. I can’t say there was an instance when I looked into the pale blue eyes of the girl I met over corned beef hash at a café in San Francisco and thought, This is it.

Now, after eight years, I know. When did I know? Was it how she helped me deal with the death of my grandfather? The relief I felt when she finally answered her cell on September 11? That great hike in Point Reyes? Because she cried when the Sox finally won? The way my nephew greets her like a rock star when she walks into the room? Perhaps I should have known right from the start, that morning of our cross-country trip, when she required one last trip to Arthur Bryant’s for a half slab of ribs for breakfast (and ten minutes into the meal saying to me, “Hey, baby, why don’t you pop open a beer?”). Or did I not truly know until seven years later when we found ourselves forced apart for more than a year? Who can say? It’s the big moments, maybe, but it’s the little moments as much or even more.

We had nothing to do but love each other and be happy.

The finish line was drawing closer. Why not have one last blossoming of the heart?.

Sam, I knew I was happy.

We followed our hearts and gambled, and for a few years we had a bit of heaven on earth.

Maybe love was just what people claimed to feel for anyone who’d put up with them.

That’s probably the beginning of love: when you see someone in a way that defies reality, but which makes perfect sense to you.

Reflected in the slump of her shoulders. I knew about despair. I wore it like a familiar coat, incapable of accepting what must be tolerated and petulantly ignoring what must be acknowledged. But at that moment—at the sight of such sadness in one usually so open and upbeat, sadness in the spirit of a woman who needed something from me—I wanted to offer more than mumbled words of apology. But I also knew that to push myself deeper into her world might carry us to a place where I might lose what I had made of myself, a place where I knew I could no longer hold tight to the hard reality that kept me sane.

“Where can I find a man silly enough to stay home with my boys when they have chicken pox?” she replied, smiling and lifting up to kiss the top of my head. “I like it that you put me first.”.

I chose to love Belinda, chose against my head-logic and with my heart-dreams.

Where once her husband was the center of her passionate universe, there is now a new sun in whose orbit she revolves.

If the most erotic form of foreplay to a mother of a small child is, as I’ve heard some women claim, loading the dishwasher or sweeping the floor, then he’s a master of titillation.

And afterward my husband will say that we, he and I, are the core of what he cherishes, that the children are satellites, beloved but tangential. He seems entirely unperturbed by loving me like this. Loving me more than his children does not bother him.

Loving me more than his children does not bother him. It does not make him feel like a bad father. He does not feel that loving me more than he loves them is a kind of infidelity.

I was thirty-three years old when we adopted DJ, and I thought I knew what a broken heart looked like, how it felt, but I didn’t know anything.

I was thirty-three years old when we adopted DJ, and I thought I knew what a broken heart looked like, how it felt, but I didn’t know anything. You know what a broken heart looks like? Like a sobbing teenager handing over a two-day-old infant she can’t take care of to a couple who she hopes can.

A lot of people who self-destruct don’t think twice about destroying their children in the process.

“The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.”.

When you’ve lived most of your adult life with someone else, you don’t know what you can and can’t do on your own anymore, what you can and can’t live without.
