“The present is the past rolled up for action, and the past is the present unrolled for understanding”.

Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law.

Co-operation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of competition; we co-operate in our group—our family, community, club, church, party, “race,” or nation—in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.

Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically, as in England and America in the nineteenth century under laissez-faire. To check the growth of inequality, liberty must be sacrificed, as in Russia after 1917. Even when repressed, inequality grows; only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed, and the best that the amiable philosopher can hope for is an approximate equality of legal justice and educational opportunity.

History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin.

Probably every vice was once a virtue—i.e.,.

In every age men have been dishonest and governments have been corrupt; probably less now than generally before.

“the men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.”.

In strict usage of the term, democracy has existed only in modern times,.

The American Revolution was not only a revolt of colonials against a distant government; it was also an uprising of a native middle class against an imported aristocracy.

Democracy is the most difficult of all forms of government, since it requires the widest spread of intelligence, and we forgot to make ourselves intelligent when we made ourselves sovereign. Education has spread, but intelligence is perpetually retarded by the fertility of the simple. A cynic remarked that “you mustn’t enthrone ignorance just because there is so much of it.” However, ignorance is not long enthroned, for it lends itself to manipulation by the forces that mold public opinion. It may be true, as Lincoln supposed, that “you can’t fool all the people all the time,” but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country.

In the last 3,421 years of recorded history only 268 have seen no war.

History repeats itself, but only in outline and in the large.
