Cost-reduction efforts have now brought the industry to a level of profitability that exceeds the level when oil prices peaked in 2014.

Royal Dutch Shell’s reported 2018 first quarter results show the company making as much profit at $60 per barrel as it did when oil was $100 per barrel.

Goldman Sachs also reported in early 2017 that European oil companies generated the same amount of cash at $52 per barrel as they did at $109.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest which was built almost completely on its oil and gas exports, intends to divest from holdings in fossil fuel businesses.

A new refinery, Canada’s first in a generation, rises from the industrial land northeast of Edmonton and will incorporate 25,000 sensors, an order of magnitude more than its predecessors. Each sensor will generate a steady flow of measurement data every second. The future of digital plants has arrived in oil and gas.

GasNinjas is in the fuel retail business and can even outsource the fuel delivery truck.

What’s fascinating about many of these business models is how they tend to be asset-light and information-intense, placing more value on data than on infrastructure.

What’s fascinating about many of these business models is how they tend to be asset-light and information-intense, placing more value on data than on infrastructure. Many in the world of commodities and heavy industry still believe pretty profoundly that asset ownership and ownership of all asset-related data is the key to economic success.

Take a look at Quick, Draw! by Google, which encourages people to doodle online while an artificial intelligence engine interprets the drawings and teaches itself to recognize real-world objects from the doodles.

Shell has spent many years developing SensaBot, a robot equipped with sensing technology, cameras, and arms to carry out maintenance, surveillance, and rescue operations undersea.

That’s why buyers issue purchase orders, shippers issue packing lists, sellers submit invoices, and banks provide deposit slips, all of which are supported by agreements,.

Privacy laws and confidential information rules are all linked to this question of trust.

In a meeting with me, the CIO of one of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies dismissed cloud computing as a rent-extracting monopoly to be avoided.

In a meeting with me, the CIO of one of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies dismissed cloud computing as a rent-extracting monopoly to be avoided. The industry has been wary of creating monopolistic dependencies in its business model. It likes to use multiple suppliers for any one service, prefers multiple pathways to market, and invests across multiple jurisdictions.

After all, the costs of construction are amortized over the life of the project, which may be forty years or longer—an extra dollar here and there doesn’t amount to much of a worry.

A large spend program (say, $10 billion for an LNG plant) could be amortized to the tune of $500 million per year, a pittance to a business that might generate $5 billion per year in cash flow.

How about brainwave sensors in hard hats to detect sleeplessness? Done. What about crowdsourced geology interpretation?.

For example, my former company prohibits collaboration tools that lack built-in encryption because of the sensitivity of company data.

On the one hand, if prices rise, I would rather have capital at the ready for growth. On the other hand, if prices stay flat or decline, I would rather work on getting operating costs permanently lowered.

There will be voices internally advocating a do-nothing stance to see either commodity prices turn around or clear winners and losers to emerge in the technology race. The default position for many oil and gas companies is to wait, let someone else take the lead, and aim to be a fast follower.

Oil and gas companies have squeezed their suppliers hard, but suppliers tell me that they have simply cut their prices while removing a bit of capacity from the market.

Only a handful of years ago, petroleum engineers were in such short supply that they could command some of the highest starting salaries straight out of college. Given what you know now, what would you suggest that a high school senior or university student consider when choosing courses to study or a career path? In a more digital world, for example, the kind of skills required in geology will change. Schools will need to incorporate more data science, more artificial intelligence, and more coding alongside studies of the Jurassic and the Devonian. These blended curricula will become the basis for success in the future.

The culture of oil and gas places strong emphasis on safety, reliability, operational excellence, and environmental sensitivity. Another term for this culture is risk averse.

A junior field engineer with an EPC firm was tasked with visiting a company’s gas assets and building up an inventory of what was installed. Rather than using the typical paper diagrams and clipboards, he purchased a tablet and downloaded a free app from iTunes that normally would be used to build a home inventory for insurance purposes. He replaced the list of home assets (such as stereo system and microwave oven) with gas assets (such as wellhead, flare, and separator). With a couple of junior colleagues, he then set out to build the inventory. The team photographed the assets, built the inventory, and completed their work in a fraction of the time. The data captured was so accurate and complete that there was no data-entry work for the home-office team. Meanwhile, he encountered heated resistance to his novel approach the entire time—tablets won’t work in the field, the junior engineers won’t complete the inventory properly, the free app won’t be robust enough, the data collected won’t be in a format acceptable to the document controllers, and on and on.

One vendor of artificial intelligence tools told me that the biggest hurdle they encounter is convincing a grizzly veteran who’s spent thirty years managing an asset that AI can better his performance at all, let alone by 10 percent or more.

The first change challenge to manage is the temptation to view digital innovation as the end, not the means to the end.

“People follow process using data enabled by technology.”.

New mandate made it illegal for a government department to ask its citizens for the same information twice.

The world’s most aggressive digital country by far is Estonia. A new mandate made it illegal for a government department to ask its citizens for the same information twice. The country had to agree on a national data architecture to achieve this goal. It attracts more virtual citizens than any other in Europe. Boards might wish to hold a meeting there and see about meetings with the country’s CIO to understand how it is transitioning to a digital future. Estonia’s insights will fundamentally challenge many Western orthodoxies about commerce, governance, accountability, and business models.

Other industries have abandoned traditional ideas about what is core to their business and what can be more profitably sourced. Digital.

Business-model changes seemingly come from nowhere to catch industry incumbents off-guard. For example, Kodak had its eye on digital cameras, but the real threat came from camera phones. Paper maps have all but disappeared with the development of GPS. The Yellow Pages were not searching for search engines. The DVD industry was worried more about LaserDiscs than video streaming.

Recall that one company’s margin is another company’s meal:.

Refining and chemicals, where IP and value lies in owning the “recipe,” not necessarily the assets of production;.

Some Australian offshore gas projects paid north of $200,000 per year for “laundry technicians.”.

The idea that only a human can take a seat, read the dials, handle the controls, and act is fast becoming an obsolete idea.

I began to piece the story together, like a quilter who takes fragments of leftover cloth and builds a tapestry (it looks good from a distance, but up close it’s pretty ugly).

Skeptics, and there are many, view digital at one end of a spectrum as a solution looking for a problem and, at the other end, as another play by technology companies to get rich at their customers’ expense.

I used to joke that a fifty-five-year-old with thirty years of experience actually had just one year of experience repeated thirty times.
