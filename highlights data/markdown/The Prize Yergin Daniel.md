On August 2, 1990, yet another of the century’s dictators, Saddam Hussein of Iraq, invaded the neighboring country of Kuwait. His goal was not only conquest of a sovereign state, but also the capture of its riches. The prize was enormous. If successful, Iraq would have become the world’s leading oil power, and it would have dominated both the Arab world and the Persian Gulf, where the bulk of the planet’s oil reserves is concentrated. Its new strength and wealth and control of oil would have forced the rest of the world to pay court to the ambitions of Saddam Hussein. The result would have been a dramatic shift in the international balance of power. In short, mastery itself was once more the prize.

Gasoline was then only an almost useless by-product, which sometimes managed to be sold for as much as two cents a gallon, and, when it could not be sold at all, was run out into rivers at night. But just as the invention of the incandescent light bulb seemed to signal the obsolescence of the oil industry, a new era opened with the development of the internal combustion engine powered by gasoline. The oil industry had a new market, and a new civilization was born.

It is oil that makes possible where we live, how we live, how we commute to work, how we travel—even where we conduct our courtships. It is the lifeblood of suburban communities. Oil (and natural gas) are the essential components in the fertilizer on which world agriculture depends; oil makes it possible to transport food to the totally non-self-sufficient megacities of the world. Oil also provides the plastics and chemicals that are the bricks and mortar of contemporary civilization, a civilization that would collapse if the world’s oil wells suddenly went dry.

Silliman banished any doubts about the potential new uses for rock oil. He reported to his clients that it could be brought to various levels of boiling and thus distilled into several fractions, all composed of carbon and hydrogen. One of these fractions was a very high-quality illuminating oil. “Gentlemen,” Silliman wrote to his clients, “it appears to me that there is much ground for encouragement in the belief that your Company have in their possession a raw material from which, by simple and not expensive processes, they may manufacture very valuable products.” And, satisfied with the business relationship as it had finally been resolved, he held himself fully available to take on further projects.

They got hold of every whiskey barrel they could scrounge in the area, and when all the barrels were filled, they built and filled several wooden vats. Unfortunately, one night the flame from a lantern ignited the petroleum gases, causing the entire storage area to explode and go up in fierce flames. Meanwhile, other wells were drilled in the neighborhood, and more rock oil became available. Supply far outran demand, and the price plummeted. With the advent of drilling, there was no shortage of rock oil. The only shortage now was of whiskey barrels, and they soon cost almost twice as much as the oil inside them.7.

The drive for “flush production” often damaged the reservoirs, leading to premature exhaustion of gas pressure, and thus far less recovery than would otherwise have been the case.

Between 1863 and 1865, de-spite much scoffing and public ridicule, wooden pipelines proved that they could carry oil much more efficiently and cheaply. The teamsters, seeing their position challenged, responded with threats, armed attacks, arson, and sabotage. But it was too late. By 1866, pipelines were hooked up to most of the wells in the Oil Regions, feeding into a larger pipeline gathering system that connected with the railroads.

Oil was bought and sold on three bases. “Spot” sales called for immediate delivery and payment. A “regular” sale required the transaction to be completed within ten days. And the sale of “futures” established that a certain quantity would be sold at a certain price within a specified time in the future. The futures prices were the focus for speculation, and oil became “the favorite speculative commodity of the time.” The buyer was bound either to take the oil and pay the contracted price—or to pay or receive the difference between the contracted price and the “regular” price at the time of settlement. Thus, buyers could make a handsome profit—or suffer a devastating loss—without even taking possession of the oil.

The son’s character was already set at a young age—pious, single-minded, persistent, thorough, attentive to detail, with both a gift and a fascination for numbers, especially numbers that involved money. At the age of seven, he launched his first successful venture—selling turkeys. His father sought to teach him and his brothers mercantile skills early. “I trade with the boys,” the father was reported to have boasted, “and skin ’em and I just beat ’em every time I can. I want to make ’em sharp.” Mathematics was the young Rockefeller’s best subject in high school. The school stressed mental arithmetic—the ability to do calculations quickly in one’s head—and he excelled at it.

In 1867, Rockefeller was joined by a young man, Henry Flagler, whose influence in the creation of Standard Oil was almost as great as Rockefeller’s.

At the end of the 1880s, he committed himself to the creation of a great Baptist university, and, in that cause, he provided the endowment, as well as the organizational focus, for the establishment of the University of Chicago. He continued to be by far its largest donor. Though he paid keen attention to its development, he did not interfere in its academic workings, save to insist that it stay within its budget. He refused to allow any buildings to be named after him so long as he was alive, and visited the university only twice in its first ten years. The initial visit was in 1896, on its fifth anniversary. “I believe in the work,” he told a university convocation. “It is the best investment I ever made in my life.

By 1910, the “spare change” that Rockefeller had given to the university added up to $35 million, compared to $7 million from all other sources. And, altogether, to all his causes, he was to give away some $550 million. He carried over his habits of business.

The prolific Baku fields continued to throw up new petroleum fountains and ever more oil. But there had been one dramatic change in the Russian oil industry. While Ludwig Nobel’s patience and determination did not abate in the face of the never-ending obstacles, physically he was worn out. In 1888 at the age of fifty-seven, the Oil King of Baku died of a heart attack while vacationing on the French Riviera. Some of the European newspapers confused the Nobel brothers and instead reported the death of Alfred. Reading his own premature obituaries, Alfred was distressed to find himself condemned as a munitions maker, the “dynamite king,” a merchant of death who had made a huge fortune by finding new ways to maim and kill. He brooded over these obituaries and their condemnations, and eventually rewrote his will, leaving his money for the establishment of the prizes that would perpetuate his name in a way that would seem to honor the best in human endeavor.6.

Marcus Samuel was always the trader, the idea man, and Samuel Samuel, two years younger, always the loyal adherent and sidekick.

Marcus was the more complicated, and as the years went by, his considerable charm gave way to a remoteness that almost seemed to be a mask. Short and stout, with heavy eyebrows, he was totally unprepossessing in appearance. But he was capable of bold vision, and he was adventurous, ingenious, quick to act, and single-minded when he chose to be. He talked in a very soft voice, sometimes hardly audible, making people strain to hear him and perhaps making himself all the more persuasive. He also instilled trust in people, so much so that for two decades, he depended for his credit not on bankers but on those Scottish merchants in the Far East. Marcus had more on his agenda than simply accumulating wealth for its own sake. He had a craving for position. As an outsider, as a Jew born in the East End of London, he would put his considerable energies into seeking and winning acceptance for the name Samuel at the highest levels of British society.

The construction workers were forced to brave armed attacks from railway men, as well as steam, hot water, and hot coals poured over them from locomotives. Such may have been the “gloved hand” of Standard Oil at work. Nevertheless, the pipeline got built.

Lucas and Higgins made a deal, and the captain commenced drilling in 1899. His first efforts failed. More professional geologists ridiculed the concept. They told him that he was wasting his time and money. There was no chance that a salt dome could mean oil. Captain Lucas could not convince them otherwise. He was discouraged by the professionals’ rejection of what he called his “visions,” and his confidence was shaken. He ran out of money, and he needed new funds if he was to continue. He won a hearing from Standard Oil, but was turned away empty-handed.

Lucas 1 on Spindletop, as the well became known, was flowing not at fifty barrels per day, but at as much as seventy-five thousand barrels per day. The roar could be heard clearly in Beaumont; some people thought it was the end of the world. It was something never seen before anywhere—except in the “oil fountains” of Baku. The.

In 1892, in response to a court decision in Ohio, the trust was dissolved and the shares were transferred to twenty companies. But control remained with the same owners. The companies were grouped together as the “Standard Oil Interests.” Under this new arrangement, the Executive Committee at 26 Broadway gave way to an informal meeting of presidents of the various constituent firms that constituted the Standard Oil Interests. Letters were no longer addressed to the Executive Committee, but rather simply to the “gentlemen upstairs.”.

The company transported more than four-fifths of all oil produced in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. It refined more than three-fourths of all United States crude oil; it owned more than half of all tank cars; it marketed more than four-fifths of all domestic kerosene and was responsible for more than four-fifths of all kerosene exported; it sold to the railroads more than nine-tenths of all their lubricating oils. It also sold a vast array of by-products—including 300 million candles of seven hundred different types. It even deployed its own navy—seventy-eight steamers and nineteen sailing vessels. How was all this to be dismembered?.

Royal Dutch desperately tried to find new production. No fewer than 110 times did it drill for oil in Sumatra, and no fewer than 110 times did it fail to find new oil.

“I am at present in a generous mood. I have made you this offer, but if you leave this room without accepting it, the offer is off.”.

Samuel treated himself to a 650-ton yacht to assuage his hurt and took himself to sea.

John Arbuthnot Fisher, who would be memorialized by Marcus Samuel as “the God-father of oil,” became First Sea Lord in 1904. For the next six years,.

‘He’s a good teapot though he may be a bad pourer’!”.

“mastery itself was the prize of the venture.”.

“we should be able to raise the whole power and efficiency of the Navy to a definitely higher level; better ships, better crews, higher economies, more intense forms of war power”—in.

At last, Marcus Samuel’s dream of an oil-fueled British Navy looked to become a reality. But one question remained: who would reap the profits? The likely choices were only two: the powerful and entrenched Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and the much smaller and still-struggling Anglo-Persian Oil Company.10.

Fidgety and aggravated as Churchill spoke.15 “This afternoon we have to deal, not with the policy of building oil-driven ships or of using oil as an ancillary fuel in coal-driven ships,”.

“This afternoon we have to deal, not with the policy of building oil-driven ships or of using oil as an ancillary fuel in coal-driven ships,” Churchill began, “but with the consequence of that policy.”.

“Look out upon the wide expanse of the oil regions of the world. Two gigantic corporations—one in either hemisphere—stand out predominantly. In the New World there is the Standard Oil. … In the Old World the great combination of the Shell and the Royal Dutch, with all their subsidiary and ancillary branches, has practically covered the whole ground, even reached out into the New World.”.

“a long steady squeeze by the oil trusts all over the world.”.

“He had better hear the case for the prosecution,” Churchill acidly said after the third interruption, “before he offers an argument for the defense.”.

Samuel resumed his seat but not his composure.

“For many years,” Churchill went on, “it has been the policy of the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Indian Government to preserve the independent British oil interests of the Persian oil-field, to help that field to develop as well as we could and, above all, to prevent it being swallowed up by the Shell or by any foreign or cosmopolitan companies.”.

“over the whole of these enormous regions we obtain the power to regulate developments according to naval and national interest.” Declaring that “all the criticisms” of such a plan “so far, have flowed from one fountain,” Churchill then launched an attack on that fountain—Royal Dutch/Shell and Marcus Samuel—though adding, “I do not wish to make any attack upon the Shell or the Royal Dutch Company.” “Not the least!” Samuel Samuel called out from the back bench. Churchill’s oratory was full of sarcasm. Were the bill to fail, he said, Anglo-Persian would become part of Shell. “We have no quarrel with the ‘Shell.’ We have always found them courteous, considerate, ready to oblige, anxious to serve the Admiralty, and to promote the interests of the British Navy and the British Empire—at a price. The only difficulty has been price.” With the leverage of Persian oil “at our disposal, we do not think we shall be treated with less courtesy, or less consideration, or shall we find these gentlemen less obliging, less public spirited, or less patriotic than before. On the contrary, if that slight difference of opinion which has hitherto existed about prices—I am obliged to return to that vicious and sordid matter of prices—were removed, our relations would be better; they would become … the sweeter, because no longer leavened with the sense of injustice.”.

Churchill’s proposal for government ownership of a private company was indeed unprecedented,.

“How did you manage to carry the House with you so successfully?” “It was,” Churchill replied, the “attack on monopolies and trusts that did it.”16.

Here, in the matter of Deterding, Churchill was following Admiral Fisher’s lead. Fisher wrote to Churchill that Deterding, “is Napoleon and Cromwell rolled into one. He is the greatest man I ever met … Napoleonic in his audacity: Cromwellian in his thoroughness! … Placate him, don’t threaten him! Make a contract with him for his fleet of 64 oil tankers in case of war. Don’t abuse the Shell Company. … [Deterding] has a son at Rugby or Eton and has bought a big property in Norfolk and [is] building a castle! Bind him to the land of his adoption!”.

Many reasons were proffered—from blunder, arrogance, and stupidity to the accumulated tensions of international rivalries and industrial society. The reasons also encompassed the secular religion of nationalism; the sclerosis of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Turkish empires; the collapse of the traditional balance of power; and the ambitions.

The reliance on horses greatly complicated the problems of supply, for each horse required ten times as much food as each man.

Yet what was needed was not necessarily wanted.

Taken up and championed by Winston Churchill.

And, in the face of the Army’s resistance, Churchill doled out Navy funds for the continuing research needed to develop the new vehicle.

Reflecting the Navy’s temporary sponsorship, the new machine was known as the “land cruiser” or the “landship.” Churchill called it the “caterpillar.” To maintain secrecy, it needed a code name while it was being tested and transported, and various names—among others, the “cistern” and the “reservoir”—were considered. But finally it became known by another of its code names—the “tank.”.

Samuel and his colleagues conceived a daring plan, which was swiftly put into effect. In the middle of the night at the end of January 1915, the plant in Rotterdam was disassembled, part by part, each piece numbered and camouflaged, and then carried to the docks and loaded onto a Dutch freighter, which slipped out into the darkness to rendezvous at sea with British destroyers. A cover story was leaked to German agents that such an evacuation was to take place—but that it would occur a day later than the actual event. That following night, whether by coincidence or not, a similar Dutch freighter was torpedoed by the Germans at the mouth of Rotterdam’s harbor. The parts of the toluol plant, meanwhile, were transported to Britain, and were re-erected in Somerset within weeks. That plant, along with a second one that Shell subsequently built, provided 80 percent of the British military’s TNT. It was for this achievement, in large part, that Samuel was awarded a peerage after the war.

“You may have men, munitions, and money, but if you do not have oil, which is today the greatest motive power that you use, all your other advantages would be of comparatively little value.”.

Britain wanted to assert its influence over what was loosely known as Mesopotamia, the provinces of the now defunct Turkish Ottoman Empire that would later be known as Iraq.

“The hand you dare not bite, kiss it.”.

The issue became more urgent in 1917 when British forces captured Baghdad.

“The world,” he would soon write to the president of Standard Oil, was “suffering from over-production, over-refining, over-transporting, and—last but not least—over-retailing.”.

The fear of shortage was such that one Senator called on the U.S. Navy to reconvert from oil back to coal.

In Britain, where similar shortfalls were anticipated, Anglo-Persian was doing research on extracting liquid fuels from coal, and the British government had given over two acres in Dorset to the cultivation of Jerusalem artichokes in the hope that this plant could produce alcohol in commercial quantities to be used as automobile fuel.

At Cornell University, Teagle seemed to be manager or organizer of almost every student activity. He wrote his undergraduate thesis on the desulfurization of crude oil and scored an unheard-of perfect one hundred in industrial chemistry. Like Gulbenkian, he was encouraged by his professor to study for an advanced degree, and his father responded as sharply as Gulbenkian’s had—in Teagle’s case, with a terse telegram, “Come home at once.”.

“He’d trade and trade and trade. If it was company money, he’d think he was paying too much for a five cent cigar and try to get it for four.”.

It was certainly a great victory for Gulbenkian—the culmination of thirty-seven years of concentration, and a testament to his perseverance and tenacity.

As for kerosene, its production and consumption were negligible by comparison. The “new light” had given way to the “new fuel.”2.

“My friends, it is the juice of the fountain of eternal youth that you are selling. It is health. It is comfort. It is success.

They were searching for a solution to the dilemmas of overproduction and over-capacity in their troubled industry.

At the juncture of these various interests stood Sir John Cadman, the successor to Charles Greenway as chairman of Anglo-Persian. By 1928, Cadman was arriving at the peak of his influence, operating on the same plane as Deterding and Teagle, but also with unparalleled credibility in the eyes of the British government. Growing up in a family of mining engineers, Cadman had begun his own career as a coal mine manager. (He won awards for saving miners during underground disasters.) In time, he became professor of mining at Birmingham University, where he had shocked the academic establishment by introducing a new course in “petroleum engineering,” so novel that an academic opponent denounced it as “flagrantly advertised” and “a blind alley” with “a freak title.” By the outbreak of World War I, Cadman was one of the outstanding experts on oil technology. During the war, as head of the Petroleum Executive, he demonstrated considerable skills both at politics and in managing people. In 1921, he became technical adviser to Anglo-Persian; six years later, the government’s candidate, he became its chairman.

Governments imposed import quotas, set prices, and placed restrictions on foreign exchange. They forced companies to blend alcohol made from surplus crops into motor fuel, and to use other petroleum substitutes. They levied a multitude of new taxes and intervened to control the direction of the export and import trade in oil to match bilateral trade agreements and larger political links. They blocked profit remittances, forcing investment in domestic facilities that lacked economic justification, and insisted that companies maintain extra inventories.

“We are now confronted with nationalistic policies in almost all foreign countries, as well as decidedly socialistic tendencies in many,”.

Operations in the oil business in Europe, he said, “are 90 percent political and 10 percent oil.” The same seemed to be true in the rest of the world.

The company, to be sure, was convinced that there was no oil to be found in Arabia.

“we shall be guilty of an unpardonable crime against our race.”.

The fishing fleet, which was one of the main sources of Japan’s food, was ordered to give up oil and instead to depend exclusively upon wind power!.

At a fundamental level, each side had underestimated the other. Just as the Japanese did not think the Americans were technically capable of cracking their most secret codes, so the Americans could not conceive that the Japanese would be able to mount so technically complex an operation.

All of the oil world is divided into three. The “upstream” comprises exploration and production. The “midstream” are the tankers and pipelines that carry crude oil to refineries. The “downstream” includes refining, marketing, and distribution, right down to the corner gasoline station or convenience store. A company that includes together significant upstream and downstream activities is said to be “integrated.”.

By 1940, synthetic fuel output had increased drastically—72,000 barrels per day, accounting for 46 percent of total oil supply.

“The bravest men can do nothing without guns, the guns nothing without plenty of ammunition, and neither guns nor ammunition are of much use in mobile warfare unless there are vehicles with sufficient petrol to haul them around.”.

“The synthetic fuel industry in Japan, in terms of its absorption of materials and manpower and its meager product, was more of a liability than an asset during the war.”.

But the Americans had put together a devastating package—amphibious warfare, carrier air power, and industrial might. The Japanese could not match this enormous expenditure of resources.

It was out of desperation in this battle that the Japanese explicitly introduced a new weapon—the suicide pilots called kamikazes. The word meant “divine wind,” after a typhoon in the thirteenth century that had shattered the great invasion fleet of Kublai Khan before it could land in Japan. These suicide pilots, who were ordered to crash their planes (including specially designed manned rocket bombs) onto the decks of the American ships, were meant to be the ultimate embodiment of the Japanese spirit, inspiring all their compatriots to total sacrifice.

If he crashed his plane, not only would his commitment and willingness to die unnerve an enemy who could not comprehend the mentality of such an act, but—since he was not going to return—his fuel requirement was cut in half.8 The End of the Imperial.

Stalin had promised Roosevelt and Churchill to bring the Soviet Union into the war against Japan some ninety days after the end of the war in Europe.

Russia had suffered at the hands of the Japanese in 1905.

The first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and sent its troops pouring into Manchuria, a week earlier than had been planned, in order to ensure that the war did not end before it could get in. On August 9, the second atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki. Yet even as late as the Nagasaki explosion, the Army Chief of Staff insisted on reminding senior officials that Japanese soldiers and sailors were not permitted to surrender under any circumstances; suicide was the only acceptable way out.

One of the biggest technical disappointments of the war was PLUTO—the acronym for “Pipeline Under the Ocean.” This underwater pipeline system was designed to link the British side of the English Channel to the French.

Everlasting reputation. That was only the beginning. DeGolyer was more responsible than any other single person for the introduction of geophysics into oil exploration. He pioneered the development of the seismograph, one of the most important innovations in the.

DeGolyer was more responsible than any other single person for the introduction of geophysics into oil exploration.

He was a founder of what became Texas Instruments.

When he came back to Washington in early 1944, DeGolyer reported that the proven and probable reserves of the region—Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar—amounted to about 25 billion barrels. Of that, Saudi Arabia accounted for about 20 percent—perhaps 5 billion barrels. He was a conservative man, and he applied the same standards for “proven” and “probable” reserves on behalf of the United States government as he would have in appraising the reserves for a bank. In fact, he suspected that the reserves would be much, much larger. And, indeed, estimates that sounded like lunacy—up to 300 billion barrels for the region and 100 billion barrels for Saudi Arabia alone—resulted from his trip. One of the members of his mission told officials in the State Department, “The oil in this region is the greatest single prize in all history.”.

At one point, the King declared that he was the “twin” brother of the President because of their close ages, their responsibilities for their nations’ well-being, their interests in farming, and their grave physical infirmities—the President confined by polio to a wheelchair, and the King walking with difficulty and unable to climb stairs because of war wounds in his legs. “You are luckier than I because you can still walk on your legs and I have to be wheeled wherever I go,” said Roosevelt. “No, my friend, you are more fortunate,” the King replied. “Your chair will take you wherever you want to go and you know you will get there. My legs are less reliable and are getting weaker every day.” “If you think so highly of this chair,” said Roosevelt “I will give you the twin of this chair, as I have two on board.”.

“The immense oil deposits in Saudi Arabia alone make that country more important to American diplomacy than almost any other smaller nation.”.

Its imperial role had become an insupportable burden. During those few bleak, freezing, and pivotal weeks of February 1947, the Labour government of Clement Attlee referred its intractable Palestine problem to the United Nations and announced that it would grant independence to India. And on February 21 it told the United States that it could no longer afford to prop up the Greek economy. It asked that the United States take over that responsibility and, by implication, broader responsibilities throughout the Near and Middle East.

Another obstacle was the stubbornness of the countries the pipeline had to cross, particularly Syria, all of which were demanding what seemed to be exorbitant transit fees. It was also the time when the partition of Palestine and the establishment of the state of Israel were aggravating American relations with the Arab countries. But the emergence of a Jewish state, along with the American recognition that followed, threatened more than transit rights for the pipeline.

They both sell their grain at the same price. But the costs of the one with the more fertile fields are much less than those of the one with the less fertile fields.

Generation to Adam Smith. Ricardo developed the concept that was to provide the framework for the battle between nation-states and oil companies. It was the notion of “rents” as something different from normal profits. His case study involved grain, but it could also apply to oil. Let there be two landlords, said Ricardo, one with fields much more fertile than the other. They both sell their grain at the same price. But the costs of the one with the more fertile fields are much less than those of the one with the less fertile fields.

Unfortunately, “‘fairness’ and ‘unfairness’ are essentially concepts of the emotions rather than fixed and measurable standards.” However disconcerting and unpalatable it might be to the engineers, businessmen, and buccaneers who ran international oil companies, that was a fact of life. “Experience already shows that there is something inherently satisfying in the ‘50/50’ concept.”.

Another deputy thundered that it would be better for the Iranian oil industry to be destroyed by an atomic bomb than remain in the hands of Anglo-Iranian.

Prime Minister Razmara did not know what to do. Finally, in a speech to Parliament in March 1951, he came out against nationalization.

The Organization for European Economic Cooperation (subsequently the OECD) created a Petroleum Emergency Group, which actually made the allocations, based on a formula that reflected pre-Suez oil use, stock levels, and local energy supplies.

“He was the last prime minister to believe Britain was a great power and the first to confront a crisis which proved she was not.”.

The Suez crisis gave the international oil industry considerable food for thought. Despite the return to operation of the canal, the oil companies were no longer confident that they could rely on it. A great deal of discussion followed among companies and governments about building more pipelines.

He offered a special prayer for the British people—that they might discover “a lake of oil” under the North Sea. That was exactly what they were just beginning to do in 1970, though they would not be able to benefit from it in time to prevent Edward Heath from being toppled by another energy crisis.

The leading petroleum engineers of the day, was just finishing a secret study for the Saudi Arabian government of its reserves.

Proven world oil reserves in the noncommunist world increased from 62 billion barrels in 1948 to 534 billion barrels in 1972, almost a ninefold rise.

American reserves had grown from 21 billion barrels in 1948 to 38 billion barrels by 1972. But their statistical significance had shrunk, from 34 percent of total world reserves to a mere 7 percent.

What these enormous numbers meant was that, as fast as the world was using oil, it was even more quickly adding new reserves.

In 1950, the industry estimated that, with current proven reserves at current rates of production, the world had enough oil to last nineteen years.

By 1972, after all the years of rapid growth, of the intoxicating increase in consumption and the pell-mell pace of production, the estimated reserve life was thirty-five years.

The postwar petroleum order rested on two foundations. One was composed of the great oil deals of the 1940s, which had established the basic relationships among companies operating in the Middle East. These arrangements mobilized the resources required for the rapid development of the petroleum reserves, tied production to the refining and marketing systems required by the scale of reserves, and developed and secured the much larger demand that was required. The second foundation was composed of the concessional and contractual relationships between the companies and the governments of the oil-producing countries, at the heart of which was the hard-won fifty-fifty profit-sharing arrangement. On those two bases, it was hoped, relative stability would be built.

In the changing dynamics of the petroleum industry. It marked the first real steps toward creating a common front against the oil companies. As for Wanda Jablonski, she was as usual near the center of the action; she had just been the matchmaker for an alliance that would develop into the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries—OPEC.19.

At one point, Russian oil could be picked up in Black Sea ports at about half the posted price of Middle Eastern oil.

The meeting was contentious. The company had a new chairman, the no-nonsense Monroe Rathbone, known as “Jack.” Rathbone’s life was practically a textbook of the American oil industry.

Rathbone himself had studied chemical engineering, and then had gone to work right after World War I in Jersey’s huge refinery at Baton Rouge.

By September 10, representatives of the major exporting countries—Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran—had arrived in Baghdad. Qatar attended as an observer.

Yet, by September 14, the group had completed its work. A new entity had been established with which to confront the international oil companies. It was called the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and it made its intention clear: to defend the price of oil—more precisely, to restore it to its precut level. From.

They also called for a system of “regulation of production,”.

And they committed themselves to solidarity in case the companies sought to impose “sanctions” on one of them.

Could claim only two achievements in its early years. It ensured that the oil companies would be cautious about taking any major step unilaterally, without consultation.

And they would not dare cut the posted price again.

But by the middle 1950s, there was growing suspicion among geologists that the country might produce oil. To encourage exploration and development, the Libyan Petroleum Law of 1955 provided for a host of much smaller concessions, instead of the very large concession areas characteristic of the Persian Gulf countries. “I did not want Libya to begin as Iraq or as Saudi Arabia or as Kuwait,” explained the Libyan petroleum minister who oversaw the law. “I didn’t want my country to be in the hands of one oil company.” Libya would give many of the concessions to independent companies, which did not have oil production and concessions to protect in other countries in the Eastern Hemisphere, and thus would have no reason to hold back from exploring and producing as much, and as rapidly, as they could in Libya. The law offered another incentive. The government’s take would be pegged to the actual market price for its oil, which was lower than the increasingly fictional posted price. This meant that Libyan oil would be more profitable than oil from other countries, which was an excellent reason for any company to maximize its Libyan output.

Between 1960 and 1969, the market price for oil fell by 36 cents a barrel, a drop of 22 percent.

The global battle of production intensified the long-standing rivalry between the two key oil countries of the Middle East—Iran and Saudi Arabia. The swell of output around the world put the major companies in a political quandary.

There were many points of conflict between the two nations: one was Arab and one was not; one was Sunni Moslem and the other Shia Moslem. Each wanted to be the leader, both in the region and among oil producers, and each had unfulfilled territorial ambitions. Their competition over levels of oil production underscored the fundamental jealousy and suspicion between the two countries. For output translated into wealth; and wealth in turn meant power, influence, and respect.

“America does better by its enemies than it does by its friends,”.

If it can be said, in the abstract, that the sun energized the planet, it was oil that now powered its human population, both in its familiar forms as fuel and in the proliferation of new petrochemical products.

If it can be said, in the abstract, that the sun energized the planet, it was oil that now powered its human population, both in its familiar forms as fuel and in the proliferation of new petrochemical products. Oil emerged triumphant, the undisputed King, a monarch garbed in a dazzling array of plastics. He was generous to his loyal subjects, sharing his wealth to, and even beyond, the point of waste. His reign was a time of confidence, of growth, of expansion, of astonishing economic performance. His largesse transformed his kingdom, ushering in a new drive-in civilization. It was the Age of Hydrocarbon Man.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the price of oil fell until it became very cheap, which also contributed mightily to the swelling of consumption. Many governments encouraged its use to power economic growth and industrial modernization, as well as to meet social and environmental objectives. There was one final reason that the market for oil grew so rapidly. Each oil-exporting country wanted higher volumes of its oil sold in order to gain higher revenues. Using various mixtures of incentives and threats, many of these countries put continuing pressure on their concessionaires to produce more, and that, in turn, gave the companies powerful impetus to push oil aggressively into whatever new markets they could find.

1955, coal provided 75 percent of total energy use in Western Europe, and petroleum just 23 percent. By 1972, coal’s share had shrunk to 22 percent, while oil’s had risen to 60 percent—almost a complete flip-flop.

Then there was the great hullabaloo over gasoline additives. Their whole purpose was to carve out brand identification for a product, gasoline, that was, after all, a commodity that was more-or-less the same, whatever its brand name.

Absolute heart of the industry,” he would say. “Over and over, the lesson in this business is that if you can’t take disappointment, you ought not to be in this business, since 90 percent of what you drill are failures. You really have to take defeat regularly.” Still, the other 10 percent would prove very good to Anderson, not only making him very wealthy but also,.

You really have to take defeat regularly.” Still, the other 10 percent would prove very good to Anderson, not only making him very wealthy but also, among other things, enabling him to end up the largest individual landowner in the United States.

In the spring of 1967, the ARCO-Humble venture began drilling what would certainly be the last wildcat if it failed. The well was dubbed Prudhoe Bay State Number 1. On December 26, 1967, a loud, vibrating sound drew a crowd of about forty men to the well. They were wrapped in heavy clothes—it was thirty degrees below zero—and they had to struggle to hold their places in the thirty-knot wind. The noise grew louder and louder—the roar of natural gas. To one geologist it sounded like four jumbo jets flying directly overhead. A natural gas flare from a pipe shot defiantly thirty feet straight up in the strong wind. They had struck oil. In mid-1968, a “step-out well,” drilled seven miles from the discovery well, confirmed that this was a great structure, a world-class oil field. A true elephant.

In a bizarre twist, the embargo also extended to United States military forces in the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Sixth Fleet, among whose de facto responsibilities was the protection of some of those states that were imposing the embargo.

With the timely publication of Small is Beautiful in 1973, he had found, after decades of anonymity, his metier as spokesman for those who challenged the tenets of unbridled growth and the “bigger is better” philosophy that had dominated the 1950s and 1960s.

But the Royal Dutch/Shell Group was 60 percent owned by the Dutch and only 40 percent by the British. So,.

The Iranians had a rationale for their price. It was based not on supply and demand but on what the Shah called a “new concept,” the cost of alternative energy sources—liquids and gas made from coal and shale oil.

“The alternative source existed, in the volume required, only in economic theory, not in reality.”.

Oil prices were at the heart of world commerce, and those who seemed to control oil prices were regarded as the new masters of the global economy.

OPEC’s membership in the mid-1970s was virtually synonymous with all the world’s petroleum exporters, excepting the Soviet Union.

And OPEC’s members would determine if there was to be inflation or recession.

“a combination of producers to regulate the prices and the output of a commodity.” OPEC was certainly trying to set price, but not output—not.

“a combination of producers to regulate the prices and the output of a commodity.” OPEC was certainly trying to set price, but not output—not yet.

In 1975, for instance, about 45 percent of what the Western European consumer paid for oil products went to his government, while about 35 percent was accounted for by the OPEC price. The other 20 percent went for shipping, refining, dealer’s margins, and so forth. The argument had less validity for the United States, where the tax component was only 18 percent, while the share going to the OPEC exporter was more on the order of 50 percent. In Japan, the government took 28 percent, with 45 percent going to OPEC. Whatever the split, the consumer governments responded to the OPEC claim by saying that what they did within their borders and how they taxed their citizens was their own business, and that the macro-economic consequences of their sales taxes were strikingly different from that of the “OPEC tax.”.

Though OPEC was commonly said to be split between “radicals” and “moderates,” this same question was also the focus of a running battle between the two largest producers in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran.

For the Shah, the December 1973 price increase had been his great victory, and very much a personal one. From then on, he saw his moment and opportunity—the prospect of seemingly endless revenues, provided as if by divine intervention, to fulfill his ambitions to create what he called Iran’s Great Civilization, and, by the way, solve Iran’s mounting domestic economic problems. “One of the only things my husband likes in life,” said the Empress in the mid-1970s, “is flying, driving, driving boats—speed!” The Shah applied his passion for speed to his entire country in an attempt to hurtle Iran into the twenty-first century. In so doing, he would ignore the agitation and disorientation that such rapidity caused, as well as the resentment and unhappiness among the many who did not share his obsession with modernity. Iran, the Shah proclaimed, would become the world’s fifth largest industrial power; it would be a new West Germany, a second Japan. “Iran will be one of the serious countries in the world,” he boasted. “Everything you can dream of can be achieved here.”.

The Saudis feared that higher prices, and the expectation thereof, could set off a move away from oil to conservation and to other fuel sources that would change and contract that long-term market for oil and thus diminish the value of their reserves.

Megalomaniac,.

Further oil price hikes would only provide Iran with still more money and power, enabling it to buy even more weapons, thus shifting the strategic balance and encouraging the Shah to claim hegemony over the Gulf.

When the other exporters were looking for justification to raise prices, the Saudis in opposition would push up their production to try to weaken the market. But in so doing, they made a disconcerting discovery. Their sustainable production capacity was not as high as had been assumed.2.

Yamani had already been oil minister for eleven years and had developed considerable experience and skill, and superb negotiating talents. His voice was soft, forcing adversaries to strain and to be silent to hear what he said. He almost never lost his temper; the angrier he got, the more quiet he became. Flamboyant rhetoric was not his style. He went logically from point to point, dwelling on each long enough to draw out the essence, the connections, the imperatives, and the consequences. It was all so simple and persuasive and so overwhelmingly obvious and irrefutable that only a maniac or a simpleton could disagree.

Yamani carefully crafted his mystique; he was the master of patience and of the unblinking stare.

“In my public life, in my personal life, in everything I do I think long term,”.

“Once you start thinking short term, you are in trouble because short-term thinking is only a tactic for immediate benefit.”.

Criticized higher prices, the Shah quickly shot back, “No one can dictate to us. No one can wave a finger at us, because we will wave a finger back.”.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Nixon and Kissinger had established a “blank check” policy, giving the Shah a free hand to buy as many American weapons systems as he wanted, even the most technologically advanced, so long as they were not nuclear. The policy was part of the “twin pillars strategy,” established for regional security in the wake of the British withdrawal from the Gulf.

The Defense Department was alarmed by this blank check; in its view, Iran needed a strong conventional army, but not ultramodern weapons systems that it would have trouble mastering and that might fall into the hands of the Russians. Defense Secretary James Schlesinger personally cautioned the Shah that Iran lacked the technical resources to assimilate so many new and complex weapons systems. “He fell in love with the F-15,” said Schlesinger. While the Shah normally brushed aside such warnings, in the case of the F-15, he heeded the advice and did not purchase that particular aircraft.

As the Shah saw it, he was being asked by Carter to make a trade: to join Saudi Arabia in moderation on oil prices in exchange for the continued flow of arms from the United States and relief from the pressure on human rights. Carter stressed “the punishing impact of increased oil prices on the industrial economies.” Contradicting much of what he had said since the end of 1973, the Shah agreed with Carter, and he promised to urge the other OPEC countries to “give Western nations a break.”.

France also developed the most aggressive government policy on energy conservation. Inspectors would swoop down on banks, department stores, and offices and do “le check up”—take the inside temperature with special thermometers. If the temperature exceeded the officially approved twenty-degree-centigrade level, fines would be levied on the building management. But perhaps the most striking aspect of France’s overall energy conservation program, and an altogether French initiative, was the ban on any advertising that “encouraged” energy consumption.

But perhaps the most striking aspect of France’s overall energy conservation program, and an altogether French initiative, was the ban on any advertising that “encouraged” energy consumption. A manufacturer could advertise that his portable electric heater was more efficient than comparable heaters, but he could not say that electric heating was the best form of heating, because that encouraged energy use.

Exxon’s tiger was tamed in France; no longer in the tank, he was judiciously advising motorists to check their tires and tune their engines to save gasoline.

One of the two French national oil companies, Total, searched desperately for some way to keep its name in front of the public. At last, it had a brilliant idea. It started putting up billboards, picturing a beautiful piece of green French countryside, with a simple legend announcing “This is France” and signed “Total.” The ad was banned. A stunned Total asked why. “It is easy,” said Jean Syrota, the director of the Energy Conservation Agency. “Consumers look at this ad and say, ‘Oil companies are wasting a great deal of money on such ads, therefore the companies must be rich, therefore there must not be any energy problem, therefore it is all right to waste energy.’”1.

“There are three kinds of lies—lies, damn lies, and energy lies.” Later, Schlesinger would say, “I have a sort of World.

“I understand now what Hell is. Hell is endless and eternal sessions of the natural gas conference.”.

The number-one commandment was to avoid, at all costs, nationalism in the Third World. In any event, exploration in most of the OPEC countries was fore-closed because of nationalization, and there was a rather strong presupposition that, if a company had success in other developing countries, the fruits would be seized before they could be ingested, leaving only small pieces and bits for the company. So the companies redirected their exploration spending, to the degree possible, to the industrial countries of the Western world: to the United States, despite a growing pessimism about its oil potential, to Canada, and to the British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.

“Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it.”.

It had become evident in the mid-1970s that Iran simply could not absorb the vast increase in oil revenues that was flooding into the country. The petrodollars, megalomaniacally misspent on extravagant modernization programs or lost to waste and corruption, were generating economic chaos and social and political tension throughout the nation. The rural populace was pouring from the villages into the already-overcrowded towns and cities; agricultural output was declining, while food imports were going up. Inflation had seized control of the country, breeding all the inevitable discontents. A middle manager or a civil servant in Tehran spent up to 70 percent of his salary on rent. Iran’s infrastructure could not cope with the pressure suddenly thrust upon it; the backward railway system was overwhelmed; Tehran’s streets were jammed with traffic. The national electricity grid could not meet demand, and it broke down. Parts of Tehran and other cities were regularly blacked out, sometimes for four or five hours a day, a disaster for industrial production and domestic life and a further source of anger and discontent.

“We are melting away daily like snow in water.”.

American policy had been based on the premise that Iran was a reliable ally and would be the Big Pillar in the region.

Neither BP nor Shell were members of Aramco, so they had no direct access to the increased Saudi production, which went to the four American Aramco companies.

He began by invoking as his text The World Crisis, Winston Churchill’s history of World War I. It was in the pages of that book that Churchill wrote of his efforts to convert the British Navy from coal to oil, despite the risk that would come from depending upon oil from Iran. Now, six decades later, eerily and uncannily, that risk had become reality.

Young graduates in geology were wined and dined and courted, and paid fifty thousand dollars a year for their first job out of school.

Geologists with twenty years of experience were quitting the majors to put together deals and keep a piece for themselves, dreaming that they might become a new H. L. Hunt or the next J. Paul Getty.

Had interests on both sides of the divide. It was the world’s largest importer and consumer of oil, and yet it was also the world’s second-largest producer of oil, and a good part of its financial system had cast its fate with high oil prices. If push came to shove, on which side would the United States line up?.

By the middle 1980s, OPEC was faced with a critical choice. It could cut price; but where would a falling price stop? Or it could continue to prop up the price. But if it did that, it would be holding up an umbrella under which non-OPEC oil, competing energy sources, and conservation would all flourish, guaranteeing itself a shrinking market share.

First, this would undercut the large and expensive commitment they had made to alternative energy sources, leading, they were sure, back to higher oil dependence and eventually to renewed vulnerability, and setting the stage for another crisis. Second,.

There did not seem to be any long-term problem of supply; after all, proven world oil reserves had been mightily increased—from 670 billion barrels in 1984 to 1.0 trillion barrels in 1990.

Iraq was a closed police state, but Saddam Hussein’s objectives seemed clear: to dominate the Arab world, to gain hegemony over the Persian Gulf, to make Iraq into the predominant oil power—and ultimately to turn Greater Iraq into a global military power. But.

Over its entire history as an industry, oil has brought out both the best and worst of our civilization. It has been both boon and burden. Energy is the basis of industrial society. And of all energy sources, oil has loomed the largest and the most problematic because of its central role, its strategic character, its geographic distribution, the recurrent pattern of crisis in its supply—and the inevitable and irresistible temptation to grasp for its rewards.

Creativity, dedication, entrepreneur-ship, ingenuity, and technical innovation have coexisted with avarice, corruption, blind political ambition, and brute force.

It has given us our daily life and, literally, through agricultural chemicals and transportation, our daily bread.

The focus of the international community shifted from security to economics and growth and to what was coming to be known as globalization.

Of the world’s twenty largest oil companies, sixteen are state-owned.

The Russian industry is led by state-controlled giants Gazprom and Rosneft and as well by privately held companies, such as Lukoil, that are majors in their own right.

As such, The Prize is not only a history of the last 150 years. It is also a starting point for understanding how energy will shape the world of tomorrow.
