The spy was being spied upon by his fellow spies.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it. The Soviet spy service was in his heart.

Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it.

“Better that ten innocent people should suffer than one spy get away,” said Nikolai Yezhov, chief of the NKVD.

NKVD, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Stalin’s secret police and the precursor of the KGB.

“The NKVD is always right,” he said: a conclusion both wholly sensible and entirely wrong.

The elder Gordievsky was a prime example of the species Homo Sovieticus, an obedient state servant forged by Communist repression. But underneath he was fearful, horrified, and perhaps gnawed by guilt. Oleg later came to see his father as “a frightened man.”.

From boyhood, Oleg saw that it was possible to live a double life, to love those around you while concealing your true inner self, to appear to be one person to the external world and quite another inside.

For hours he would run, through Moscow’s streets and parks, alone with his thoughts.

“Only a physical barrier, reinforced by armed guards in their watchtowers, could keep the East Germans in their socialist paradise and stop them fleeing to the West.”.

“It was I, rather than she, who was being tested.”.

“ashamed of all those crimes and atrocities committed by the KGB, and simply afraid to discuss the work of the KGB with his own son.”.

.

The KGB’s “Red Banner” elite training academy, deep in the woods fifty miles north of Moscow, was code-named School 101, an ironic and entirely unconscious echo of George Orwell’s Room 101 in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the basement torture chamber where the Party breaks a prisoner’s resistance by subjecting him to his worst nightmare.

Gordievsky adopted his first spy name. Soviet and Western intelligence services used the same method for choosing a pseudonym—it should be close to the real name, with the same initial letter, because that way if a person addressed you by your real name, someone who only knew you by your spy name might well assume he or she had misheard. Gordievsky chose the name “Guardiyetsev.”.

There was calculation as well as control in this: a married KGB officer was considered less likely to defect while abroad, since his wife and family could be held as hostages.

Oleg was rejected for illegals work: according to KGB logic, having more than one family member abroad, and particularly having two in the same country, might be an inducement to defect.

There was a very good reason, he reflected, why ordinary Soviet citizens were not permitted to travel abroad: who but a fully indoctrinated KGB officer would be able to taste such freedoms and resist the urge to stay?.

The rezident, Leonid Zaitsev, a charming and conscientious officer, seemed oblivious to the fact that most of his underlings were incompetent, lazy, or crooked, and usually all three. They expended far more energy on fiddling their expenses than actually spying.

The broad remit of the KGB was to cultivate Danish contacts, recruit informants, and target possible agents. This, Gordievsky swiftly realized, was “an invitation to corruption,” since most officers simply invented their interactions with Danes, falsified bills, made up their reports, and pocketed their allowances. The Center does not appear to have noticed the anomaly that few of its personnel in Copenhagen spoke good Danish, and some spoke none at all.

He spoke English with a fruity upper-class accent, larded with old-fashioned Britishisms (What ho! Pip pip!), making him sound like a Russian Bertie Wooster.

He attended classical-music concerts, devoured library books, and traveled to every corner of Denmark, sometimes on spy business, but mostly for the sheer pleasure of being able to do so.

To work off his frustration, he ran every day in Copenhagen’s parks, alone, for hour after hour, returning home too exhausted to quarrel.

The Prague Spring was over, and a new Soviet winter began.

Englishman, a cheerful, back-slapping fellow who referred to the people he liked as “complete darlings” and those he did not as “prize shits.”.

Richard Bromhead was one of those Englishmen who put a great deal of effort into appearing to be a lot stupider than they really are. He was a formidable intelligence officer.

(the grease that oils the wheels of so much espionage),.

One of the oldest gambits in intelligence is “the dangle,” when one side appears to make a play for someone on the other, lures him into complicity, and gains his trust, before exposing him.

Here, finally, was the hint of collusion—not a flash of leg exactly, but the glimpse of an ankle.

In spying, as in love, a little distance, a little uncertainty, an apparent cooling on one side or the other can stimulate desire.

“Search for people who are hurt by fate or nature—the ugly, those suffering from an inferiority complex, craving power and influence but defeated by unfavorable circumstances….In cooperation with us, all these find a peculiar compensation. The sense of belonging to an influential and powerful organization will give them a feeling of superiority over the handsome and prosperous people around them.”.

“Intelligence agents, in my experience, are even bigger liars than journalists.”.

A degree of intellectual snobbery is common to most, the secret sense of knowing important things unknown to the person standing next to you at the bus stop. In part, spying is an act of the imagination.

Oleg Penkovsky, the Russian spy who furnished the West with crucial intelligence during the Cuban Missile Crisis, hoped to prevent nuclear war, but he also wanted prostitutes and chocolates brought to his London hotel, and demanded to meet the Queen.

He was looking for revenge, for fulfillment, but also for love.

Spies want to feel wanted, part of a secret community, rewarded, trusted, and cherished.

“a marvellous man…[who] looked at you as if nothing more important in life than you and talking to you existed at that moment.”.

The Russian euphemism for the summary death sentence was vyshaya mera, “highest measure”: the traitor was taken into a room, made to kneel, and then shot in the back of the head. Sometimes the KGB was more imaginative. It was said that Penkovsky had been cremated alive and his death filmed, as a warning to potential turncoats.

Leila knew from the outset, without ever being told, that Gordievsky was a KGB officer. The thought that his interest in such books might conceal a deeper dissidence never crossed her mind.

Double infidelity with precision and care. Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

Every few days, he would send a disguised message to Leila and commit adultery in a different Copenhagen hotel; every four weeks, he would make his way to an unremarkable flat in a boring Danish suburb and commit treason.

The KGB officers in Copenhagen, Oleg explained, spent far more time inventing contacts in order to justify their expenses than actually meeting anyone. This reassuring intelligence was passed on to PET.

During the war, the Hanslope boffins produced an astonishing array of technical gadgets for spies, including secure radios, secret ink, and even garlic-flavored chocolate—issued to spies parachuting into occupied France to ensure their breath smelled convincingly French on landing.

He abandoned his own refusal to reveal names and identified every KGB officer, every illegal, and every source. Finally, he agreed to accept money.

Love often begins with an outpouring of naked truth, a passionate baring of the soul.

The friendship was also a betrayal.

“The purpose of this was twofold: if Oleg just wanted reassurance that we were continuously looking out for his interests, he could see us but not make himself visible. If he wanted to make a brush contact and pass on a physical message, he would make himself visible by means of the gray cap and Safeway bag.”.

Only years after his death did Gordievsky learn that his father had been married before he met Olga, and may have had children by this earlier, hidden marriage. Oleg,.

“Real happiness is to queue all night, and then get what you want,”.

Here was further indication that Arne Treholt was an active KGB agent.

“To my good friend Oleg—Don’t believe anything you see in print! Kim Philby.”.

The KGB offered a 10 percent salary increase to officers who passed an official foreign-language course, with a maximum of two languages.

He read Churchill’s History of the Second World War, Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal, and Fielding’s Tom Jones.

The problem with buttering up the boss is that bosses tend to move on, which can mean a lot of wasted butter.

Jack Jones was one of the most respected figures in the trade union movement, a crusading socialist once described by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as “one of the world’s greatest trade union leaders.” He was also a KGB agent.

Lenin is often credited with coining the term “useful idiot,” poleznyi durak in Russian, meaning one who can be used to spread propaganda without being aware of it or subscribing to the goals intended by the manipulator.

His colleagues were convinced Britain would be defeated by plucky little Argentina.

Tall and spare, with thick spectacles and a mustache that never seemed fully confident of itself, he was hard to spot in a group and invisible in a crowd.

He wore a trench coat to look like a spy, and practiced magic tricks. He liked fooling people.

Ames was intelligent and imaginative, but reality never seemed to measure up to his hopes or furnish him with what he considered his just deserts.

“If asked to do something he didn’t want to do, he didn’t argue: he just didn’t do it,”.

“Lying is wrong, son, but if it serves a greater good, it’s OK,”.

Greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

And a greedy spy was worth more than an ideological one, because “once you had the money hooks in, it was easier to hold them and play them.”.

Disloyalty was not a sin, but an operational tool.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared.

“The essence of espionage is betrayal of trust,” Ames declared. He was wrong: the essence of successful agent running is the maintenance of trust, the supplanting of one allegiance by another, higher, loyalty.

“Remember ’68”—to give the impression that the Turkish population was outraged by the Soviet invasion. He dumped the posters in a bin and went for a drink.

The revelation that Richard Nixon had used the CIA to try to obstruct a federal investigation into the Watergate burglary in 1972 triggered a crisis within the agency and a series of investigations into its activities over the preceding twenty years.

After nearly twenty years in the CIA he understood the workings of the agency, but his career was stagnating, for which he blamed everybody else.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came.

By mid-1982 Ames was slipping into a rut: disgruntled, lonely, peevish, and unfulfilled, but too lazy and boozy to do anything to arrest the slide. Then Rosario came into his life, and the lights came on.

“She was like a breath of fresh air entering a room stale with cigar smoke,”.

There was nothing special about Ames—and that, perhaps, was the problem.

Paranoia is born of propaganda, ignorance, secrecy, and fear.

The escape plan from Moscow, Operation PIMLICO, would be kept in readiness while he was in London. The KGB was generous in its holiday entitlement, and officers tended to return on annual leave for four weeks in the winter and up to six weeks in the summer. He might also be summoned back at short notice. Whenever he was in Moscow, MI6 officers would continue to check the signal sites at the bread shop on Kutuzovsky Prospekt and the Central Market, looking out for a man with a Safeway bag. They would even do so when the spy was not in the country. The KGB closely watched all British diplomats in Moscow and bugged their apartments, while surveillance posts monitored their movements from the top of the Hotel Ukraine and the roof of the foreigners’ apartment block. Any deviation from routine might be noticed; if they regularly walked past the bread shop when Gordievsky was in Moscow, stopped doing so when he was absent, and started again when he returned, the pattern might just be detected.

But there was one aspect of the Gordievsky trove that made the top brass of British intelligence and security sit up and swallow, hard.

The Kremlin, however, assuming that capitalism penetrated every aspect of Western life, believed that a “blood bank” was, in fact, a bank, where blood could be bought and sold.

In a craven and hierarchical organization, the only thing more dangerous than revealing your own ignorance is to draw attention to the stupidity of the boss.

But obedience was more powerful than common sense in the world of Soviet intelligence, and KGB stations across the world dutifully began searching for evidence of hostile plans.

In spy jargon such information is known as “chicken feed,” genuine but not seriously damaging information that can be given to an enemy to establish an agent’s bona fides, bulky, filling, but lacking in any real nutritional value.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that.

She believed she was deceiving him; and he was deceiving her by allowing her to think that. He was using her to improve his standing within the KGB. She thought she was striking a blow against the Soviet Union. Here was another example of the combined trickery and tenderness inherent in espionage: a friendship between a British Tory researcher and a Russian Soviet diplomat, both of whom were secret spies. They were lying to each other, with genuine affection.

He would eventually betray the entire CIA spy network inside the Soviet Union, sending many agents to their deaths.

Working out of Deverell’s office, they were sealed off from the rest of MI5 while they dug, a secret cell within a secret department of a secret organization.

A mole does not just foment mistrust. Like a heretic, he undermines the coherence of faith itself.

Storm trooper,”.

Bettaney wanted to know, and conceal, a bigger secret than the spy sitting alongside him.

Felt I needed radically to influence events.” Bettaney did not want money, revolution, or world peace; he wanted attention.

If the marks of potential treachery are being clever, eccentric, and inclined to have a few too many drinks, then half the wartime and postwar spies in Britain and America would have been suspect.

There was a hidden solitude in the heart of his marriage.

“Do they ever ask themselves what is the purpose of life? What is it all for?…No. Their creed is barren of conscience, immune to the promptings of good and evil.”.

The psychological gratification of all intelligence work lies in knowing more than your adversaries, but also more than your allies.

“Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”.

The CIA had won a small but satisfying professional victory over MI6. The Brits thought they knew something the Americans did not know; but now the CIA knew something that MI6 did not know they knew. That is how the game is played. Oleg Gordievsky was assigned the random CIA code name TICKLE, a neutral-sounding label to go with a little harmless international rivalry.

“Everyone has a right to their own strangeness.”.

Ames was truculent. His breath smelled and his job stank. He felt underappreciated by the CIA. But he would later offer a simpler explanation for his actions: “I did it for the money.” He needed to pay for Rosario’s shopping trips to Neiman Marcus and dinners at the Palm restaurant. He wanted to move out of his one-bedroom apartment, pay off his ex-wife, hold an expensive wedding, and own his car outright.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved.

Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved. Gordievsky had never been interested in the money. Ames was interested in nothing else.

The KGB was a cumbersome beast, but it could move fast when it needed to.

His systematic betrayal of every Soviet agent on the CIA’s books would not take place for another month. In memoirs published in 2005, Cherkashin claimed the crucial tip-off about Gordievsky came not from Ames, but from a shadowy informant, “a Washington-based British journalist.” The CIA dismisses this as disinformation designed to reflect well on the KGB, with “all the earmarks of being a false lead.”.

In the 1980s he had served in East Germany, where one of the KGB officers under his command was the young Vladimir Putin.

He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor.

It is perfectly possible for two people to listen to the same words and hear entirely different things. This was one of those moments. Brown thought he was offering Oleg a way out, while reminding him that this might waste a golden opportunity. Gordievsky believed he was being instructed to return to Moscow. He was hoping to hear his case officer say that he had done enough, and he should now stand down with honor. But Brown, as instructed, gave no such direction. The decision was Gordievsky’s.

“People say that when soldiers hear the artillery start, they go into a sort of panic. That is what happened to me. I could not even remember the escape plan. But then I thought: ‘The plan is unreliable anyway. I should forget about it, and just look forward to the bullet in the back of the neck.’ I was paralyzed.”.

Here he was being accused of treason, and the chief investigator was defending the quality of KGB sandwiches.

When the senior MI6 officer liaising with the MI5 eavesdropping team was asked how the alarm raised by Gordievsky could possibly have been missed, he offered a quotation from Horace: Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus, often translated as “Even Homer nods.” The most highly trained experts can still be caught napping.

Price had been told that the mosquitoes could be fierce on the Russian-Finnish border in early summer. So she bought some mosquito repellent.

The only way husband and wife could communicate at home was by passing notes, in bed, under the sheets. Usually these were written in fountain pen with soluble ink on toilet paper that could then be flushed. “We were under constant watch. There was almost no privacy, ever, anywhere. It was exhausting, and quite stressful.” Even in the embassy, the only place to be sure a conversation was not overheard was the “safe-speech room” in the basement, “a sort of Portakabin surrounded by noise within an empty space.”.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance.

She did not know that his colleagues no longer met his eye, and that he sat at an empty desk all day. He did not tell her that their flat was bugged, or that they were under twenty-four-hour KGB surveillance. He told her nothing, and she believed him.

‘I am your rock,’ I said. ‘Don’t worry. Drink if you want to. I don’t mind.’ ”.

The many perks of KGB membership included access to various health spas and holiday centers.

“All of the people on my June 13 list knew the risks they were taking. If one of them learned about me, he would have told the CIA and I would have been arrested and thrown in jail…It wasn’t personal. It was simply how the game was played.”.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare:.

In all totalitarian cultures, the individual is encouraged to consider the interests of society before personal welfare: from Nazi Germany to Communist Russia to Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and North Korea today, a willingness to betray those nearest to you for the greater good was the ultimate mark of committed citizenship and ideological purity.

The decision to leave his family behind was either an act of monumental self-sacrifice, or one of selfish self-preservation, or both. He told himself he had no choice, which is what we all tell ourselves when forced to make a terrible choice.

And part of his heart broke.

William Shakespeare has an answer for most of life’s questions. In Hamlet, the greatest writer in the English language pondered the nature of fate and courage, when life’s challenges seem overwhelming. “When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.”.

It was Arthur Gee’s turn to monitor the signal site, but the traffic was slow.

“I drove on, feeling as if the world had fallen in and I had done the wrong thing, for the right reasons.”.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the.

Admitting to failure was not a career-enhancing move in the KGB.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him.

The Finns did not want to know anything in advance, and if Gordievsky was intercepted in Finland by the Finnish authorities, he would almost certainly be returned to the Soviet Union. If he was not, and the Soviets discovered he was there, the Finns would come under intense pressure to seize him. And if they did not, the KGB was perfectly capable of sending a Spetsnaz special forces squad to do the job. The Soviets were known to monitor Finnish airports, so simply flying the family out of Helsinki was not an option.

She packed mosquito repellent, clean clothes, and a shaving kit.

She hoped the Moscow team would remember to bring additional spare tires, in good condition, in case of punctures. That, too, was in the escape plan.

“I am quite certain that the prime minister will feel we have an overwhelming moral duty to save this man.”.

“We’ll say it’s a gross provocation. We’ll say they shoved the fellow in the boot of the car.”.

Gordievsky made his preparations, appearing to do the sorts of things a man who was about to escape would not do.

His fate was now back in his own hands.

“Mr. Harrington’s Washing” is the tale of a British spy who escapes from revolutionary Russia through Finland.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the.

Risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

The story is about risk—“man has always found it easier to sacrifice his life than to learn the multiplication table”—and getting out in time. Ashenden takes the train and escapes through Finland.

Whether or not he escaped, the KGB would comb through the transcripts of his telephone conversations afterward, and realize they had been mocked: they would hate him all the more, but perhaps admire him, too.

(“It was so secret I later had a problem getting my expenses reimbursed.”).

The royal courtier fumed. If you are a private secretary, there is nothing more galling than another private secretary being more private than you are.

“She admired him hugely even though it cut against some of her principles—she hated traitors. But he was different. In a different league. She had huge respect for those who stood up to the regime.”.

He did nothing that might seem out of the ordinary, on the most extraordinary day of his life.

Then he ran through the full surveillance-evasion menu, methodically and meticulously: jumping on a Metro train as the door closed, alighting after two stops, waiting for the next train to arrive and then making certain every passenger on the platform had boarded before letting the doors close and catching a train in the opposite direction; ducking down one street, doubling back and up another, into a shop by one entrance and then out of the back.

“A thick mist had risen from the lakes and rivers, extending into long belts beside the hills and through the trees and villages. The land slowly coalesced into substantial forms out of these foaming banks of violet and rose. Three very bright planets shone out in perfect symmetry, one to the left, one to the right, and one straight ahead. We passed solitary figures already scything hay, picking herbs, or taking cows to pasture along the slopes and gullies of common land. It was a stunning sight, an idyllic moment. It was difficult to believe that any harm could come out of a day of such beginnings.”.

In Communist lore, the Finland Station is symbolic of revolutionary liberty and the birth of the Soviet Union; to Gordievsky it also represented the route to freedom, but in the opposite direction, in every sense, to Lenin.

Instead, they seem to have done what timeservers do in every autocracy that punishes honest failure: they did nothing at all, and hoped the problem would go away.

“I felt an extraordinary period of stillness at the center of the turning world,” Simon Brown recalled. He had brought along Hotel du Lac, the Booker Prize–winning novel by Anita Brookner. “I thought if I took a long book it would be tempting fate, so I took a short book.”.

Weekends are lethargic times in all large bureaucracies, when the second-tier staff comes to work and the boss relaxes.

They were playing Finlandia.

Veronica Price did not approve of emotional displays, but she was visibly moved, “her expression a mixture of recognition and love.”.

Gordievsky waved away the sandwiches and fruit juice Price had carefully packed. “I wanted whisky,” he said later. “Why didn’t they give me whisky?” Brown had expected him to be hysterical with exhaustion, but instead Gordievsky seemed “perfectly controlled.”.

Gently raised the question of his family. “It was.

“It was too much of a risk to bring them,” Gordievsky said flatly, and stared out of the window at the passing Finnish countryside.

If the KGB was still watching, they would have noticed that Rachel Gee’s bad back had miraculously recovered.

“Look. Let’s be clear. I was a wife. My job was to clean, cook, shop, sleep with him, have children, share the bed, and be his friend. I was good at it. I’m grateful he didn’t tell me anything. For six years of my life I was a perfect wife. I did everything for him. You, the KGB, you have thousands of people with salaries whose job was to check up on people; they checked him and checked him and cleared him. And you come to me and blame me? Don’t you think that sounds stupid? You didn’t do your job. It wasn’t my job, it was yours. You ruined my life.”.

Among those affected was Vladimir Putin, a product of the Leningrad KGB who saw most of his friends, colleagues, and patrons purged as a direct consequence of Gordievsky’s escape.

From his point of view he was my savior. But who put me in the shit-hole? He’d forgotten the first part. You can’t kick someone off a cliff and then put out a hand and say: ‘I saved you!’ He was so bloody Russian.” Leila could not forget, or get over, what had happened to her. They tried to reassemble a family life, but the marriage that existed before the escape was from another world, another time, and could not be wished back to life.

In the end, she felt Gordievsky’s loyalty to an idea had taken precedence over his love for her.

Ames spied for money; Gordievsky was driven by ideological conviction. Ames’s victims were rooted out by the KGB and, in most cases, killed; the people Gordievsky exposed, such as Bettaney and Treholt, were watched, intercepted, tried by due process, imprisoned, and eventually released back into society. Gordievsky risked his life for a cause; Ames wanted a bigger car. Ames chose to serve a brutal totalitarian regime for which he felt no affinity, a country where he would never have considered living; Gordievsky had tasted democratic freedom, and made it his mission to defend and support that way of life and culture, finally settling in the West at huge personal cost. In the end, the difference between them is a matter of moral judgment: Gordievsky was on the side of the good; and Ames was on his own side.

He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

Oleg Gordievsky still lives a double life. To his suburban neighbors, the bowed, bearded old man living quietly behind the tall hedges is just another old-age pensioner, a person of little consequence. In reality he is someone else entirely, a figure of profound historical importance and a remarkable man: proud, shrewd, irascible, his brooding manner illuminated by sudden flashes of ironic humor. He is sometimes hard to like, and impossible not to admire. He has no regrets, he says, but from time to time he will break off in mid-conversation and stare darkly into a distance only he can see. He is one of the bravest people I have ever met, and one of the loneliest.

It contained the following: a Mars bar, a plastic Harrods bag, a map of western Russia, pills “for the relief of worry, irritability, insomnia and stress,” mosquito repellent, two bottles of chilled beer, and two cassette tapes: Dr. Hook’s Greatest Hits and Sibelius’s Finlandia.

They deserve far greater credit than I can give them; but, to their credit, they do not want it.
