Asia contains half of the world’s largest countries by land area, including Russia, China, Australia, India, and Kazakhstan.

When nations graduate from common geography into meaningful interactions, a system is born.

“It is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the security of Asia.”.

Fundamentally, Asians seek not conquest but respect.

Fundamentally, Asians seek not conquest but respect. A sufficient degree of respect for one another’s interests is enough.

The biggest geopolitical phenomena of the past three decades have come in rapid succession: the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the consolidation of the European Union, the rise of China, the US shale energy revolution, and now the emergence of an Asian system.

The outsourcing of US jobs to Asia and the erosion of the country’s industrial base were among the most salient causes of working-class frustration that propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

These examples reflect how Asians view the United States: not as a hegemon but as a service provider. US weapons, capital, oil, and technology are utilities in a global marketplace. The United States is a vendor, and Asia has become its largest customer and competitor at the same time. There was a time when the United States was the default option for the provision of security, capital, and technology, but Asian countries are increasingly providing these services for one another. The United States is more dispensable than it thinks.

The “global financial crisis” was not global: Asian growth rates continued to surge, and almost all the world’s fastest-growing economies are in Asia.

China wants foreign resources and markets, not foreign colonies.

Asianization is emerging as the newest sedimentary layer in the geology of global civilization.

Asianization takes many forms but is universally palpable: selling commodities to China, recruiting software engineers from India, buying oil from Saudi Arabia, taking vacations in Japan or Indonesia, recruiting nurses from the Philippines, hosting construction crews from Korea, doing apprenticeships in the UAE, and other relationships. Asian businesspeople strut around the world as their passports gain more visa-free privileges.

Asianization is like an additional layer of paint on an already colorful canvas; it adds texture and hues.

At the same time, becoming more Asian does not necessarily mean becoming less American or European. Asianization is like an additional layer of paint on an already colorful canvas; it adds texture and hues.

“a hundred schools of thought” flourished. The military theorist Sun Tzu compiled his treatise The Art of War, which revealed strategies in espionage and battlefield tactics.

The princess of Ayodhya in India even married into Korean royalty.

Almost 100 percent of India’s goods trade transits through either the Suez Canal or the Strait of Malacca.

Pakistan also has one of Asia’s leading AI outsourcing companies, Afiniti, which has more than three thousand employees and a valuation of $2 billion.

At the same time, Indians are the fastest-growing number of illegal immigrants, whether by overstaying their visas or by trying to enter the United States via Mexico.

California has by far the largest number of Asians at nearly 7 million, followed by New York with 2 million.

Indians have the highest median household incomes, followed by Filipinos and Japanese, then Chinese, Pakistanis, and Koreans.

All of this ethnodemographic-diplomatic drama could be just the beginning given the high-level Canadian government discussions on how to increase the country’s population from the current 35 million to potentially 100 million by the end of the century.

Certainly, over the past two generations, millions of Asians have settled in the United States and become proud Asian Americans. Most of their children—whether American-born Chinese (ABC) or American-born confused desi (ABCD) for Indians—think of themselves simply as American—no ethnic prefix hyphenation needed—and will only ever have American passports.

The majority of Asians coming to the United States for education are therefore not new Asian anchors but rather opportunists, taking the best of American academic expertise and entrepreneurial culture back to their homelands, where they can be among extended family and make a greater difference to their national futures.

“Africans to solve African problems in an African way.”.

The rule of law is so strong in South Korea that the country impeached a sitting president and jailed him for more than two decades and is now implementing strict term limits.

Asians do not lack an interest in democracy or the ability to sustain it. But they do have a no-nonsense bias in favor of pragmatic government and are culturally cautious about becoming collectively undisciplined.

Pew Research Center surveys conducted worldwide suggest that people do not want democracy at the price of corruption and incompetence.

A prominent survey reveals that from World War II to today, the percentage of Americans who feel it is “essential to live in a democracy” has fallen from three-quarters to under one-third.

Everyday people don’t measure these things by how.

All societies want a balance of prosperity and livability, openness and protection, effective governance and citizen voice, individualism and cohesion, free choice and social welfare. Everyday people don’t measure these things by how democratic their country is but by whether they feel safe in their cities, can afford their homes, have stability in their work, have a plan for growing old, and can remain connected to friends and family.

But, as Plato foresaw, only an educated population can responsibly assume democratic rights.

Despite all of this inclusive dialogue, Singapore.

Despite all of this inclusive dialogue, Singapore does not overconsult. Deliberation never degenerates into paralysis.

Singapore’s civil service is second to none. It is run like a spiral staircase: with each rung a civil servant learns to manage a different portfolio, gaining firsthand experience and building a broad knowledge base. By contrast, US politics is like an elevator: one can get in on the bottom floor and go straight to the top, missing all the learning in between.

One successful antibody against corruption is having highly paid ministers whose visibility demands that they view government service as a trusteeship rather than as a pathway to later wealth.

Civil servants earn high salaries and also receive modest bonuses tied to national economic performance.

Singapore’s people are far more interested in tangible delivery outputs than in democratic inputs for their own sake.

China is the only country in the world in which about forty years of training are required before one is allowed to wield federal authority.

As one Chinese scholar remarked, “Chinese people don’t love their government, but they trust it.”.

Indonesian factory owners and landholders buy parliament seats to shape regulations to their benefit.

Failures may be forgiven, but they are never forgotten.

When governments enjoy trust, they can not only pursue long-term transformation but also act decisively in crisis, whether an economic downturn or a sudden geopolitical shock. Because such Asian leaders think in generational rather than electoral terms and lines of authority are clear, everyone knows exactly where the buck stops. Neither political nor corporate leaders can slip into anonymity and wash away their sins. Failures may be forgiven, but they are never forgotten.

China is at the forefront of using big data as a tool to encourage behavioral conformity.

China is at the forefront of using big data as a tool to encourage behavioral conformity. Drawing on data from Alibaba, Tencent, and other platforms, authorities use the new social credit system (SCS) to determine which citizens have committed dishonorable acts and issue penalties. Some have been denied loans, cannot buy airline or train tickets, have had their passports suspended, or temporarily lose their Internet access. Though seemingly Orwellian from the outside, many (if not most) Chinese want greater transparency into what the government monitors—and now, for better or worse, they know. Importantly, the social credit system also cracks down on restaurants that sell contaminated food and vendors selling counterfeit goods. Reputation has long been an important currency in Asian societies, and now it applies to everyone in the social and commercial marketplace.

When the United States was spending heavily on its global military presence and others were able to keep their budgets down, it was called a security umbrella. When China recycles its trade surpluses and reserves into low-cost infrastructure for dozens of countries, why don’t we call it a development platform? When the United States requires that all dollar transactions be cleared by US banks so the US Treasury can sanction financial flows, it is considered to be upholding the financial system. But when Alibaba provides a platform for millions of SMEs to seamlessly trade with one another worldwide, why is it not called a breakthrough in global peer-to-peer commerce?.

The vast diversity of Asian tongues from Arabic, Turkish, and Farsi to Chinese, Vietnamese, and Bahasa is a salient reminder that Asians will always struggle to speak with one voice.

The time of the Beatles’ late-1960s retreat to India to study Transcendental Meditation is widely considered to have been one of the band’s most productive periods. In the mid-1970s, Steve Jobs wandered India barefoot wearing only a lungi, an ascetic seeking purity and Buddhist inspiration, before returning to California to apply his quest for inner perfection to computing hardware by cofounding Apple.

Mindfulness courses are part of career enhancement at Google and General Mills, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credits mindfulness with his turnaround of the company’s strategy.

Dubai is mandating that one-third of homes and offices be constructed using 3D printed materials, meaning easy-to-assemble modular construction requiring much less labor, and Oman wants to use drones rather than Bangladeshis to water its parks.

Indian and Japanese authors in particular have attained mass global audiences, notably Haruki Murakami (Norwegian Wood) and Amitav Ghosh (The Glass Palace), as well as the Afghan-born Khaled Hosseini (The Kite Runner).
