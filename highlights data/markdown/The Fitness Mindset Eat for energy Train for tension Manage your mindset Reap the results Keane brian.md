1g of carbohydrates has 4 calories 1g of protein has 4 calories 1g of fat has 9 calories Various foods are a compilation of these three building blocks. Therefore, if you know how many carbohydrates, fats and proteins are present in any given food item, you can calculate how many calories or how much energy that food contains. Below is an example of the formula for calculating the number of calories in a food.

Further in this chapter, I will discuss how making one simple change – eliminating or greatly reducing processed foods – can have an incredibly beneficial impact on your body’s ability to burn body fat or build lean muscle.

Combining legumes with sunflower seeds, sesame seeds or nuts such as walnuts, almonds or cashew provides complete proteins. One of my personal favourites is a trail mix of nuts, cashews, sunflower seeds with hummus or guacamole dip and raw vegetables.

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that keeps your nerves and blood cells healthy.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen.

If you are a vegetarian, vegan, smoker or drinker, you should seriously consider adding B12 to your supplement regimen. Personally, I use vitamin B12 spray every single day for the regulation of my nervous system, which can also reduce stress, worry and anxiety. However, there are numerous other benefits to adding B12 to your supplement regimen if you are not consuming it from food.

Long-term deficiency puts you at a risk of nerve degeneration, mental disturbance and depression amongst a host of other problems.

Once these symptoms manifest, it’s nearly impossible to fully recover. The take-home message is to make sure that you get enough vitamin B12 from your meat or consider adding it to your supplement regimen. Personally, I only eat red meat once or twice a week, so I hedge my bets and supplement with.

‘The first recorded heart attack was in 1912 and by 1930 the number of heart attacks had reached 3,000 and by 1960, there were over 500,000 deaths recorded from heart attacks.’.

Modern breakfast cereals and cereal bars for example are so highly processed, high in sugar and devoid of absorbable nutrients that they leave you fighting a losing blood sugar battle for the rest of the day. The answer is to eat more fat.

Vegans who eat more seeds tend to have much higher levels of omega 3 as well.

Omega 3 is actively involved in critical biological functions such as improving cognitive abilities, helping you retain information better, helping you perform complicated tasks more effectively, alleviating pain and inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity.

Nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews).

Seeds (pumpkin, linseed, chia).

Keeping your energy and blood sugar levels stable and in balance can allow you to train harder without getting food cravings associated with blood sugar drops, which can come from missing meals and snacks. This can give you a significantly better quality of life by increasing your overall energy levels, as a result helping you lose body fat and/or building lean muscle in the process.

This means that if you consume 200mg of caffeine at 12 midday, 100mg will still be in your system at 5pm.

‘unless people get to bed by 10:30pm and get a full eight hours of sleep, they’re wasting their money’.

Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

Too much protein can raise the alertness chemical in the brain called orexin, which can disrupt your sleep. Therefore, it’s important not to have ‘too much’ protein before bed.

The Honey Prescription, a small amount of raw honey has a similar effect on relaxing your body before bed. Furthermore, combining honey with some MCT oil will not throw you out of the fat-burning mode, as the shortest-length MCT derived from a supplement produces ketones even in the presence of carbohydrates.

GABA is great at bed time, but can also be used during the day if you’re highly stressed or dealing with anxiety.

Also sold as 5HTP, L-tryptophan is normally talked about after Christmas or thanksgiving dinner, as turkey is particularly high in this amino acid. L-tryptophan can allow your brain to release serotonin (one of our brains happy hormones), which can help you unwind before bed.

A 2% drop in body water can cause a small yet critical shrinkage of the brain, which can impair coordination and massively decrease concentration. Dehydration can also reduce endurance, decrease strength, cause cramping and slow-down muscular response.

There are numerous different training systems and styles that can work great for people, but I’ve found that in order to build a leaner, more muscular or toned physique, there’s one thing that you need to do above all else – tear muscle fibres by creating tension on the muscle.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout.

Instead of those calories adding inches to your waistline, training effectively gives them another job to do – repair from the workout. In order for your muscles to repair, your metabolism has to increase, lending itself to burning more calories while you rest.

Tension-style training means keeping the muscle you are working under optimal tension throughout the duration of the movement, i.e. two seconds on the way down, 1 second hold at the bottom or top and two seconds on the way up (2:1:2).

The take-home message is that it’s not about moving the weight from A to B – the aim is to create optimal tension for the duration of the movement and actually ‘feel’ the muscle you are working as a mind–muscle connection.

The best piece of gym advice that I have received was ‘Leave your ego at the door’.

Form: it’s not about the weight, it’s about how you move the weight.

Both systems work incredibly well and can be used interchangeably. My advice would be to use a rest pause on busier gym days, so that you don’t lose your bench or need extra sets of dumbbells and use drop sets when training at home or on quieter gym days.

Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

Aerobic activity by its very nature requires fat to be used as a primary fuel source, with carbohydrates and protein being used to a smaller extent. Therefore, if fat loss is your primary goal, some degree of aerobic work will help you a lot.

There is no ‘one best cardio’ or aerobic activity. The key is to find the one you enjoy the most, which your body responds to, normally by reducing body fat and then using that as your primary source of cardio. If you hate to run, try swimming or cycling. If you love team sports, join a sports club and get your cardio that way.

Note: 70% of your max heart rate is your ‘fat-burning zone’ – to calculate your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, if you are 28, it would be 220 minus 28, which is 192.

137-138 heart rate.

LISS is a good tool if your diet is clean – your carbs are low and you’re eating regular meals throughout the day alongside your weight-training program. But I’ve found that you do need to do longer spells of LISS, normally 15–20 minutes or more to see any noticeable changes.

HIIT on the other hand is ‘sprint training’. Its benefits are that it’s quick (five to ten minutes normally), burns through more glycogen (stored carbohydrates) and gives you a great feeling of accomplishment upon finish. Its negatives are that it’s difficult. And when done correctly, very difficult!.

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.).

For 30:30 HIIT, you have 30 seconds ‘on’ or sprint time and 30 seconds ‘off’ for rest or recovery time. This can be done on a bike, treadmill, with battle ropes or bodyweight movements (spider push-ups/burpee, etc.). The key is to go as hard as possible for 30 seconds and then completely rest or recover for the next 30 seconds.

Depleting your glycogen levels by doing your weight training first and your cardio after could potentially allow you to tap into fat stores more effectively. Of course, as long as you are doing your cardio or getting your heart rate up alongside all the other tips mentioned in this book, you will burn body fat. This is just a quick tip that could potentially allow you to do it faster.

For 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout. Her pre-workout meal was chicken or fish, mixed vegetables and one tablespoon of almond butter or 150g of sweet potato. As she is focused on tension during her weight training, she is burning through all the glucose in her body at a pretty rapid rate – she’s not even half way through her workout, and is now very likely to be tapping into her stored carbohydrates (glycogen). Twenty minutes later, her glycogen is nearly completely depleted and she is now using fat as her primary fuel source. She finishes her workout with 10 minutes of HIIT. Two months later, Jane is leaner, fitter, slimmer, more toned, feels better and continues to train for the rest of the year.

Jane Smith trains four days every week for 60 minutes. She does tension-style weight training for 45 minutes and finishes with 10 minutes of high-intensity cardio at the end of every workout.

Remember, progress is addictive: I don’t know a person in the world who could continue a workout regime with absolutely no progress. So arm yourself with knowledge and get better results in less time.

‘Push, pull, legs’ is the name of the training split for the movement patterns of that specific muscle group. ‘Push’ refers to all the movements where you use muscles that push the weight away from your body as their primary movement pattern – chest, shoulders and triceps. In ‘pull’, all the exercise is geared at pulling the weight toward your body as the muscles’ primary movement patterns – back, rear delts and biceps. ‘Legs’ refers to lower body-focused leg training.

If you use training as your ‘de-stress’ from work, then evening may be best for you.

Make training a priority, but try to fit it around your lifestyle and not the other way around.

Sets: The number of sets is the number of ‘rounds’ you do. For example, if you do 3 sets of 10 reps, you perform 10 reps of the exercise with a 2:1:2 tempo and then rest for 60 seconds. Repeat for your second and third set.

All the cardio in this program is based on HIIT. HIIT burns more calories, takes less time and works incredibly well to elevate metabolism while burning fat when incorporated into a tension styled program. I personally like using the rowing machine or a stationary bike, but HIIT can be done on any cardio machine.

For HIIT training, set a level that you can sprint as fast as you can for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, reduce the level to a very easy pace and recover for these seconds. Repeat this process 10 times for a total of 10 minutes.

Each workout should take between 40–60 minutes. This program is about quality over quantity. Therefore, bring a stopwatch to time your rest periods, train intensely while in the gym and get out within 60 minutes, so that you don’t start to burn through any hard-earned muscle or overstress your central nervous system.

The entire training program is present below, but if you go to www.briankeanefitness.com you can download the videos that wgo through the entire workout and on how to perform each move correctly.

‘Don’t let your own worst enemy live between your two ears.’.

The first audio book I ever listened to was The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, which changed the way I looked at everything I did in my life.

Charles Duhigg talks about the ‘routine – cue – reward’ system of habits. In order to change a habit, you need to change one of the components of this system. The routine is the actual situation or ‘trigger’ – for me, the routine was coming home every day after work. The cue is what you do next, i.e. getting two or three bars from the cupboard and sitting in the same seat watching the same show. And the reward is serotonin release, the ‘happy hormone’ your brain releases from the chocolate.

For me, the routine of coming home from work was always going to be the same, so I changed the cue. Instead of reaching for chocolate bars in the cupboard, I left a pre-packed gym bag beside the front door. I would come home (routine), pick up my gym bag (new cue) and the reward came via the serotonin release from exercise.

I tried and lived my life by internalizing that there are only three ways to look at most of the things in your life: 1) the things you know; 2) the things you don’t know; and 3) the things you don’t know you don’t know.

I used and still use books, podcasts and following the right people on social media to bridge the gap between all three.

Son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

‘My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life! The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to try to uproot them.’.

There’s a great story in Darren Hardy’s The Compound Effect about a man riding a horse, galloping fast. It appears that’s he’s going somewhere very important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, ‘Where are you going?’ The rider replies, ‘I don’t know. Ask the horse!’.

Psychological studies reveal that 95% of everything we feel, think, do and achieve is a result of a learned habit.

All of the ‘hows’ mean nothing until you find your ‘why’.

I have what I call a ‘non job’ where my life and my job are one and the same.

We all experience emotions like frustration, anger or being overwhelmed and develop a strategy to end these feelings. Some people use food, some use sex, drugs or alcohol. Others use running, going to the gym or reading.

Her journey is her journey, and I have no control over it, but I have control over how much I am present in this journey and how much influence, advice and guidance I can provide to help develop her character along the way.

It might be a comment or a jibe from a friend or a loved one that gives you that spark to get into great shape or a friend who called you stupid that led you to read more books (my why for indulging in reading).

Thus, on days when you’re struggling and want to give up, recall the pain that made you get started and remember your why.

Stress is the figurative ‘death by a thousand cuts’ – you can get everything right with your nutrition, training and supplementation, but if you are in a constant state of fight or flight, stress or anxiety, you are going to struggle to hit your own natural potential.

‘I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most which never happened’.

How about those times when you felt just ‘off’ for no reason other than not feeling right – you just felt on edge, but everything in your life was perfectly fine. This affected me for years until I better understood how certain food ingredients, (additives, flavourings etc.) of certain processed foods had a direct impact on my mood and anxiety levels. If you want to know more about this, take a look at the nutrition section of the book if you’ve not done so yet.

Have you ever wondered why your dog gets happy every single time they see you? Dogs and other animals haven’t developed the part of the brain that allows them to picture the future, so when they see you, they are completely present every single time. They’re not worried about when you will go again, whether they will get food that day or any other scenario that may or may not happen.

Although developing our pre-frontal cortex has allowed us to build civilisations and create things beyond our wildest dreams, the trade off is we can sometimes lack ‘being present’ – or being in the actual moment because we are thinking about the future. Nine out of ten times, it’s normally worrying about something that hasn’t even happened yet – work the next day, paying our bills, etc. This is normally the foundation of anxiety.

‘Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do but you never get anywhere’.

Your brain is like a Rottweiler guard dog – if you mind it, care for it and look after it, it will serve you for life, but if you mistreat it or don’t look after it, it can attack you, harm you and even kill you.

Deep down, most of us want to be accepted and liked by our peers and build positive and thriving relationships with people.

Love the acronym of FEAR: False Evidence Appearing.

I love the acronym of FEAR: False Evidence Appearing Real.

‘Become the person you want to be and then wait for reality to catch up with that version of you’.

My biggest goal in life is to leave the world better than how I had found it, and to instil my life’s philosophy into my daughter so that if she chooses to stand on the shoulders of giants, she has the character and a belief in herself to do it. I want the world to be better because we were here.

Sometimes, we determine our character by what we have or do, and that allows us to become that person. For example, if I have a nice car or a big house, then I will be successful, or if I do well in this show, test or exam, I can become successful. In my opinion, the sequence of actions in that model is wrong. It’s the ‘do, have and be’ model. If I do or have this, I can be that.

As I sat in the car feeling horribly sorry for myself, I looked into my audio book library and re-listened to one of my favourites: Mastery by Robert Greene.

The biggest difference in my life over the last two years, alongside the birth of my daughter, is my ability to take control of my wandering and unhelpful thoughts. Two years ago, if I were left to my own devices, my mind would wander off to the social interaction conversations I had that day, and my life never really changed. I had the same income, the same shape of mind and body, the same network of people I hung around with – nothing ever really progressed.

I know that philosophy helps strengthen my mindset, so I read Seneca or Marcus Aurelius before bed.

I think conflict avoidance is one the biggest detriments to happiness and has been the biggest factor in my own life for dealing with chronic worry. I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head.

I think conflict avoidance is one the biggest detriments to happiness and has been the biggest factor in my own life for dealing with chronic worry. I know that time and again, I’ve figuratively built mountains out of mole hills by avoiding a conversation or a situation that I’ve built up in my own head. I avoided the conversation or the situation because I wanted to avoid the feeling of unease that I knew would inevitably come from it.

Would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself.

I would regularly avoid my inner conflict because of some story I had told myself to justify the situation: ‘Oh I don’t want to hurt this person’s feelings’ or ‘It’s probably not true anyway’, etc. There were times when I just didn’t want to admit that I was too much of a coward to take ownership of a situation.

Now, I like to think of tough words as workouts – all the growth and results come from leaning into the pain of the workout. If you are too comfortable when you work out, your body never really changes. You need to go outside of your comfort zone.

I always try to follow the 10% law: your goals and targets should be so high that even if you only hit 10% of it, you would have still achieved more than 99.9% of what you ever dreamed possible.

‘Aim for the moon, and you will at least hit the stars’ W. CLEMENT STON.

Have three massive whiteboards in my bedroom. One has all my goals for the next 12 months, the other 24 months and the third, the next 10 years.

In every aspect of your life, it’s your choice whether you want to put ‘I’ in front of something (I am angry with those comments, I am annoyed someone would say that, I am disappointed that person used those words). These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself.

These add an extra element, which is ‘you’ in relation to the criticism, rather than the criticism itself. The criticism is not you and you are not the criticism.

Through the readings of Seneca and other stoic philosophers, I can now see from the perspective that sometimes, the criticism or negativity aimed in our direction is actually the other person’s way of consciously or subconsciously dealing with their own demons.

‘Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not the truth’.

When you can truly let go of the thoughts and opinions because that’s all they are, the world will be your oyster. Just ‘do you’ and be happy.

In Yu Dan’s book Confucius From The Heart , he talks about the necessity for benevolent, kind and frugal rulers, the importance of inner moral harmony and its direct connection with harmony in the physical world and how rulers and teachers are important role models for the wider society.

Find the things that make you happy, do more of it. Find the things that make you unhappy, do less of it.

One of my biggest goals in life is to instil the feeling of self-worth and respect into my daughter. I would trade every single thing in my life to make sure my girl grows up with confidence and self-respect.

One of my biggest goals in life is to instil the feeling of self-worth and respect into my daughter. I would trade every single thing in my life to make sure my girl grows up with confidence and self-respect. I truly believe that respecting yourself gives you the confidence to be truly happy in life. How can anybody else respect you if you don’t respect yourself?.
