How we write thus affects how we argue and research, and vice versa.

You’ll discover both how new knowledge depends on what questions you ask and how the way you think about and communicate your research shapes those questions and your answers.

If you are beginning your first project, the task may seem overwhelming: How do I focus on a topic? Where do I find information on it? What do I do when I find it? Even if you’ve done a “research paper” in a writing class, the idea of another may be even more intimidating if this time it’s the real thing. If so, you’re not alone. Even experienced researchers feel anxious when they tackle a new kind of project for a new audience. So whatever anxiety you feel, most researchers have felt it too. The difference is that experienced researchers know what lies ahead—hard work, but also pleasure; some frustration, but more satisfaction; periods of confusion, but confidence that, in the end, it will all come together and that the result is worth the effort.

In fact, they create two kinds of plans: the first helps them prepare and conduct their research; the second helps them draft their paper.

They usually begin with a question and a plan to guide their search for an answer. They may not know exactly what they’ll find, but they know generally what it will look like, even if it surprises them. They also know that once they have an answer, they don’t just start writing, any more than an experienced carpenter just starts sawing. They draw up a second plan, a rough blueprint for a first draft—maybe no more than a sketch of an outline.

Teachers at all levels devote their lives to research. Governments spend billions on it, businesses even more. Research goes on in laboratories and libraries, in jungles and ocean depths, in caves and in outer space, in offices and, in the information age, even in our own homes. Research is in fact the world’s biggest industry. Those who cannot do it well or evaluate that of others will find themselves sidelined in a world increasingly dependent on sound ideas based on good information produced by trustworthy inquiry and then presented clearly and accurately.

Without trustworthy published research, we all would be locked in the opinions of the moment, prisoners of what we alone experience or dupes to whatever we’re told. Of course, we want to believe that our opinions are sound. Yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence.

Without trustworthy published research, we all would be locked in the opinions of the moment, prisoners of what we alone experience or dupes to whatever we’re told. Of course, we want to believe that our opinions are sound. Yet mistaken ideas, even dangerous ones, flourish because too many people accept too many opinions based on too little evidence. And as recent events have shown, those who act on unreliable evidence can lead us—indeed have led us—into disaster.

If you’re preparing to do a research project not because you want to but because it’s been assigned, you might think that it is just make-work and treat it as an empty exercise. We hope you won’t. Done well, your project prepares you to join the oldest and most esteemed of human conversations, one conducted for millennia among philosophers, engineers, biologists, social scientists, historians, literary critics, linguists, theologians, not to mention CEOs, lawyers, marketers, investment managers—the list is endless.

It is no exaggeration to say that, maybe not today or tomorrow but one day, the research you do and the arguments you make using it can improve if not the whole world, then at least your corner of it.

Third reason to write is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you’ll see what you really can think. Just about all of us, students and professionals alike, believe our ideas are more compelling in the dark of our minds than they turn out to be in the cold light of print.

A third reason to write is to get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, where you’ll see what you really can think. Just about all of us, students and professionals alike, believe our ideas are more compelling in the dark of our minds than they turn out to be in the cold light of print.

But the most important reason for learning to write in ways readers expect is that when you write for others, you demand more of yourself than when you write for yourself alone. By the time you fix your ideas in writing, they are so familiar to you that you need help to see them not for what you want them to be but for what they really are. You will understand your own work better when you try to anticipate your readers’ inevitable and critical questions: How have you evaluated your evidence? Why do you think it’s relevant? What ideas have you considered but rejected?.

Some of the world’s most important research has been done by those who persevered in the face of indifference or even hostility, because they never lost faith in their vision. The geneticist Barbara McClintock struggled for years unappreciated because her research community considered her work uninteresting. But she believed in it and pressed on. When her colleagues finally realized that she had already answered questions that they were just starting to ask, she won science’s highest honor, the Nobel Prize.

Interruption of REM sleep has been shown not only to inhibit memory consolidation, especially for declarative memories, but also to significantly impair cognitive processes dependent on working memory function. If you don’t get enough sleep, not only will you struggle to retain facts and concepts, but your working memory function will also be impaired, making it difficult for you to hold information in mind and consequently to understand, think, and learn.

Since few people read formal research papers for entertainment, you have to create a relationship that encourages them to see why it’s in their interest to read yours. That’s not easy. Too many beginning researchers offer readers a relationship that caricatures a bad classroom: Teacher, I know less than you. So my role is to show you how many facts I can dig up. Yours is to say whether I’ve found enough to give me a good grade. Do that and you turn your project into a pointless drill that demeans both you and your teacher. Worse, you cast yourself in a role exactly opposite to that of a true researcher. In true research, you must switch the roles of student and teacher. When you do research, you learn something that others don’t know. So when you report it, you must think of your reader as someone who doesn’t know it but needs to and yourself as someone who will give her reason to want to know it. You must imagine a relationship that goes beyond Here are some facts I’ve dug up about fourteenth-century Tibetan weaving. Are they enough of the right ones?.

You take a step toward more significant research when you can say to readers not just Here are some facts that should interest you, but These facts will help you do something to solve a problem you care about. That is the kind of research that people do every day in business, government, and the professions.

But that research itself was aimed at solving not the practical problem of keeping secrets, but the conceptual problem of not entirely understanding prime numbers. Some researchers call this kind of research “pure” as opposed to “applied.”.

Roles—I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.

You establish your side of the relationship with your readers when you adopt one of those three roles—I have information for you; I can help you fix a problem; I can help you understand something better.

Professionals who expect me to follow every academic convention and use a standard format?.

Help them do something to solve a practical problem in the world?.

Person’s project in this three-part sentence: I’m working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I (and you) can better understand Z.

Early on, each meeting should start with a summary of each person’s project in this three-part sentence: I’m working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I (and you) can better understand Z.

A topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that your readers care about.

Whether traits like shyness or an attraction to risk are learned or genetically inherited. But other questions may intrigue only the researcher:.

Whether traits like shyness or an attraction to risk are learned or genetically inherited. But other questions may intrigue only the researcher: Why do cats rub their faces against us? Why does a coffee spill dry up in the shape of a ring?.

A question raises a problem if not answering it keeps us from knowing something more important than its answer.

Most of us have more than enough interests, but beginners often find it hard to locate among theirs a topic focused enough to support a substantial research project. They may also believe they lack the expertise for the project. However, a research topic is an interest stated specifically enough for you to imagine becoming a local expert on it. That doesn’t mean you already know a lot about it or that you’ll have to know more about it than others, including your teacher. You just want to know a lot more about it than you do now.

Many high school teachers would reward such a paper with a good grade, because it shows that the writer can focus on a topic, find information on it, and assemble that information into a report, no small achievement—for a first project.

If a writer asks no specific question worth asking, he can offer no specific answer worth supporting.

Serious researchers, however, do not document information for its own sake, but to support the answer to a question that they (and they hope their readers) think is worth asking.

So the best way to begin working on your focused topic is not to find all the information you can on it, but to formulate questions that direct you to just that information you need to answer them.

If you are an experienced researcher, look for questions that other researchers ask but don’t answer. Many journal articles end with a paragraph or two about open questions, ideas for more research, and so on (see 4.3.2 for an example). You might not be able to do all the research they suggest, but you might carve out a piece of it. You can also look for Internet discussions on your topic, then “lurk,” just reading the exchanges to understand the kinds of questions those on the list debate. Record questions that spark your interest. You can also post questions to the list if they are specific and narrowly focused.

Some questions that seemed trivial, even silly, have answers more significant than expected. One researcher wondered why a coffee spill dries up in the form of a ring and discovered things about the properties of fluids that others in his field thought important—and that paint manufacturers found valuable. So who knows where a question about cats in the Alamo might take you? You can’t know until you get there.

In our everyday world, a problem is something we try to avoid. But in academic research, a problem is something.

In our everyday world, a problem is something we try to avoid. But in academic research, a problem is something we seek out, even invent if we have to.

As a result, beginners sometimes think that having a topic to read about is the same as having a problem to solve.

We acknowledge a problem only when we stop asking So what? and say, instead, What do we do about it?.

We call research pure when it addresses a conceptual problem that does not bear directly on any practical situation in the world, when it only improves the understanding of a community of researchers. We call research applied when it addresses a conceptual problem that does have practical consequences.

They believe that the pursuit of knowledge “for its own sake” reflects humanity’s highest calling: to know more, not for the sake of money or power, but for the transcendental good of greater understanding and a richer life of the mind. As you may have guessed,.

What distinguishes great researchers from the rest of us is the brilliance, knack, or just dumb luck of stumbling over a problem whose solution makes all of us see the world in a new way.

Nothing discourages a teacher more than a student who does exactly what is suggested and no more.

Teachers want you to use their suggestions to start your thinking, not end it. Nothing makes a teacher happier than when you use her suggestions to find something she never expected.

Disconnected from what some call the “real world.” But in business and government, in law and medicine, in politics and international diplomacy, no skill is valued more highly than the ability to recognize a.

But in business and government, in law and medicine, in politics and international diplomacy, no skill is valued more highly than the ability to recognize a problem, then to articulate it in a way that convinces others both to care about it and to believe it can be solved, especially by you. If you can do that in a class on Byzantine pottery, you can do it in an office on Main Street, Wall Street, or Queen’s Road in Hong Kong.

Keep a journal in which you reflect on your progress. This kind of writing not only helps you understand what you read but stimulates your thinking about it. The more you write early on, no matter how sketchily, the easier it will be to face that intimidating first draft.

Break the task into manageable steps and know that they are mutually supportive. Once you formulate a good question, you’ll draft and revise more effectively. The more you anticipate how you will write and revise a first draft, the more effectively you will produce it.

If you are a student, count on your teachers to understand your struggles. They want you to succeed, and you can expect their help. (If they don’t help, look for others who will.).

But if you have a question and at least one promising answer (the philosopher C. S. Peirce called it a hypothesis on probation), you can start looking for data to test it.

Change your focus and you change the classification of your sources.

The only embarrassing question is the one you failed to ask but should have.

I am working on educational policy in the 1980s 2. to find out how school boards in the Midwest dealt with desegregation, 3. because I want to understand regional differences in race relations.

You might describe your project using the three-step rubric from chapter 3: 1. I am working on educational policy in the 1980s 2. to find out how school boards in the Midwest dealt with desegregation, 3. because I want to understand regional differences in race relations.

Especially valuable at early stages of research are bibliographic works, many of which provide abstracts summarizing significant articles or books on a topic. Look, especially, for annotated bibliographies or annual literature reviews that sum up recent books or articles; these offer the most promising leads for your research.

More important, you’ll miss the benefits of serendipity—a chance encounter with a valuable source that occurs only when a title happens to catch your eye. (All of us have found important sources in this way.) If you can get into.

These practices are not necessarily nefarious, but you should remember that search engine companies and websites themselves have an interest in where you go and what you see online.

I was today years old when I realized that Google search is the start for your quest for information not an end. There is only so much Google can serve us not all much.

In general, don’t use the Internet to find secondary sources, as these depend for their credibility on the checks inherent in the academic publishing system, especially that of peer review.

Be especially careful about sources on hotly contested social issues such as stem-cell research, gun control, and global warming. Many books and articles are published by individuals or organizations driven by ideology. Libraries often include them for the sake of coverage, but don’t assume they are reliable.

Return to this question in chapter 8. Error.

These indicators do not guarantee reliability.

If haven't read the book then what are you even talking about?.

So don’t assume that you can read uncritically just because a report is written by a reputable researcher and published by a reputable press.

Don’t ignore a work on your topic that is not mentioned in the bibliographies of your most relevant sources—you will get credit for originality if you turn up a good source that others have ignored.

Don’t panic if you find a source that seems to pose and solve precisely your problem: “Transforming the Alamo Legend: History in the Service of Politics.” At that moment you might think, I’m dead. Nothing new to say. (It happened to Williams when he was writing his doctoral dissertation and to Colomb just before his first book came out.) You may be right, but probably not. If the source does in fact settle your exact question, you have to formulate a new one. But the question your source asked is probably not as close to yours as you first feared. And you may find that you can do the source one better: if the author failed to get things entirely right, you have an unwitting ally in formulating your problem.

You don’t need to script an interview around a set list of questions—in fact, that can be a bad idea if it makes the interviewee freeze up. But prepare so that you don’t question your source aimlessly. You can always reread a book for what you missed, but you can’t keep going back to people because you didn’t prepare well enough to get what you needed the first time.

Ask them about the important open questions in the field. Ask them what they think of your project or provisional thesis. Ask them to suggest secondary sources for you to read. This kind of personal guidance can be invaluable to a novice researcher, and many experts will be happy to talk with you (or at least engage in a little e-mail correspondence).

People can also lead you to good secondary sources or serve as such sources themselves.

You can also benefit from talking directly with experts on your topic. Ask them about the important open questions in the field. Ask them what they think of your project or provisional thesis.

“I don’t really have a research process; I just ask my smart friends what I should read.”.

Experienced researchers read secondary sources regularly to keep up with work in their fields, and so they usually begin their projects with a question or problem in mind.

First things first: once you decide a source is worth reading, record all of its bibliographical information. Do this before you do anything else: it only takes a moment, and we promise that no habit will serve you better for the rest of your career.

Test your understanding by summarizing: if you can’t sum up a passage in your mind, you.

Test your understanding by summarizing: if you can’t sum up a passage in your mind, you don’t understand it well enough to disagree.

So read sources not randomly but deliberately to find a problem.

You’re more likely to find a research problem when you disagree with a source, but you can also find one in sources you agree with.

Suppose you want to argue that the Alamo legend thrived because it served the political interests of those who created it and satisfied the emotional needs of those who repeated.

However, use statistical data only if you can judge for yourself whether they were collected and analyzed appropriately. (You serve yourself well if you take a course or two in statistics and probability, an area where most Americans are shamefully ignorant.).

(1) what you quote from a source, (2) what you paraphrase or summarize from a source, and (3) your own thoughts. If you are writing on paper, use headings or brackets or different colors of ink to differentiate these different kinds of note. If you are using a computer or taking notes online, use different fonts or different colors of type. We stress that you must unambiguously distinguish your own words from those of your sources because it is so easy to confuse the two.

The main reason some researchers still rely on paper notes is that they help with thinking. Since you can’t write out everything, using paper forces you to think about what’s most important.

Likewise, if your notes are on cards or sheets of paper, you can group them, shuffle them, or lay them out on a desk, a table, or even the floor. And the very act of writing out your notes can help you not only remember what’s in them but also see connections and develop your own ideas.

You can use a full reference-management system. Such systems do much more than help you organize and access your notes. They can often pull information directly from online library catalogs and databases, and they can format and update your citations and bibliographies when you write.

—The quoted words are evidence that backs up your reasons. If, for example, you claimed that different regions responded to the Battle of the Alamo differently, you would quote exact words from different newspapers. You would paraphrase them if you needed only their general sentiments.

—The words are from an authority you plan to rely on or challenge.

—The words are strikingly original or so compelling that the quotation can frame the rest of your discussion.

—The source makes a claim that you disagree with, and to be fair you want to state that claim exactly.

Never abbreviate a quotation thinking you can accurately reconstruct it later. You can’t. And if you misquote, you’ll undermine your credibility.

Students learn to do research well and report it clearly when they take the perspective of their readers and of the community whose values and practices define competent research and its reporting.

They learn to manage an important part of that mental and social process when they understand how a few key formal features of their reports influence how their readers read and judge them.

You can’t wait to plan your argument until after you’ve gathered every last bit of data and found every last relevant source. In the first place, you’ll never get them all. In the second, you’ll end up researching mechanically or aimlessly, accumulating more and more stuff with no sense of what you’ll do with it or following trails of bread crumbs who knows where. Of course, you have to do some research to get a handle on your project. But as soon as you have a sense of your problem and its likely solution, you should begin planning your argument. Your plan will change as your research progresses—if it doesn’t, you probably aren’t doing your best thinking—but making a plan early and modifying it as you go will help you grasp your material better and research more purposefully: only when you try to make a research argument that answers your readers’ predictable questions can you see what research you have yet to do.

For example, a group of physicists once wanted biologists to notice their research but were unhappy when the first manuscript they sent to a biology journal was rejected. So they started attending biology conferences, reading biology journals, even hanging around the biology department’s faculty lounge. After they figured out how biologists think, they rewrote their arguments and published papers that influenced the field.

Here are some facts about my topic; it means explaining your problem and justifying your solution in a research argument.

1. Claim: What do you want me to believe? What’s your point? 2. Reasons: Why do you say that? Why should I agree? 3. Evidence: How do you know? Can you back it up? 4. Acknowledgment and Response: But what about . . . ? 5. Warrant: How does that follow? What’s your logic? Can you explain your reasoning? In fact, you can think of your research as the process of figuring out answers to these questions.

What do higher health costs have to do with hard freezes? I don’t see the connection. To answer, you must offer a general principle that justifies relating your particular reason to your particular claim:.

Being a researcher means allowing yourself to be surprised by your discoveries and insights. So when you start a project, begin not with a claim you know you can prove but with a problem you want to explore and solve.

Ask yourself three questions: 1. What kind of claim should I make? 2. Is it specific enough? 3. Will my readers think it is significant enough to need an argument supporting it?.

If you are new to research, of course, your claim doesn’t have to challenge the experts, just impress your teacher. If you can’t predict whether it will, imagine your reader is someone like yourself. What did you think before you began your research? How much has your claim changed what you now think? What do you understand now that you didn’t before? That’s the best way to prepare for readers who will someday ask you the most devastating question any researcher can face: not Why should I believe this? but Why should I care?.

They want evidence to be accurate, precise, sufficient, representative, and authoritative.

But you can do it throughout your argument as well by anticipating, acknowledging, and responding to questions, objections, and alternatives that your readers are likely to raise along the way.

Don’t go easy on yourself with this one: the time to fix a problem with your argument is when you find it.

A warrant is a principle that connects a reason to a claim. Warrants are important because readers may challenge not just the validity of a reason but its relevance as well.

You know who your readers are, what they know, and why they should care about your problem.

You know the kind of ethos or character you want to project.

You can sketch your question and its answer in two or three sentences.

You can sketch the reasons and evidence supporting your claim. • You know the questions,.

You can sketch the reasons and evidence supporting your claim.

You know the questions, alternatives, and objections that your readers are likely to raise, and you can respond to them.

You know when your readers may not see the relevance of a reason to a claim and can state the warrant that connects them.

Research is like gold mining: dig up a lot, pick out a little, toss the rest.

Ernest Hemingway said that you know you’re writing well when you discard stuff you know is good—but not as good as what you keep.

Readers want your analysis, not a summary of your sources. Beginning researchers go wrong when they string together quotations, summaries, and loose paraphrases of sources into a patchwork that reflects little of their own thinking. Such “patch writing” invites the charge This is all summary, no analysis. It is a particular risk if you do most of your research online, because it is so easy to cut-and-paste from your sources. Experienced readers recognize patch writing, and you risk a charge of plagiarism (see 14.6).

Advanced researchers rarely offer patchwork summaries, but they can follow sources too closely in another way: they map their paper on to the organization of a major source rather than create a new one that serves their argument better. If the key terms that run through your paper are the same as those in one or more sources, consider whether you are making.

Advanced researchers rarely offer patchwork summaries, but they can follow sources too closely in another way: they map their paper on to the organization of a major source rather than create a new one that serves their argument better. If the key terms that run through your paper are the same as those in one or more sources, consider whether you are making your own argument or mimicking theirs.

Research’s most exciting moments: we discover ideas that we didn’t have until we expressed them. But like other steps in the process, even surprises happen better with a plan.

You feel so intimidated by the task that you don’t know where to begin. If so, divide the process into small tasks; then focus on one step at a time. • You have set no goals or goals that are too high. If so, create a routine that sets goals you can meet, then use devices such as a progress chart or regular meetings with a writing partner. • You feel you must make every sentence or paragraph perfect before you move to the next one. You can avoid some obsession with perfection if you write informally along the way, telling yourself you are writing only to help you think on paper. In any event, know that every researcher compromises on perfection to get the job done.

To avoid seeming to plagiarize, read the passage, look away, think about it for a moment; then still looking away, paraphrase it in your own words. Then check whether you can run your finger along your sentence and find synonyms for the same ideas in the same order in your source. If you can, try again.

The time you spend revising your introduction and conclusion may be the most important revision you do.

As we’ve said, you can always work with readers who say, I don’t agree. What you can’t survive are those who shrug and say, I don’t care.

Our suggestion: state costs or consequences when presenting your problem; state benefits to intensify your solution.

Readers will accept your claim only if they understand your argument, but they won’t understand your argument if they can’t understand your sentences.

So here are two principles of a clear style: • Express crucial actions in verbs. • Make your central characters the subjects of those verbs; keep those subjects short, concrete, and specific.
