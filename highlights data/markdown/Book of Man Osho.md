Priests and politicians have caused a tremendous split in man. They have created a guilt-ridden man who is alienated from himself, fighting a permanent inner conflict which pervades all areas of his life—a conflict between body and soul, matter and mind, materialism and spiritualism, science and religion, man and woman, West and East . ..

Life can be lived in two ways: either as calculation—in science, technology, mathematics, economics—or as poetry—in art, music, beauty, love.

He loses access to his innate feminine qualities of feeling, gentleness, love and intuition and becomes a head-oriented, efficient, unfeeling robot.

Society teaches man to become a ‘strong man’ which is synonymous with suppressing his feminine qualities of softness and receptivity, love and compassion. But every man has an ‘inner woman’ inside—his own unconscious or semi-conscious female part, which has been denied and suppressed for thousands of years.

‘No man is just man and no woman is just woman; each man is both man and woman, and so is each woman—woman and man.

‘My vision of the new man is of a rebel, of a man who is in search of his original self, of his original face. A man who is ready to drop all masks, all pretensions, all hypocrisies, and show to the world what he, in reality, is. Whether he is loved or condemned, respected, honoured or dishonoured, crowned or crucified, does not matter; because to be yourself is the greatest blessing in existence. Even if you are crucified, you will be crucified fulfilled and immensely contented. A man of truth, a man of sincerity, a man who knows love and who knows compassion, and who understands that people are blind, unconscious, asleep, spiritually asleep.’.

Everybody is coming out with a mask which is smiling, happy looking, so everybody is deceiving everybody else.

Even friends, even lovers keep one another at a distance: too much closeness will be dangerous, they may see your reality.

Nature has no idea of money, otherwise dollars would have been growing on trees.

Just be yourself, then there is no misery, no competition and no botheration that others have more, that you don’t have more.

The world is against individuality. It is against your being just your natural self.

You were born an emperor, utterly contented within yourself. But your father wants you to love him, your mother wants you to love her. Everybody around you wants to become an object of your love. Nobody bothers that a man who cannot love himself cannot love anybody else either. So a very mad society is created where everybody is trying to love somebody.

A rightly brought up child will be allowed to grow in love towards himself so that he becomes so full of love that sharing becomes a necessity.

You are the giver; the giver is never a beggar.

‘I am to love myself; otherwise, I will miss the meaning of life. I will never grow up, I will simply grow old. I will not have any individuality. I will not be truly human, dignified, integrated.’.

In Japan, they have 400-year-old trees, but their height is only 6 inches. They think that it is a form of art. It is murder, sheer murder! The tree looks ancient, but is only 6 inches high. It would have been 100 feet high, reaching towards the stars. What have they done? What strategy have they used? The same strategy has been used against humanity, human beings. They put the tree in a pot which has no bottom. So whenever the tree grows its roots, they go on cutting them, because there is no bottom to the pot. The roots they go on cutting, and unless roots grow deeper, the tree cannot rise higher. It grows old, but it never grows up. Exactly the same has been done with human beings.

The people of the United States were killing innocent, poor people in Vietnam. What business was it of theirs? And it was not one-sided. They were sending their own, who have not tasted anything of life, to kill and to be killed in the name of democracy, in the name of America. But why should one sacrifice oneself in any name? Mohammedans and Christians have been fighting, killing each other, in the name of God. Both are struggling with one another in the same name—God. A strange world we have created! But the strategy is very simple: destroy the person’s natural love for himself. Then he is so unworthy in his own eyes, he is ready to do anything for a gold medal, just to feel a little worth—that he is also somebody. Do you see on your generals many coloured stripes? What kind of stupidity is this? Those stripes go on growing as the general goes on killing himself, destroying himself.

But you can accept responsibility only when you have tremendous love for yourself.

‘One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I would rather suffer for the entire eternity in hellfire, but I will remain myself. At least that much joy I will have—that this is my choice, nobody has forced me.’.

‘One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I would rather suffer for the entire eternity in hellfire, but I will remain myself. At least that much joy I will have—.

You just need to trust yourself; that is another name for loving yourself. And when you trust and love yourself, obviously, you have taken all the responsibility of whatever you are, whoever you are, upon your shoulders. That gives such a tremendous experience of being that nobody can enslave you again.

‘That’s what I want to know. Life, I have known. It was beautiful; with all its anxieties, anguishes, still it was a joy. Just to breathe is joy enough. I have lived, I have loved; I have done whatever I wanted to do, I have said whatever I wanted to say. Now I want to taste death—and the sooner the better.

‘There are only two possibilities: either my soul will go on living in other forms as the Eastern mystics say—that is a great excitement, to go on that journey of the soul free from the burden of the body. The body is a cage, it has limitations. Or perhaps the materialists are right, that when your body dies, everything dies. Nobody remains afterwards. That too, is a great excitement—not to be! I know what it means to be, and the moment has come to find out what it means not to be. And when I am no more, what is the problem? Why should I be worried about it? I will not be there to worry, so why waste time now?’.

‘And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am responsible. I knew that it was going to happen because to talk about truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask for death.

‘And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am responsible. I knew that it was going to happen because to talk about truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask for death. Don’t blame these poor people who have decided my death. If anybody is responsible, I am. And I want you all to know that I lived taking responsibility for myself and I am dying taking responsibility for myself. Living, I was an individual. Dying, I am an individual. Nobody decides for me; I am decisive about myself.’.

Be yourself, just yourself, simply yourself. And, remember, you are taking a great risk when you declare that you are simply yourself. You don’t belong to any crowd, any herd. These are all herds: Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, Communists. You are declaring yourself an individual, knowing perfectly well that it is risky. The crowd may not forgive you at all. But it is so beautiful to take the risk, to move on the razor’s edge where every step is dangerous.

Don’t want you to be a businessman, I want you to be a gambler. And when you are gambling, put everything at stake. Don’t save anything for the next moment. Then whatever happens will bring great blessing to you. Even if you become a beggar, your being will be far more dignified than that of an emperor.

Once a man falls in love with rebellion, he is on the right path.

And it has enforced those ideals so deeply in you that you are always interested in the ideal, ‘how I should be’ and you have forgotten who you are.

Neither does the rose ever try to become a lotus, nor does the lotus ever try to become a rose.

Live moment to moment, with tremendous acceptance, without creating any division, and you are on the way towards self-knowledge.

It is not really sadness that gives you pain. It is the interpretation that sadness is wrong that gives you pain, and that becomes a psychological problem. It is not anger that is painful; it is the idea that anger is wrong that creates psychological anxiety. It is the interpretation, not the fact. The fact is always liberating.

Repression is to live a life that you were not meant to live. Repression is to do things which you never wanted to do. Repression is to be the fellow that you are not. Repression is a way to destroy yourself. Repression is suicide—very slow, of course, but a very certain, slow poisoning. Expression is life; repression is suicide.

Society has played a great game—it has put everybody against himself. So you are continuously fighting within yourself.

Continuously fighting. Society has divided you into a split person: it has made you schizophrenic and it has confused you.

Cannot give you God, I cannot give you truth, I cannot give you your inner core, but I can take all the rubbish that has been heaped upon.

I cannot give you God, I cannot give you truth, I cannot give you your inner core, but I can take all the rubbish that has been heaped upon you.

The problem becomes more complicated because the people he has to protect himself against are the people who think that they love him.

He has to fight against those whom he loves, and he thinks they love him too.

‘We will love you, we do love you, but only if you follow the way we are following, if you follow the religion we are following, if you become obedient the way we are obedient.’.

Disobedience is the foundation of a real religious man—disobedience to all priests, to all politicians, to all vested interests.

Love your children, but never hope through them.

Love your children as much as you can and give them a feeling that they are loved for themselves and not for any other use that they can be of.

Love your children tremendously and give them a feeling that they are accepted as they are.

He needs the mother, that’s one thing, he uses the mother, that’s one thing, but there is no law of nature that he should love the mother. He likes her because she is so helpful, so useful; without her, he cannot exist. So he is grateful, respectful—all these things are okay—but love is a totally different phenomenon.

And it is very simple because the child’s love will flow towards his own child, it cannot go backwards—just as the Ganges goes on flowing towards the ocean, not towards the source.

You fall in love with the colour of the hair—now, what has that to do with love? After two days, you will not look at the colour of the hair at all.

So, remember, that love for the mother has to be more like respect, less like love. Love towards your mother has to be more of the quality of gratefulness, respect, deep respect.

Man is a machine, that’s why. Man, as he is, is utterly unconscious. He is nothing but his habits, the sum total of his habits.

Reaction comes out of the past, responses come out of the present moment. Response is spontaneous, reaction is just old habit.

You are feeling nervous and you take out your cigarette and you start smoking. It is a reaction; whenever you have felt nervous, you have done it.

Somebody would come who had always been a vegetarian, and he would say, ‘Eat meat.’ Now, it is the same fundamental—this man is just a little too much of himself, a little eccentric. He would say, ‘Eat meat.’ Now, watch a vegetarian eating meat. The whole body wants to throw it out and he wants to vomit, and the whole mind is puzzled and disturbed and he starts perspiring, because the mind has no way to cope with it.

The politician means the desire to dominate, the desire to be number one. The politician means ambition, the ambitious mind.

Watch, become alert, observe, and go on dropping all the reactive patterns in you. Each moment try to respond to the reality—not according to the ready-made idea in you but according to the reality as it is there outside. Respond to the reality! Respond with your total consciousness but not with your mind.

A dog is a dog: he remains a dog. He is born a dog and will die a dog. A man can become a Buddha, and can become an Adolf Hitler too. So man is very open-ended on both sides—he can fall back.

All over nature, it is the male who attracts the female. And for that reason, all over nature, the male is more beautiful—because the female need not have any beauty; just being female is enough. But strange—man has been standing on his head continuously. It is the male who should be more beautiful so that a female is attracted towards him.

Celebration is the highest growth of consciousness. I teach you celebration. Celebration is my key.

The man continuously fights in the world so his male energy is exhausted. By the time he comes home, he wants to become feminine. He wants to rest from his male aggression. In the office, in the factory, in the marketplace, in politics—everywhere he has been fighting and fighting. At home, he does not want to fight, he wants to rest, because tomorrow again the world will start.

The whole day the woman has been feminine, not fighting at all; there was nobody to fight with. She is tired of being a woman . . . and the kitchen and everything and the children. She wants to enjoy a little bit of aggression and fight and nagging, and the poor husband is available. So she becomes male and the husband becomes female; that is the whole foundation of henpeckedness.

Men are better friends, remember; man and woman are never friends. Lovers are enemies but never friends; in fact, lovers and enemies, never friends. Men are very good friends; women don’t know how to be friendly. It is very difficult for women to love other women; they know each other too well—in fact they know too much about each other. But men are very friendly and homosexuals are really gay people, because there is no agony . . . but there is no ecstasy either. One has to risk and pay.

Man is aware deep down that woman has something which he does not have. In the first place, the woman is attractive to him, she looks beautiful. He falls in love with the woman, the woman becomes almost an addiction to him—and that’s where the trouble arises. The feeling of dependence on woman, which every man feels, makes him react in such a way that he tries to manage the woman as a slave—spiritually a slave. He is also afraid because she is beautiful. She is beautiful not only to him: she is beautiful to whomever looks at her, to whomever comes in contact with her. Great jealousy arises in the egoist, male chauvinist mind. He has done with women what Machiavelli suggests to politicians—marriage is politics too. Machiavelli suggests that the best way of defence is offense, and man has used the idea for centuries—centuries before Machiavelli recognized it as a basic fact in all political spheres. Wherever there is some kind of domination, offense is certainly the best way of defence. In defence, you are already losing ground; you have already accepted yourself as the defeated side. You are just protecting yourself.

In India, there are religious scriptures like Manu Smriti, 5,000 years old, and they suggest that if you want to have peace in your house, giving a good beating to the woman once in a while is absolutely necessary.

In India, there are religious scriptures like Manu Smriti, 5,000 years old, and they suggest that if you want to have peace in your house, giving a good beating to the woman once in a while is absolutely necessary. She should be kept almost imprisoned. And that’s how she has lived—in different cultures, different countries, but her imprisonment has been almost the same.

A real superiority needs no proof, no evidence, no witness, no argument. A real superiority is immediately recognized by anybody who has even a small amount of intelligence. The real superiority has its own magnetic force.

Only in one thing is he stronger and that is he has a muscular body. He is a good manual worker. Otherwise, on every point he feels—and he has felt for centuries—a deep inferiority complex. To avoid that complex, the only way is to force woman into an inferior position. And that is the only thing that is more powerful in man: he can force woman. He is more cruel, he is more violent, and he has forced woman to accept an idea which is absolutely false: that she is weak. And to prove that woman is weak, he has to condemn all the feminine qualities. He has to say that they are all weak, and all those qualities together make woman weak.

The traits that are thought to be weak are all the feminine ones.

The delicate woman, the fragile woman, jumps into the funeral pyre and the stronger Mohammed Ali goes on doing his push-ups. And he is still stronger!.

The greatest problem has been that woman is capable of becoming a mother; she is capable of giving birth to life, and man is not. That was the beginning of the feeling of inferiority—that nature depends on woman, not on man.

Women are women, men are men; they have differences, but differences don’t make anybody higher or lower. Their differences create their attraction. Just think of a world where there are only men. It will be so ugly. Life is rich because there are differences, different attitudes, different opinions. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior. People are simply different.

Why do men have hair on their chests? Well, they can’t have everything!.

IT IS ONE of the human weaknesses, one of the deep-rooted frailties, to seek attention. The reason one seeks attention is because one does not know oneself. It is only in other people’s eyes can one see his face, in their opinions, he can find his personality. What they say matters immensely. If they neglect him, ignore him, he feels lost.

And the situation cannot change until you discover your authentic self—which does not depend on anybody’s opinion, attention, criticism, indifference, which does not have anything to do with anybody else.

Even if people condemn you, criticize you, are against you, that is acceptable; at least they are paying attention to you.

Once you know yourself, you don’t care about others. Even if the whole world forgets you, it does not matter, it does not even make the slightest difference to you; or the whole world can know—that too does not give you any ego.

You are emperors, but you have to discover yourself. And this discovery is not difficult: your kingdom is within you. You just have to learn to close your eyes and look inwards. A little discipline, a little learning not to remain focused on the outside continuously, but to turn inwards at least once or twice a day, whenever you can find time . . . Slowly, slowly you start becoming aware of your eternal being. Then the idea of attention simply disappears. And the miracle is: the day you don’t need anybody’s attention, people start feeling your charisma, because charisma is the radiation of your individuality. They start feeling that you are somebody special, unique—although they cannot pinpoint where your uniqueness is, what it is that attracts like a magnet.

And do you think, if you are divorced, you will not again choose another woman of the same type? If you ask psychologists, they will say you will again choose the same type of woman. You needed it; it is your own choice. You cannot live without misery. You think your wife is creating misery? It is because you wanted to live in misery—that’s why you have chosen this woman. You will again choose the same type of woman. You will only become attracted to the same type of woman unless you drop your old mind completely.

There are two things necessary to keep one’s wife happy. First: let her think she is having her own way. And second: let her have it.

Would love a world where the family is replaced by the commune. Psychologically, it is more healthy to have a commune, where children are not possessed by the parents, they belong to the commune; where children are not given the imprint of the mother and father only, they have many uncles in the commune, many aunts in the commune. Sometimes they sleep with this family, sometimes with that family. I want the family to be replaced by the commune, and in a commune, there is no need for marriage.

For the man who cannot live with himself, the other is a need, an absolute need, because whenever he is alone, he is bored with himself—so bored that he wants some occupation with somebody else. Because it is a need, it becomes a dependence, you have to depend on the other. And because it becomes a dependence, you hate, you rebel, you resist, because it is a slavery. Dependence is a kind of slavery, and nobody wants to be a slave.

You meet a woman—you are not able to live alone. The woman is also not able to live alone, that’s why she is meeting you; otherwise there is no need. Both are bored with themselves and both are thinking that the other will help to get rid of the boredom. Yes, in the beginning, it looks like that, but only in the beginning.

That’s why if you see a bored couple walking by, you can be certain they are married. If they are not bored, you can be certain they are not married. The man must be walking with somebody else’s wife, that’s why there is so much joy.

‘Who knows, I may come out of my boredom, my anguish, my anxiety, my aloneness. This woman may help me.’.

Because you are not meditative, you need others to keep you occupied. And because you are not meditative, you are not able to love either, because love is an overflowing joy. You are bored with yourself; what have you got to share with the other? Hence, being with the other also becomes hell.

One psychoanalyst met another psychoanalyst on the street. The first one said to the other, ‘You look fine. How am I?’.

Nobody knows about himself, nobody is acquainted with himself. We only see the faces of others. A woman looks beautiful, a man looks beautiful, smiling, all smiles. We don’t know his anguish. Maybe all those smiles are just a facade to deceive others and to deceive himself. Maybe behind those smiles there are great tears. Maybe he is afraid if he does not smile, he may start weeping and crying. When you see the other, you simply see the surface, you fall in love with the surface. But when you come closer, you soon know that the inner depths of the other person are as dark as your own. He is a beggar just as you are. Now . . . two beggars begging from each other.

Nobody can guarantee that two persons will always be happy together, because people change. When you meet a woman, she is one person, you are one person. After ten years, you will be another person, she will be another person. It is like a river: the water is continuously flowing. The people who had fallen in love are no longer there, both are no longer there. Now you can go on clinging to a certain promise given by somebody else—but you had not given it.

A real man of understanding never promises for tomorrow, he can only say, ‘For the moment.’ A really sincere man cannot promise at all. How can he promise? Who knows about tomorrow? Tomorrow may come, may not come. Tomorrow may come, ‘I will not be the same, you will not be the same.’ Tomorrow may come, ‘You may find somebody with whom you fit more deeply, I may find somebody whom I go with more harmoniously.’ The world is vast. Why exhaust it today? Keep doors open, keep alternatives open.

‘What has happened to Jack? I have not seen him for ages.’ ‘Oh, he married the girl he rescued from drowning.’ ‘And is he happy?’ ‘You bet! But he hates water now.’.

The need is because every man has a feminine part in his being, and every woman has a masculine part in her being. The only way to understand it, the easiest way to understand it, the most natural way to understand it is to be in deep, intimate relationship with someone. If you are a man, be in a deep, intimate relationship with a woman. Let trust grow so all barriers dissolve. Come so close to each other that you can look deep into the woman and the woman can look deep into you. Don’t be dishonest with each other.

You fall in love with a woman because she is so new: the physiology, the proportions of her body, the face, the eyes, the eyebrows, the colour of her hair, the way she walks, the way she turns, the way she says hello, the way she looks. Everything is new, the whole territory unknown: you would like to investigate this territory. It is inviting, it is very inviting; you are caught, hypnotized. And when you start approaching, she starts to run away; that is part of the game. The more she runs, the more enchanting she becomes. If she simply says, ‘Yes, I am ready,’ half of the enthusiasm will be dead that very moment. In fact, you will start thinking how to run away. So, she gives you a chance to chase her. People are never as happy as while the courting continues—very happy—because it is a chase. Man is basically a hunter, so when the woman is chased, running away, trying to hide here and there, avoiding, saying no, the man gets more and more hot. The challenge becomes intense; the woman has to be conquered. Now he is ready to die for her, or do whatsoever is needed, but the woman has to be conquered. He has to prove that he is no ordinary man.

The world remains the same sorry-go-round!.

The politician has no consciousness; in fact, he is trying to avoid his inner problems, he is trying to escape from his own problems. And the easiest way to do so is to become concerned about world problems, economics, politics, history, service to the poor, transformation of the conditions of society, reformation.

And the easiest way to do so is to become concerned about world problems, economics, politics, history, service to the poor, transformation of the conditions of society, reformation. All these are strategies for escaping from one’s own problems—subtle strategies, dangerous, because one feels that one is doing something great, while one is simply being a coward.

There are three ways to be ruined in this world: first is by sex, second is by gambling, and the third is by politics. Sex.

There are three ways to be ruined in this world: first is by sex, second is by gambling, and the third is by politics.

Second, remember the fundamental law of all revolutions: when the revolution comes, things will be different—not better, just different.

That religion has proved to be the opium of the people.

Hindus believe in the Vedas and believe that they are written by God himself—they are the most ancient books in existence but no Hindu bothers to look into them. If God wrote them, there is going to be something immensely valuable, but 98 per cent of the Vedas are just rubbish—such rubbish that it proves that they are not written by God.

These are ways of livelihood, these are ways of getting bread and butter, a shelter.

They can’t change your inner being.

Carpenter’s son can become a buddha, why not you? Kabir was a weaver. He continued his work for his whole life; even.

When you close your shop, forget all about your business. When you come home, don’t carry the shop in your head. When you are home with your wife, with your children, don’t be a businessman. That is ugly: that means your being is becoming.

When you close your shop, forget all about your business. When you come home, don’t carry the shop in your head. When you are home with your wife, with your children, don’t be a businessman. That is ugly: that means your being is becoming coloured by your doing.

The being should remain transcendental to your doing and you should always be capable of putting your doing aside and entering into the world of your being.

Rosenfeld walked into the house with a grin on his face. ‘You will never guess what a bargain I just got,’ he told his wife. ‘I bought four polyester, steel-belted, radial wide-tread, white-walled, heavy-duty tyres, on sale!’ ‘Are you nuts?’ said Mistress Rosenfeld. ‘What did you buy tyres for? You don’t even have a car.’ ‘So,’ said Rosenfeld, ‘you buy brassieres, don’t you?’.

You simply show your money. So whatsoever is costly becomes significant, whatsoever is costly is thought to be significant.

‘I am no longer concerned with what others are doing, I am only concerned with what I am. I am not concerned with what others have, I am only concerned with what I have.’.

Have you watched a child just running, shouting, dancing for nothing at all?—because he has nothing. If you ask him, ‘Why are you so happy?’ he will not be able to answer you. He will really think that you are mad. Is there any need for any cause to be happy? He will simply be shocked that the ‘why’ can be raised. He will shrug his shoulders and will go on his way and start singing and dancing again. The child has nothing. He is not a prime minister yet, he is not a president of the United States, he is not a Rockefeller. He owns nothing—maybe a few shells or a few stones that he has collected on the seashore, that’s all.

On the one hand, there is fear that you may miss and others may attain, and, on the other, a deep apprehension that even if you get what you are after, nothing is got. Even if you arrive, you arrive nowhere because death comes and destroys everything.

The most important thing that happened to the first man who walked on the moon was that he suddenly forgot that he was an American. Suddenly, the whole earth was one, there were no boundaries, because there is no map on earth. The American continent, the African continent, the Asian continent, this country and that country all disappeared.

A free man belongs to himself and nobody else. A free man is simply an energy with no name, no form, no race, no nation. The days of nations and races are past, the days of the individual are coming. In a better world, there will be no Germans, no Indians, no Hindus, no Christians—there will be pure individuals, perfectly free, living their life in their own way, not disturbing anybody’s life and not allowing anybody to disturb their lives.

Is very difficult, specially for the Western mind, to understand that life is purposeless. The West has been thinking in terms of purpose, but the East is considering in terms of purposelessness. The East says life is not a business, it is a play, and a play has no purpose really; it is non-purposeful. Or you can say play is its own purpose, to play is enough. Life is not reaching towards some goal, life itself is the goal. It is not evolving into some ultimate;.

Life is not reaching towards some goal, life itself is the goal. It is not evolving into some ultimate; this very moment, here and now, life is ultimate.

Pornography exists because of the priests, not because of the ‘Playboys.’ In fact, the Playboys are only by-products of the priests. So much pornography exists simply because so much sex has been repressed; it wants to find some way, some outlet.

Killing arises only if sex is very repressed. It is a strange fact that whenever a society has been affluent, rich, sexually free, it was destroyed by poor, backward, repressive societies. That was the fate of Greek civilization, that was the fate of Roman civilization, that was the fate of Hindu civilization, and that is going to be the fate of American culture. It is very strange that the further evolved a society is, the more it is vulnerable to being destroyed easily by the less evolved, because the less evolved are more repressive. They are more foolish, they are more stupid; they still go on listening to the priests.

Have you observed that you get angry only with those people who are very intimate with you? The more the intimacy, the more the anger. Why? The greater the gap between you and the person, the less the anger that will be there. You do not get angry with a stranger. You get angry with your wife, with your husband, with your son, with your daughter, with your mother. Why? Why do you get more angry with persons who are more intimate with you? The reason is this: you are angry with yourself. The more intimate a person is with you, the more he has become identified with you.

‘Whosoever clings to life, whosoever tries to preserve it, will lose it; and whosoever is ready to lose it, will preserve it.’.

The greatest warrior has nothing to do with war. He has nothing to do with fighting others. He has something to do inside himself. And it is not a fight, although it brings victory; it is not a war, not a conflict. But one has to be a warrior because one has to be very alert just like a warrior.

There are only two types of people in the world. People who want to live comfortably . . . . They are seeking death; they want a comfortable grave. And people who want to live. They choose to live dangerously, because life thrives only when there is risk. Have you ever gone climbing the mountains? The higher the climb, the fresher you feel, the younger you feel. The greater the danger of falling, the bigger the abyss by the side, the more alive you are . . . between life and death, when you are just hanging between life and death. Then there is no boredom, then there is no dust of the past, no desire for the future.

Then there is no boredom, then there is no dust of the past, no desire for the future. Then the present moment is very sharp, like a flame. It is enough. You live in the here and now . . . Or surfing or skiing or gliding: wherever there is a risk of losing life, there is tremendous joy because the risk of losing life makes you tremendously alive. Hence, people are attracted to dangerous sports.

People go climbing mountains. Somebody asked Hillary, ‘Why did you try to climb Everest? Why?’ And he said, ‘Because it is there—a constant challenge.’ It was risky, many people had died before. For almost sixty, seventy years, groups had been going, and it was almost a certain death. But still people were going. What was the attraction?.

And don’t make your tomorrow predictable. Expect nothing and be ready for everything. That’s what I mean when I say live dangerously.

I’m not saying don’t get married. It is a formality. Good, satisfy the society. But deep in your mind never possess the woman. Never for a single moment say, ‘You belong to me’—because how can a person belong to you? And when you start possessing the woman, she will start possessing you. Then you both are no longer in love. You are just crushing and killing each other, paralysing each other.

Love—but don’t degrade your love through marriage. Work—work is needed—but don’t let work become your only life.

Risk is the only guarantee for being truly alive.

THE BOHEMIAN LIFE is the only life worth living! All other kinds of lives are only lukewarm; they are more ways of committing slow suicide than ways of living life passionately and intensely.

You can be creative only if you are an individual, you cannot create as a part of the mob psychology. The mob psychology is uncreative; it lives a life that is more a drag. It knows no dance, no song, no joy; it is mechanical.

The creator cannot follow the well-trodden path. He has to search and find out his own way.

He has to inquire in the jungles of life, he has to go alone, he has to be a dropout from the mob mind, from the collective psychology.

The collective mind is the lowest mind in the world; even the so-called idiots are a little more superior than the collective idiocy.

But collectivity has its own bribes: it respects people, honours people, if they go on insisting that the way of the collective mind is the only right way.

Discipline is a beautiful word, but it has been misused as all other beautiful words have been misused in the past. The word discipline comes from the same root as the word disciple; the root meaning of the word is a process of learning. One who is ready to learn is a disciple, and the process of being ready to learn is discipline.

Know only one thing, that I know nothing.’.

‘I know only one thing, that I know nothing.’.

One thing may be right this moment and may become wrong the next moment. Don’t try to be consistent, otherwise you will be dead. Only dead people are consistent.

Try to be alive, with all its inconsistencies, and live each moment without any reference to the past, without any reference to the future either. Live the moment in the context of the moment, and your response will be total. And that totality has beauty and that totality is creativity. Then whatsoever you do will have a beauty of its own.

A PERSON CAN either grow old or grow up. The person who only grows old has not lived at all. He has passed time, but he has not lived. All his life is nothing but repression. I teach you not to grow old. That does not mean you will not become old, it means I give you another dimension: growing.

There is no lust in his love, no desire, he wants to get nothing out of it. His love has a purity, an innocence; his love is a joy.

The old man knows that those childish desires were really childish. He knows that all those days of youth and turmoil are gone. He is in the same state as when the storm has gone and silence prevails. That silence can be of tremendous beauty, depth, richness. If the old man is really mature, which is very rarely the case, he will be beautiful. But people only grow in age, they don’t grow up. Hence the problem.

The eastern word for master is acharya. The word acharya means one who lives his life authentically, according to his own consciousness and awareness.

Being with him, you will learn only one thing: how to live in freedom, awareness, in deep integrity and dignity.

Think of two candles, one lit and one unlit, coming closer and closer. A moment comes when you will be suddenly amazed—both candles are lit. The flame has jumped to the other candle. Just a certain proximity.

Think of two candles, one lit and one unlit, coming closer and closer. A moment comes when you will be suddenly amazed—both candles are lit. The flame has jumped to the other candle. Just a certain proximity . . . . Love creates that proximity, and the flame jumps from one heart to another heart. There is no question of anybody surrendering, there is no question of anybody believing.

He may be against one culture, but he is immediately ready for another culture.

The rebel simply moves out of the past and never allows the past to dominate him. It is a constant, continuous process. The whole life of the rebel is a fire that burns. To the very last breath, he is fresh, he is young. He will not respond to any situation according to his past experience; he will respond to every situation according to his present consciousness. To be a rebel, to me, is the only way to be religious,.

The rebel simply moves out of the past and never allows the past to dominate him. It is a constant, continuous process. The whole life of the rebel is a fire that burns. To the very last breath, he is fresh, he is young. He will not respond to any situation according to his past experience; he will respond to every situation according to his present consciousness.

Although he goes against society, just to be against society is not necessarily to be right. In fact, most of the time to move from one extreme to another is always to move from one wrong to another wrong.

‘Now I will decide each time whether to be obedient or not. I will not have a fixed philosophy but I will move according to the situation—because you have been cunning with me, you have been cheating me. I’m your son and still you have been cheating me! You have been ordering me in such a way that I should disobey. From today onwards, be alert—I may obey, I may not. I am not going to be predictable, controllable, in your hands anymore.’.
