Oddly, the same Government of India waved a different wand at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. And that was less than nine months before it found a fall in poverty in the country. At that summit, it presented a document saying 39.9 per cent of Indians were below the poverty line. It was, after all, begging for money from donors. The more the poor, the more the money. At home, less than 300 days later, it produced the 19 per cent estimate. (Those intrigued by the mysteries of the official poverty line can look at Appendix 1 at the back of the book.).

But I did want to escape what Swami Vivekananda once described as the propensity of the Indian elite to discuss for hours whether a glass of water ought to be taken with the left hand or the right hand. So the focus remains on people and their problems.

These were Ramnad and Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, Godda and Palamau in Bihar, Malkangiri and Nuapada in Orissa and Surguja and Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh.

These projects are just started for the money they bring, not for the Korwas or anyone else.’.

‘If the money were simply put into bank fixed deposits, none of these families would ever have to work again. The interest alone would make them very well off by Surguja’s standards.’.

In 1992, USAID gave India US $ 325 million (Rs. 800 crores) to be spent solely on population control in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This programme has serious implications. One is that hazardous contraceptives like Norplant will be pushed onto very poof rural women who have little or no access to proper health care. The same contraceptives are not in general use in any Western country.

Yet, every third human being in the world without safe and adequate water supply is an Indian.

Every fourth child on the globe who dies of diarrhoea is an Indian.

Every third person in the world with leprosy is an Indian.

Every fourth being on the planet dying of water-borne or water-related diseases is an Indian.

Of the over sixteen million tuberculosis cases that exist at any time world-wide, 12.7 million are in India.

Every third person in the world with leprosy is an Indian. Every fourth being on the planet dying of water-borne or water-related diseases is an Indian. Of the over sixteen million tuberculosis cases that exist at any time world-wide, 12.7 million are in India. Tens of millions of Indians suffer from malnutrition. It lays their systems open to an array of fatal ailments. Yet, official expenditure on.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health.

Never in history have Indian governments spent more than 1.8 per cent of GDP on health. The current figure of public spending is 1.3 per cent of GDP. Nicaragua spends 6.7, Brazil 2.8 and China 2.1 per cent. Among the advanced industrial nations, Sweden spends 7.9 and the United States 5.6 per cent.

Only 20 per cent of hospital beds are in rural areas where 80 per cent of Indians live.

More than a few doctors, having been trained at the expense of the poorest people in the world, settle abroad to address the ailments of affluent Americans. So some of the most deprived, disease-ridden people subsidise the health of the richest.

Lack of resources has little to do with it. Maharashtra and Gujarat are the two states praised for having been at the front line of the economic ‘reforms’. Between August 1991 and August 1994, the two attracted investments worth Rs. 114,000 crores (almost $ 38 billion). Yet, these were the states where the plague broke out. Even before the reforms began, Gujarat was spending only around Rs. 49 per capita on health. (The reform period brought more cuts.) The figure for Kerala, a much poorer state than Gujarat in economic terms, was Rs. 71.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69.

Again, Kerala scores high. Kerala’s rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is just 17. The figure for Gujarat is 73 and that for Maharashtra 69. The average Keralite can expect to live 72 years. For Gujaratis that figure is 61 years and for Maharashtrians 63.

Kerala’s IMR and life expectancy rates are comparable with those of the USA.

Biswas’s brother is also a ‘doctor’. Taking a diploma in homoeopathy at an institute the name of which he has regrettably forgotten, he now practises allopathy in the same village as his sibling.

Biswas’s brother is also a ‘doctor’. Taking a diploma in homoeopathy at an institute the name of which he has regrettably forgotten, he now practises allopathy in the same village as his sibling. He says he is an ‘R.M.P.’—but that doesn’t mean Registered Medical Practitioner. It stands for ‘Rural Medical Practitioner’.

‘The literate ones give less. The illiterate ones give more,’ says Biswas with disarming candour.

Their access to health depends on giving the local witch doctor a couple of eggs.

But we have built a health system for doctors, not patients.

But we have built a health system for doctors, not patients. For contractors and pharmacists, not for the public.

Words like ‘chloroquine’ and ‘paracetamol’ are not easy to handle even for English speakers. For a tipsy dissari, mixing mantras with mahua, they can be tricky and harmful if interchanged.

And one of the first things to happen was this: the people in the PHCs there got hauled up for talking to me and ‘leaking’ stuff from the records.

The actual gap between SC/ ST literacy levels and those of the non-SC/ ST population grew worse between 1961 and 1981.

‘There is no literate population that is poor; no illiterate population that is other than poor.’.

‘Those with good connections get the transfers they want. Others can get stuck twenty-five, thirty years in such places.’.

S.C. Jain saab is the principal of the Government Postgraduate College in Alirajpur. He is also in charge of all UGC programmes in the college. Besides, he is the head of the Botany department, the Physics department and the Law department. In past years, he has headed, at least temporarily, several other departments. He rounds off this portfolio by being the college sports officer. In his spare time—if a person of such onerous responsibilities can have any spare time —he practises ayurveda and homoeopathy. Clearly a man of many parts.

Anyway, the army excels at grabbing hill station areas.’.

Less than fifteen people found jobs, at very menial levels, in HAL, which has a total workforce of around 4,500. Another thirty also got into HAL, with some difficulty, as casual labourers. They had no security of tenure. Those who ‘made it’ as casual workers were offered an alternative home—120 km away from the HAL township.

Then, too, Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Orissa. ‘And he had this grand idea that all the units of HAL would come to Koraput.’ So huge tracts of land were acquired in pursuit of that vision.

The other units of HAL came up in Bangalore and elsewhere. As a result, thousands of acres forcibly taken over from the eighteen villages remain unused to this day.

Nothing of the sort happened, though. The other units of HAL came up in Bangalore and elsewhere. As a result, thousands of acres forcibly taken over from the eighteen villages remain unused to this day.

Botanists call it Dyospyros melanoxylon. Manufacturers call it beedi. Traders call it profits, politicians call it power and the poor call it survival.

‘The third crop in this region is drought relief.

‘Even the teesra fasl (third crop) doesn’t reach them,’ laughs a Jhabhar villager. Third crop? I enquire naively. I had only known of two. He was clearly hoping I would ask. ‘The third crop in this region is drought relief. The funds involved in it are huge but the harvest is generally reaped by block-level officials and their contractor friends.

Simply put, the Oriya migrants have to suffer because they came to Andhra Pradesh on their own. That they are very much in the grip of contractors here does not count. And secondly, the Andhra labour department cannot be held legally responsible for their plight.

Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go looking for the places only they would know.

The Malkangiri collector, G.K. Dhal, says the Bondas appear in a list of the fifteen most primitive tribes in the world.

A document I have obtained shows that Met-Chem has charged a consultancy fee of Rs. 105 crores in a project worth Rs. 966 crore. That’s an astronomical figure and one without a precedent in any comparable deal.

If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, Godda seems pretty much to belong to that highway.

‘And if you believe all these figures even begin to measure the reality,’ an experienced local advocate told me, ‘you need to have your head examined.

‘Every rupee you invest in arrack can bring you up to Rs 9 in return. So fines of a couple of thousand rupees don’t even scratch you mildly.’.

The moment a case is brought to court, said the advocate, the defence counsel says, ‘Yes, yes, my client admits to everything.’ The fine is paid. ‘Every rupee you invest in arrack can bring you up to Rs 9 in return. So fines of a couple of thousand rupees don’t even scratch you mildly.’.
