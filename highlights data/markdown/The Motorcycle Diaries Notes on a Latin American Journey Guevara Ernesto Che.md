In fact it’s probable, and there are no excuses, for these lips can only describe what these eyes actually see.

The trip was decided just like that, and it never erred from the basic principle laid down in that moment: improvisation.

For me, the sea has always been a confidant, a friend absorbing all it is told and never revealing those secrets; always giving the best advice — its meaningful noises can be interpreted any way you choose.

The first commandment for every good explorer is that an expedition has two points: the point of departure and the point of arrival. If your intention is to make the second theoretical point coincide with the actual point of arrival, don’t think about the means — because the journey is a virtual space that finishes when it finishes, and there are as many means as there are different ways of “finishing.” That is to say, the means are endless.

My tired eyes refused to sleep and in them a pair of green spots swirled, representing the world I had left for dead behind me and mocking the so-called liberation I sought. They harnessed their image to my extraordinary flight across the lands and seas of the world.

Distant countries, heroic deeds and beautiful women spun around and around in our turbulent imaginations.

Don’t know where, attributing it to Oscar Gálvez:* “When a piece of wire can replace a screw, give me the wire, it’s safer.”.

Invigorated by lunch, we set off with enthusiasm on the.

I confess I felt tempted to forget everything ever written about the rules of friendship and request a change of jobs.

In the way I traveled, first as a student and afterward as a doctor, I began to come into close contact with poverty, with hunger, with disease, with the inability to cure a child because of a lack of resources… And I began to see there was something that, at that time, seemed to me almost as important as being a famous researcher or making some substantial contribution to medical science, and this was helping those people.”.

They’re revealing the lesions of age. Gold doesn’t have the gentle dignity of silver which becomes.

Worked with Dr. Fernández, one of the most eminent leprologists.

Easily accessible articles for the general public, means that Machu Picchu.

My asthma worsened, though I was following my diet strictly. A careless caress from that easy girl who showed.

The great riverbanks are full of settlements. To find savage tribes you must follow the tributaries deep into the interior — and, this time at least, we don’t intend to make that journey.

Highlighting the asymmetry of his four front incisors: The future belongs to the people, and gradually, or in one strike, they will take power, here and in every country. The terrible thing is the people need to be educated, and this they cannot do before.

The future belongs to the people, and gradually, or in one strike, they will take power, here and in every country. The terrible thing is the people need to be educated, and this they cannot do before taking power, only after. They can only learn at the cost of their own mistakes, which will be very serious and will cost many innocent lives. Or perhaps not, maybe those lives will not have been innocent because they will have committed the huge sin against nature; meaning, a lack of ability to adapt. All of them, those unable to adapt — you and I, for example — will die cursing the power they helped, through great sacrifice, to create.

You are as useful as I am, but you are not aware of how useful your contribution is to the society that sacrifices you.

Individualism as such, as the isolated action of a person alone in a social environment, must disappear in Cuba.

Individualism as such, as the isolated action of a person alone in a social environment, must disappear in Cuba. Individualism tomorrow should be the proper utilization of the whole individual, to the absolute benefit of the community.
