Of course, the ideal position for reading is something you can never find.

It's not that you expect anything in particular from this particular book. You're the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything.

It's not that you expect anything in particular from this particular book. You're the sort of person who, on principle, no longer expects anything of anything. There are plenty, younger than you or less young, who live in the expectation of extraordinary experiences: from books, from people, from journeys, from events, from what tomorrow has in store. But not you. You know that the best you can expect is to avoid the worst.

Books Read Long Ago Which It's Now Time To Reread and the Books You've Always Pretended To Have Read And Now It's Time To Sit Down And Really Read Them.

(for the new you seek in the not new and for the not new you seek in the new).

In other words, it's better for you to restrain your impatience and wait to open the book at home.

Long novels written today are perhaps a contradiction: the dimension of time has been shattered, we cannot love or think except in fragments of time each of which goes off along its own trajectory and immediately disappears. We can rediscover the continuity of time only in the novels of that period when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded, a period that lasted no more than a hundred years.

The lights of the station and the sentences you are reading seem to have the job of dissolving more than of indicating the things that surface from a veil of darkness and fog.

I leave traces if I speak with someone because every word spoken is a word that remains and can crop up again later, with quotation marks or without.
