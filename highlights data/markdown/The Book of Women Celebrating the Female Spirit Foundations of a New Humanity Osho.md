Have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.

Please comment. I have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.

Understanding any expression of existence—men or women or trees or animals or birds—is the function of science, not of a mystic.

With Albert Einstein the whole history of science has taken a very different route because the more he went into the deepest core of matter, the more he became puzzled.

“You don’t understand. It is made in such a way that nobody can solve it—mathematician or no mathematician.”.

“It is made in this way so that the boy from the very beginning starts learning that life cannot be solved, cannot be understood.”.

Am a mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think my small boy will be able to?”.

“I am a mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think my small boy will be able to?”.

A psychiatrist is a fellow who asks you a lot of expensive questions that your wife asks you for nothing.

You may speak of love and tenderness and passion, but real ecstasy is discovering you haven’t lost your keys after.

Women begin by resisting a man’s advances and end by blocking his retreat.

You want to change a woman’s mind, agree with her.

If you want to change a woman’s mind, agree with her.

If you want to know what a woman really means, look at her—don’t listen to her.

The lady walked up to the policeman and said, “Officer, that man on the corner is annoying me.” “I have been watching the whole time,” said the cop, “and that man wasn’t even looking at you.” “Well,” said the woman, “isn’t that annoying?”.

The romantic young man turned to the beautiful young girl in his bed and asked, “Am I the first man you ever made love to?” She thought for a moment and then said, “You could be—I have a terrible memory for faces.”.

Ultimately the man who goes on trying to understand life proves to be a fool, and the man who enjoys life becomes wise and goes on enjoying life, because he becomes more and more aware of the mysterious that surrounds us.

One is that the woman is capable of producing life; man is not.

One is that the woman is capable of producing life; man is not. In that way he is inferior, and that inferiority has played a great role in the domination of women by men. The inferiority complex works in this way: It pretends to be superior—to deceive oneself and to deceive the whole world. So man down the ages has been trying to destroy the woman’s genius, talents, capacities, so that he can prove himself superior—to himself and to the world.

One difference I see is that a woman is more capable of love than a man is.

The woman can be satisfied with one love, utterly fulfilled, because she does not look at the body of the man, she looks at his innermost qualities.

Love never should be forced, love never should be an attempt. It should not be in the mind at all—you are playing, dancing, singing, enjoying … part of this long joy. If it happens, then it is beautiful. When love happens, it has beauty. When it is made to happen, it is ugly.

In Hinduism, the woman had to die when the husband died. What a great jealousy! You have possessed her your whole life, and even after death you want to possess her. You are afraid. She is beautiful, and when you are gone, who knows? She may find another partner, perhaps better than you. So the system of sati prevailed for thousands of years—the most ugly phenomenon you can imagine.

Man is very egoistic. That’s why I call him male chauvinistic. Man has created this society, and in this society there is no place for the woman. And she has tremendous qualities of her own! For example, if man has the possibility of intelligence, the woman has the possibility of love. It does not mean she cannot have intelligence; she can have intelligence, she just has to be given the chance to develop it. But love she is born with—she has more compassion, more kindness, more understanding. Man and woman are two strings of one harp, but both are in suffering separate from each other. And because they are suffering and do not know the reason, they start taking revenge on each other.

It is not enough to earn money, it is not enough to become a success in the world; more necessary is a beautiful home, and the woman has the capacity to change any house into a home. She can fill it with love; she has that sensitivity. She can rejuvenate man, help him relax.

“I hope you will become a mother of ten children, and finally, your husband will be your eleventh child. And unless you become a mother to your husband, you have not succeeded in being a true wife.”.

The woman who loves you can enhance your creativity, can inspire you to heights you have never dreamed of. And she asks nothing. She simply wants your love, which is her basic right.

Love never creates bondage, it gives freedom.

The woman should search into her own soul for her own potential and develop it, and she will have a beautiful future. Man and woman are neither equal nor unequal, they are unique. And the meeting of two unique beings brings something miraculous into existence.

Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.

But the truth is that the pain and suffering that women of the world have gone through is a thousandfold more than man has ever known.

All the knowledge, all your conditionings, the whole process of your upbringing, your education, your society and civilization—they constitute the shell which keeps you and your understanding imprisoned. But he is not mentioning a single word of what he means by “shell.”.

On one hand it protects, on another hand it destroys. It is true that if you keep the wonder in your eyes you will be surprised to know that even pain has its own sweetness, its own miracle, its own joy. It is not less wondrous than joy itself. But the strange fact is that the woman is always more like a child, more full of wonder than man. Man is always after knowledge—and what is knowledge? Knowledge is just a means to get rid of wonder. The whole of science is trying to demystify existence, and the word science means knowledge. And it is a very simple fact that the more you know, the less you wonder.

And what is man’s function? He does not participate in her pain. Nine months she suffers, the birth of the child she suffers—and what does the man do? As far as the man is concerned, he simply uses the woman as an object to fulfill his lust and sexuality. He is not concerned at all about what the consequence will be for the woman. And still he goes on saying, “I love you.” If he had really loved her, the world would not have been overpopulated. His word “love” is absolutely empty. He has treated her almost like cattle.

Unless you have a rebellious spirit you are not alive in the true sense of the word.

You can make anybody confess anything if you go on torturing him. A point comes when he feels it is better to confess rather than to unnecessarily suffer the same torture every day.

Real liberation will make the woman authentically a woman, not an imitation of man.

Real liberation will make the woman authentically a woman, not an imitation of man. Right now that’s what is happening: Women are trying to be just like men. If men smoke cigarettes then the woman has to smoke cigarettes. If they wear pants then the woman has to wear pants. If they do a certain thing then the woman has to do that. She is just becoming a second-rate man.

I would like the woman to become really a woman, because much depends on her. She is far more important than man because she carries in her womb both the woman and the man. She mothers both, the boy and the girl; she nourishes both. If she is poisoned, then her milk is poisoned, then her ways of bringing up children are poisoned.

The woman needs total freedom so that she can give freedom to man too. This is one of the fundamentals to be remembered: If you make somebody a slave you will be reduced to slavery ultimately, finally; you can’t remain free. If you want to remain free, give freedom to others; that’s the only way to be free.

The Liberation movement that is going on in the world is a man-created phenomenon, a male-created phenomenon. You will be surprised about it, that it is again a male conspiracy. Now man wants to get rid of women. He wants to have no responsibility. He wants to enjoy women, but only as fun. He does not want to take all the other responsibilities that come with it. Now, this is a subtle conspiracy: The man is trying to persuade women all over the world that the woman has to become independent. It is a subtle trick. And the male mind is cunning and the male mind is succeeding. And now many women have become poisoned by this idea.

In the past also it has been so. Man has persuaded women in the past that they are pure beings, angels. Man is dirty, boys are boys—but the woman? She is divine. Man has put woman on a high pedestal; that was his trick to control woman. Man has worshipped, and through worship he has controlled. And naturally, when the woman was on the pedestal she thought that she was something divine—she could not do those things that men are doing, she could not, because that was going against her ego. That high pedestal was very ego-satisfying. She was the mother, she was divine; she had more divine qualities than man. Man is ugly, immoral, and all that. Man has to be forgiven.

What is needed is that man should become more like woman, rather than woman becoming more like man.

The home is the visible womb outside the woman, it is a projection of the inner womb.

Want to say to the women of the whole world that your Liberation movement has not done anything, because it is in the hands of very stupid women. They are reactionaries, not revolutionaries. Otherwise, the simple and the most important thing, the first priority, is that the women should demand a separate vote, so that women can only vote for women, and men can only vote for men. Just a simple and single step, and all the parliaments of the world will be half-filled with women. And the women will be naturally in power because man by nature has a tendency to fight. He will create parties, political parties, religious ideologies—on small, minor, trivial things. So if the women in a parliament are one single whole, the other half, of men, will be divided into at least eight or ten parties. The whole world can move into the hands of women. And women are not interested in wars, women are not interested in nuclear weapons, women are not interested in communism or capitalism.

All these “isms” are from the head. Women are interested in being joyful, in small things of life: a beautiful house, a garden, a swimming pool. Life can be a paradise, but it is going to remain a hell unless man is removed from power altogether. And he can be remedied so easily.

Women are more irritable, nagging, bitchy, and the reason is that they have been deprived of something that is their birthright; and they don’t even know what it is.

Men and women should not be in a contract, like marriage. They should be in love—but they should retain their freedom. They don’t owe anything to each other.

The pill, in my opinion, is the greatest revolution that has happened in history. All its implications have not yet been made available to man. In the past it was difficult, because making love meant more and more children. That was destroying the woman, she was always pregnant. And to remain pregnant and give birth to twelve or twenty children is a torturous experience. Women were used like cattle.

And the greatest harm that has been done to her is marriage, because neither man nor woman is monogamous; psychologically they are polygamous. So their whole psychology has been forced against its own nature.

And the greatest harm that has been done to her is marriage, because neither man nor woman is monogamous; psychologically they are polygamous.

And because woman was dependent on man she had to suffer all kinds of insults—because man was the master, he was the owner, he had all the money.

The strange fact is, all religions are against prostitution—and they are the cause of it!.

The strange fact is, all religions are against prostitution—and they are the cause of it! They are all for marriage, and they cannot see a simple fact that prostitution came into existence with marriage.

Make your love a really festive affair, don’t make it a hit-and-run affair. Dance, sing, play music—and don’t let sex be cerebral. Cerebral sex is not authentic; sex should be spontaneous. Create the situation. Your bedroom should be a place as holy as a temple. In your bedroom don’t do anything else; sing and dance and play, and if love happens on its own, as a spontaneous thing, you will be immensely surprised that biology has given you a glimpse of meditation.

Love. It is unfortunate that even animals know how to love, and man has to be taught.

Once you have a sexual relationship with a woman, she cannot have respect for you. That has been the cost—because she knows you have used her.

Of the causes that marked the change between the Western woman and the Eastern, the first is Karl Marx. He proposed, and convinced the intelligentsia of the whole world, that poverty has nothing to do with any past life, or with fate, or with destiny; that it is not decided by God who should be poor and who should be rich. It is the social structure, the economic structure which decides who is going to be poor. And this structure can be changed, because it is not God-made—there is no God, as such—it is man-made.

The second hammering came from Sigmund Freud. He declared that men and women are equal, belong to the same species, and any theories or philosophies which condemn women are simply inhuman and male chauvinistic. And then the third and the last hammering came from Masters and Johnson’s research, which brought to light that the woman has been deprived of orgasm for centuries. It proved that man has been really inhuman in his behavior. As far as his own sexual needs were concerned he used the woman, but he did not allow the woman to enjoy sex.

The Women’s Liberation movement declares that they don’t want to have any relationship with men—cut off all relationships with men. And as a reaction, women should do everything to man that he has done to her: misbehave, mistreat, use dirty words as man has always done, smoke cigarettes as man has always done. Naturally, they are losing their grace, their beauty … dress just as man has always dressed. But it is a strange phenomenon that the way you dress changes so much. The Eastern woman’s dress has a grace, and it gives a grace to her whole body. The Western woman is trying to compete with cowboys—blue jeans, stupid-looking clothes, ugly hairdos. They think perhaps they are taking revenge—they are destroying themselves. But revenge always destroys you, reaction always destroys you. I would love to see them as rebels.

You are attracted to something which is a challenge to get.

“Now things cannot be beautiful. The wind that has blown is no longer there. The season has changed, it is no longer spring between us; no flowers blossom, no fragrance arises. It is time to part.”.

You don’t just go and start painting just because the canvas is available and the brush is there and the color is there. You don’t start painting. You don’t say, “All requirements are here, so I can paint.” You can paint—but you will not be a painter that way.

You meet a woman, the canvas is there. You immediately become a lover—you start painting, and she starts painting on you. Of course you both prove to be foolish—painted fools—and sooner or later you understand what is happening. But you never thought that love is an art. You are not born with the art, it is nothing to do with your birth. You have to learn it. It is the most subtle art.

The requirement is that a great lover is always ready to give love and is not bothered whether it is returned or not.

Each heart is a valley. If you pour love into it, it will respond.

The first lesson of love is not to ask for love, but just to give.

The first lesson of love is not to ask for love, but just to give. Become a giver. And people are doing just the opposite. Even when they give, they give only with the idea that love should come back. It is a bargain. They don’t share, they don’t share freely. They share with a condition. They go on watching out of the corner of their eye whether it is coming back or not. Very poor people … they don’t know the natural functioning of love. You simply pour, it will come.

And if it is not coming, nothing to be worried about—because a lover knows that to love is to be happy.

As one learns swimming by swimming, by loving one loves.

They just wait. From somewhere some Cleopatra will come and then they will open their heart, but by that time they have completely forgotten how to open it.

“You don’t love me anymore?” asked Mulla Nasruddin’s wife. “You never say anything nice to me anymore like you used to when we were courting.” She wiped a tear from her eye with the corner of her apron. “I love you, I love you,” retorted Mulla Nasruddin. “Now will you please shut up and let me drink my beer in peace?”.

In fact, society should create all barriers possible for marriage and no barrier for divorce.

The court should create barriers—live with the woman for two years at least, then the court can allow you to get married.

Two persons should be allowed to live together long enough to become acquainted, familiar with each other. And even if they want to get married, they should not be allowed. Then divorces will disappear from the world. The divorces exist because marriages are wrong and forced.

A romantic mood is good if you are a poet—and poets are not known to be good husbands or good wives. In fact poets are almost always single. They fool around but they never get caught, and hence their romance remains.

One should not get married to a woman or to a man in a poetic mood. Let the prose mood come, then settle.

Love is not a passion, love is not an emotion. Love is a very deep understanding that somebody somehow completes you. Somebody makes you a full circle. The presence of the other enhances your presence. Love gives freedom to be yourself; it is not possessiveness.

Just meditate over a few of Murphy’s sutras. First: It is good to be married occasionally. Second: A clever man tells a woman he understands her, a stupid man tries to prove it. Third: Marriage is a three-ringed circus: engagement ring, wedding ring, and suffer-ring. Fourth: Marriage may make the world go round, but so does a punch in the nose. Fifth: Saving a marriage from divorce: The only way is not to show up for the wedding. Sixth: A woman is God’s second mistake—man is the first, obviously—and two wrongs together don’t make a right. And the last: A woman is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of man. So beware! If you want to get married, who am I to object? I can only make you a little more aware. Think before you jump!.

Millions of people have decided not to love human beings anymore. It is better to love a dog, a cat, a parrot; it is better to love a car—because you can dominate them well, and the other never tries to dominate you. It is simple; it is not as complex as it is going to be with human beings.

Love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the.

Love needs great courage for the simple reason that the basic requirement of love is to drop the ego. And man is very afraid of dropping the ego. It seems almost like committing suicide. It only seems so because we don’t know anything other than the ego.

Them. You will give dignity to people by your love; you.

To relate is one of the greatest things of life: To relate means to love, to relate means to share. But before you can share, you must have. And before you can love you must be full of love, overflowing with love.

Two seeds cannot relate, they are closed. Two flowers can relate; they are open, they can send their fragrances to each other, they can dance in the same sun and in the same wind, they can have a dialogue, they can whisper.

Death is secure, life is insecurity.

One who wants to reach to the peaks has to take the risk of getting lost.

One who wants to climb the highest peaks has to take the risk of falling from somewhere, slipping down.

The flower is exposed—such a delicate thing, and exposed to so many hazards: A strong wind may come, it may rain cats and dogs, the sun may be too hot, some foolish man may pluck the flower. Anything can happen to the flower, everything can happen to the flower, the flower is constantly in danger.

Seed is safe; hence millions of people decide to remain seeds. But to remain a seed is to remain dead, to remain a seed is not to live at.

Seed is safe; hence millions of people decide to remain seeds. But to remain a seed is to remain dead, to remain a seed is not to live at all.

The seed cannot be destroyed so easily by the wind, the seed is very protected, secure.

First be, then all else shall be added unto you.

Relating is a process. Avoid relationships, and go deeper and deeper into relating.

My emphasis is on verbs, not on nouns; avoid nouns as much as possible. In language you cannot avoid, that I know; but in life, avoid—because life is a verb. Life is not a noun, it is really living, not life. It is not love, it is loving. It is not relationship, it is relating. It is not a song, it is singing. It is not a dance, it is dancing.

Meditate, find out your own center first. Before you can relate with somebody else, relate with yourself. That is the basic requirement to be fulfilled. Without it, nothing is possible. With it, nothing is impossible.

You can allow somebody to enter to your center only when you are not afraid, when you are not fearful.

Don’t be bothered about the result. That is the fear-oriented mind. Don’t think about what will happen out of it. Just be here, and act, totally. Don’t calculate. A fear-oriented man is always calculating, planning, arranging, safeguarding. His whole life is lost in this way.

“They are like a person who is naked, but never goes to take a bath in the river because he is afraid—where will he dry his clothes?”.

What have you got to lose? Nothing. This body will be taken by death. Before it is taken by death, give it to love. Whatsoever you have will be taken away. Before it is taken away, why not share it? That is the only way of possessing it. If you can share and give, you are the master. It is going to be taken away. There is nothing which you can retain forever. Death will destroy everything.

Nobody is against you! Even if you feel somebody is against you, he too is not against you—because everybody is concerned with himself, not with you.

When two centers meet, there is love. And love is an alchemical phenomenon—just like hydrogen and oxygen meet and a new thing, water, is created. You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want, as much.

You can have hydrogen, you can have oxygen, but if you are thirsty, they will be useless. You can have as much oxygen as you want, as much hydrogen as you like, but the thirst will not go.

The basic requirement is that the other has to be given absolute freedom to be himself.

First, never treat the child as yours, never possess the child. It comes through you, but it is not yours.

Love, but never possess the child.

Never treat a child like a child. Treat the child with deep respect. God has chosen.

Never treat a child like a child. Treat the child with deep respect. God has chosen you to be a host.

It is very difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child.

It is very difficult to respect the child. It is very easy to humiliate the child. Humiliation comes very easy because the child is helpless and cannot do anything, cannot retaliate, cannot react.

Once you respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him. You don’t try to impose anything on the child. You.

Once you respect the child, you don’t try to impose your ideas on him.

You help him to become more and more powerful in exploring the world, but you never give him directions.

Never, never help him in any way, force him in any way, to become a hypocrite.

Don’t listen to morality, don’t listen to religion, don’t listen to culture—listen to nature.

Whatsoever is natural is good—even if sometimes it is very difficult for you, very uncomfortable for you.

Before the child is born you should go as deeply as possible in meditation.

“I am pregnant, and the child is more important than getting angry at you.

“I am pregnant, and the child is more important than getting angry at you. This episode will pass and after a few days I will not remember who has insulted me and what I have done. But the child is going to be there at least seventy, eighty years in the world. It is a big project.”.

When a child is there you are both secondary; the child has every preference.

Give love, but never give a structure. Give love, but never give a character.

In fact, the mother never thinks of her child as a grown-up person who is able to be free.

So from this very moment, from the very beginning, be respectful and give him freedom.

He is not here in this world to follow your opinion.

You are creating something immensely valuable—you are carving a life, you are protecting a life.

Don’t take it too seriously, otherwise you will destroy the child. Your seriousness will become destructive. Take it playfully. The responsibility is there! But it has to be taken very playfully.

There are people who are afraid of women, and if you are afraid of women you can’t love them. How can love arise out of fear? And why are you afraid of women?—because your childhood was lived in fear of your mother. She was constantly after you, she was constantly hammering you. She was constantly telling you to do this and not to do that—of course, for your own good. She has crippled you, she has destroyed many things in you. She has made you phony because she has told you what is right to do. Whether you like it or not, whether it is spontaneously arising in you or not, you have to follow the order.

A boy who has really been dominated by the mother, who has been reduced into absolute obedience, will not be able to make love to a woman, because as he will come close to the woman psychologically he will go impotent. How can you make love to your mother? It is impossible.

It conditions the child to a certain religious ideology, political dogma, some philosophy, some theology.

Each child is angry with his mother. The mother has to prohibit many things, the mother has to say no—it cannot be avoided. Even a good mother sometimes has to say no, and restrict and deny. The child feels rage, anger. He hates the mother and loves the mother also because she is his survival, his source of life and energy. So he hates the mother and loves the mother together.

Love is like a breeze. You see … it just comes. If it is there it is there. Then it is gone. And when it is gone it is gone.

The religious priests, the popes and others, would not like man to live joyously for the simple reason that if people started living joyfully, cheerfully, blissfully, who will bother about their paradise.

The religious priests, the popes and others, would not like man to live joyously for the simple reason that if people started living joyfully, cheerfully, blissfully, who will bother about their paradise and their heaven?.

Everything new looks inhuman in the beginning.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her. And it is bound to be so, because whether you are man or woman, you are created by one man, one woman. They have contributed to you half and half. Your.

The truth is that every man carries a woman within him, and every woman carries a man within her. And it is bound to be so, because whether you are man or woman, you are created by one man, one woman. They have contributed to you half and half. Your father and your mother both are alive in you.

Love is so fulfilling that who cares about writing poetry? Poetry is written by people who have missed the train.

Love is so fulfilling that who cares about writing poetry? Poetry is written by people who have missed the train. Now they are somehow consoling themselves by writing poetry about love—love they do not know.

But I would like you to know that you will be a loser. You are competing with man, and you need not compete; you are already superior. You need not write poetry, you are poetry. Your love is your music. Your heart throbbing with your lover is your dance!.

The woman is the superior sex; she need not prove it.

But drop the idea that you will be creating something superior out of love. If you really want to create something, don’t think of love either, because love is so satisfying, so fulfilling. It is such a miracle, who wants to write poetry?.

I have never come across a single lover, man or woman, who has created poetry, who has created paintings, who has created sculptures, for the simple reason that they are so contented. All these creative things need a discontent, a wound which you have to cover up.

I am perfectly happy with your idea. Just do whatever creative endeavor you want to; but remember, you don’t have the inferiority complex of man, so you cannot compete with man in any way. You are already in a better position. Man is poor; just have compassion for the poor guy.

The other day you said that women create children, and men create arts and other material things.

In poor countries still the old idea continues that the more children you have the better off you will be economically. In the past it was true—it is absolutely false today. Mohammed married nine women and he allowed Mohammedans to marry four women, simply to create more Mohammedans, because there was constant war between the Mohammedans and the non-Mohammedans and it was a question of power—the politics of numbers.

Giving birth to a child is not anything conscious, deliberate, meditative. You are just being used by nature, by biology as a means to propagate the race, the species.

If a purpose is there—that you want to create a child—then it is business. If there is no purpose, if it is purposeless fun, then only does it have beauty, and then it does not create any bondage.

And man has been telling her, “You are great because you give birth to children!” This is a rationalization, this is a consolation. Beware of such tricks. Man has exploited woman in every possible way and it is time to finish this exploitation.

This has been one of the greatest calamities in human history: Because women have never been appreciated for their talents, they have by and by retarded their talents. Because a retarded woman was appreciated more, a foolish woman was appreciated more. She just had to have a beautiful, proportionate body and no mind, nothing more. She should be a cow—with no intelligence, with no penetrating awareness. That was expected, otherwise the man would feel embarrassed, hurt. So women have learned a trick down the ages—that the rule of the game is that the woman should not show her talents. If she is intelligent she should pretend she is stupid. If she is creative s <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>.
