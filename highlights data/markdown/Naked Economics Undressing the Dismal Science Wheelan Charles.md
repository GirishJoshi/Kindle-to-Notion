“An economist is someone who is good with numbers but does not have the personality to be an accountant.”.

But that we are far from understanding everything does not mean that we understand nothing.

That if you spent fourteen minutes talking to an economist you would have wasted twelve minutes.

Economists overwhelmingly agree that free international trade can improve the standard of living of the trading countries and that tariffs and import quotas reduce general welfare. Economists generally agree that rent controls reduce the volume and quality of housing.

It asks how much extra benefit can be achieved by incurring some extra cost.

Finally, the economist has a predilection to believe that welfare is increased by allowing individuals to make their own choices and to argue that competitive markets are a particularly efficient mechanism for giving expression to individual choices.

I have often considered writing a basic introduction to economics myself, but competing projects always intervened. Had I done so, this is the book I would have wanted to write.

Why basic economics made the collapse of the Soviet Union inevitable (allocating resources without a price system is overwhelmingly difficult in the long run),.

What economic benefit smokers provide for nonsmokers (they die earlier, leaving more Social Security and pension benefits for the rest of us),.

Why mandating more generous maternity leave benefits may actually be detrimental to women (employers may discriminate against young women when hiring).

The French government in 2000 undertook a program to tackle chronic double-digit unemployment with a policy that was the economic equivalent of fool’s gold.

The Socialist-led government lowered the maximum workweek from thirty-nine hours to thirty-five hours; the supposed logic was that if all people with jobs work fewer hours, then there will be work left over for the unemployed to do. The policy did have a certain intuitive appeal; then again, so does using leeches to suck toxins out of the body. Sadly, neither leeches nor a shorter workweek will cause anything but harm in the long run.

Suppose that ten job applicants are vying for a single position. Nine of the job candidates are white and one is black. The hiring company has an affirmative action policy stipulating that when minority and nonminority candidates are of equal merit, the minority candidate will be hired.

Further suppose that there are two top candidates; one is white, the other is black. True to policy, the firm hires the black candidate. Loury (who is black) makes this subtle but simple point: Only one of the white candidates has suffered from affirmative action; the other eight wouldn’t have gotten the job anyway. Yet all nine white candidates go away angry, feeling that they have been discriminated against. Loury is not necessarily a foe of affirmative action. He merely adds nuance to a discussion that usually has none. Affirmative action can harm the very race relations that it seeks to heal.

Or consider the periodic campaign to mandate that insurance companies cover the cost of two nights in the hospital for women who have delivered babies, rather than just one. President Bill Clinton found this issue sufficiently important that he vowed in his 1998 State of the Union address to end “drive-by deliveries.” But there is a cost to such a plan that should be made explicit. An extra night in the hospital is not medically necessary in most cases, but it is expensive, which is why new parents don’t pay for it themselves and insurance companies don’t want to pay for it either. If insurance companies are forced to offer this benefit (or any other new benefit mandated by law), then they will recover their extra costs by raising premiums. And when premiums go up, some people on the margin will no longer be able to afford any health insurance at all. So the real policy question is: Are we willing to pass a law that will make many women more comfortable if it means that a much smaller number of men and women will lose coverage for basic care?.

The more generous a health care system is in the benefits it guarantees, the more it is going to cost.

Economics presents us with a powerful, and not necessarily complex, set of analytical tools that can be used to look back and explain why events unfolded the way they did; to look around and make sense of the world; and to look forward so that we can anticipate the effects of major policy changes. Economics is like gravity: Ignore it and you will be in for some rude surprises.

More mortgages meant more commissions, and bigger mortgages meant bigger commissions.

And it can be explained best by incorporating psychology into economics, namely the tendency of individuals to believe that whatever is happening now is what’s most likely to happen in the future.

We humans underestimate some risks (obesity) and overestimate others (flying);.

We humans underestimate some risks (obesity) and overestimate others (flying); we let emotion cloud our judgment; we overreact to both good news and bad news (rising home prices and then falling home prices).

This book is not economics for dummies; it is economics for smart people who never studied economics (or have only a vague recollection of doing so). Most of the great ideas in economics are intuitive when the dressings of complexity are peeled away. That is naked economics.

There is a finite supply of everything worth having: oil, coconut milk, perfect bodies, clean water, people who can fix jammed photocopy machines, etc.

Economics starts with one very important assumption: Individuals act to make themselves as well off as possible.

The phrase “luxury good” actually has a technical meaning to economists; it is a good that we buy in increasing quantities as we grow richer—things like sports cars and French wines. Less obviously, concern for the environment is a luxury good.

The reason is simple enough: We care about the fate of the Bengal tiger because we can. We have homes and jobs and clean water and birthday cakes for our dogs.

Why did the chicken cross the road? Because it maximized his utility.

We may spend years in graduate school eating ramen noodles because it dramatically boosts our standard of living later in life.

When you bought this book, you implicitly decided not to spend that money somewhere else. (Even if you shoplifted the book, you could have stuffed a Stephen King novel in your jacket instead, which is flattering in its own kind of way.).

At the moment, you are reading instead of working, playing with the dog, applying to law school, shopping for groceries, or having sex. Life is about trade-offs, and so is economics.

My dad would say that we try to get the most bang for our buck.

Choose to market cigarettes. Similarly, the concept of cost is far richer (pardon the pun) than the dollars and cents you hand over at the cash register.

The real cost of something is what you must give up in order to get it, which is almost always more than just cash.

There is nothing “free” about concert tickets if you have to stand in line in the rain for six hours to get them.

Standing outside an office building when it is seventeen degrees outside is now part of the cost of smoking at work.

Why did the entrepreneur cross the road? Because he could make more money on the other side.

Why doesn’t Brad Pitt sell automobile insurance? Because it would be an enormous waste of his unique talents. Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell.

Why doesn’t Brad Pitt sell automobile insurance? Because it would be an enormous waste of his unique talents. Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell more insurance policies than the average salesman. But he is also one of a handful of people in the world who can “open” a movie, meaning that millions of people around the world will go to see a film just because Brad Pitt is in it.

Yes, he is a charismatic guy who could probably sell more insurance policies than the average salesman. But he is also one of a handful of people in the world who can “open” a movie, meaning that millions of people around the world will go to see a film just because Brad Pitt is in it. That is money in the bank in the risky Hollywood movie business, so studios are willing to pay handsomely to put Brad Pitt in a starring role—about $30 million a film. Insurance agencies would also be willing to pay for the Pitt charisma—but more like $30,000. Brad Pitt will go where he is paid the most. And he will be paid the most in Hollywood because that is where he can add the most value.

Sherwin Rosen dubbed the “superstar” phenomenon. Small differences in talent tend to become magnified into huge differentials in pay as a market becomes very large, such as the audience for professional basketball. One need only be slightly better than the competition in order to gain a large (and profitable) share of that market.

Labor is cheap in Nepal; lawn mowers are very expensive. The opposite is true in the United States, which is why we don’t see many teams of laborers using sickles.

The price will settle at the point where the number of dogs for sale exactly matches the number of dogs that consumers want to buy. If there are more potential pet owners than dogs available, then the price of dogs will go up. Some consumers will then decide to buy ferrets instead, and some pet shops will be induced by the prospect of higher profits to offer more dogs for sale. Eventually the supply of dogs will match the demand.

Look around and you will start to see it everywhere. Al Gore complained during the 2000 presidential campaign that his mother and his dog were taking the same arthritis medication but that his mother paid much more for her prescription.

So the profit-maximizing strategy is to charge one price for patients with two legs and another price for patients with four.

Consumers try to make themselves as well off as possible and firms try to maximize profits. Those are seemingly simple concepts, yet they can tell us a tremendous amount about how the world works.

The market rewards scarcity, which has no inherent relation to value. Diamonds.

The market does not provide goods that we need; it provides goods that we want to buy.

Our medical system does not provide health insurance for the poor. Why? Because they can’t pay for it. Our most talented doctors do provide breast enhancements and face-lifts for Hollywood stars. Why? Because they can pay for it. Meanwhile, firms can make a lot of money doing nasty things. Why do European crime syndicates kidnap young girls in Eastern Europe and sell them into prostitution in wealthier countries? Because it’s profitable.

Periodically the oil ministers from the OPEC nations will meet in an exotic locale and agree to limit the global production of oil. Several things happen shortly thereafter: (1) Oil and gas prices start to go up; and (2) politicians begin falling all over themselves with ideas, mostly bad, for intervening in the oil market. But high prices are like a fever; they are both a symptom and a potential cure. While politicians are puffing away on the House floor, some other crucial things start to happen. We drive less. We get one heating bill and decide to insulate the attic. We go to the Ford showroom and walk past the Expeditions to the Escorts.

High oil prices cause things to start happening on the supply side, too. Oil producers outside of OPEC start pumping more oil to take advantage of the high price; indeed, the OPEC countries usually begin cheating on their own production quotas. Domestic oil companies begin pumping oil from wells that were not economical when the price of petroleum was low. Meanwhile, a lot of very smart people begin working more seriously on finding and commercializing alternative sources of energy.

Eighty percent of American smokers say they want to quit; most of them don’t.

I will argue that a market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: a decent, if flawed, choice among many bad alternatives.

I will argue that a market economy is to economics what democracy is to government: a decent, if flawed, choice among many bad alternatives. Markets are consistent with our views of individual liberty. We may disagree over whether or not the government should compel us to wear motorcycle helmets, but most of us agree that the state should not tell us where to live, what to do for a living, or how to spend our money.

During the twentieth century, communist governments killed some 100 million of their own people in peacetime, either by repression or by famine.

The economic battle of the twentieth century was between capitalism and communism.

An effective conservation strategy must properly align the incentives of the people who live in or near the black rhino’s natural habitat.

Translation: Give local people some reason to want the animals alive rather than dead. This is the premise of the budding eco-tourism industry.

One of Adam Smith’s insights in The Wealth of Nations: “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from.

“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”.

These kinds of inefficiencies can also exist in nominally capitalist countries where large sectors of the economy are owned and operated by the state, such as India. By 1991, the Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation had been up and running for twelve years.3 Every day, twelve hundred employees reported to work with the avowed goal of producing fertilizer. There was just one small complication: The plant had never actually produced any salable fertilizer. None. Government bureaucrats ran the plant using public funds; the machinery that was installed never worked properly. Nevertheless, twelve hundred workers came to work every day and the government continued to pay their salaries.

Scandinavian countries, which offer generous government programs funded by high marginal tax rates, have seen large growth in the size of their black market economies.

Unemployed). Obviously good economics is not always good politics.

When I applied to graduate school many years ago, I wrote an essay expressing my puzzlement at how a country that could put a man on the moon could still have people sleeping on the streets.

Private costs of my behavior are different from the social costs.

We tallied up the costs of driving an Explorer rather than a Civic: more gas, more expensive insurance, higher car payments.

At the same time, smokers do provide a benefit to the rest of us. They die young. According to the American Lung Association, the average smoker dies seven years earlier than the average nonsmoker, which means that smokers pay into Social Security and private pension funds for all of their working lives but then don’t stick around very long to collect the benefits. Nonsmokers, on average, get more back relative to what they paid.

(And it’s arguable that some people in cold climates will benefit from climate change, so maybe they should pay me.).

To begin with, government sets the rules. Countries without functioning governments are not oases of free market prosperity. They are places in which it is expensive and difficult to conduct even the simplest business. Nigeria has one of the world’s largest reserves of oil and natural gas, yet firms trying to do business there face a problem known locally as BYOI—bring your own infrastructure.6 Angola is rich with oil and diamonds, but the wealth has financed more than a decade of civil war, not economic prosperity. In 1999, Angola’s rulers spent $900 million in oil revenues to purchase weapons. Never mind that one child in three dies before the age of five and life expectancy is a shocking forty-two years.7 These are not countries in which the market economy has failed; they are countries in which the government has failed to develop and sustain the institutions necessary to support a market economy. A report issued by the United Nations Development Program placed much of the blame for world poverty on bad government. Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work, the report concluded.

Government lowers the cost of doing business in the private sector in all kinds of ways: by providing uniform rules and regulations, such as contract law; by rooting out fraud; by circulating a sound currency. Government builds and maintains infrastructure—roads, bridges, ports, and dams—that makes private commerce less costly.

Contrary to popular opinion, most government benefits do not go to the poor; they go to the middle class in the form of Medicare and Social Security.

Still, government has the legal authority to play Robin Hood; other governments around the world, such as the European countries, do so quite actively. What does economics have to say about this? Not much, unfortunately. The most important questions related to income distribution require philosophical or ideological answers, not economic ones.

Economics does not provide the tools for answering philosophical questions related to income distribution.

If policymakers are concerned about some individual behavior, such as inadequate retirement savings, then the libertarian paternalistic option is to make the default option one that automatically puts a decent amount of money from every paycheck into a retirement account. That’s the “nudge.” Anyone is free to choose another option at any time. But a shockingly high proportion of people will stay wherever you put them in the first place.

There is an old joke, one of Ronald Reagan’s favorites, that goes something like this: A Soviet woman is trying to buy a Lada, one of the cheap automobiles made in the former Soviet Union. The dealer tells her that there is a shortage of these cars, despite their reputation for shoddy quality. Still, the woman insists on placing an order. The dealer gets out a large, dusty ledger and adds the woman’s name to the long waiting list. “Come back two years from now on March 17th,” he says. The woman consults her calendar. “Morning or afternoon?” she asks. “What difference does it make?” the surly dealer replies. “That’s two years from now!” “The plumber is coming that day,” she says.

Wen Kilama once famously pointed out that if seven Boeing 747s, mostly filled with children, crashed into Mt. Kilimanjaro every day, then the world would take notice. That is the scale on which malaria kills its victims.).

Specifically, the law stipulates that a technical college must provide 168 square feet of building space for each student (to ensure adequate space for learning). That formula precludes the Principal K. M. Kundnani College of Pharmacy from teaching more than 300 students—regardless of the fact that all the lecture halls on the top floor of the building are padlocked for lack of use.

True, the government can create jobs by spending billions of dollars on jet fighters, but we are paying for those jets with money from our paychecks, which means that we buy fewer televisions, we give less to charity, we take fewer vacations. Thus, government is not necessarily creating jobs; it may be simply moving them around, or, on net, destroying them. This effect of taxation is less obvious than the new defense plant at which happy workers churn out shiny airplanes.

(As one policy analyst once pointed out to me, it may be easy to lie with statistics, but it’s a lot easier to lie without them.).

“I know I’m wasting half my money; I just wish I knew which half.”.

Branding solves a problem for consumers: How do you select products whose quality or safety you can determine only after you use them (and sometimes not even then)?.

How does a firm save its profits from the death spiral of competition? By convincing the world (rightfully or not) that its mixture of corn syrup and water is different from everyone else’s mixture of corn syrup and water. Coca-Cola is not soda; it’s Coke. Producers of branded goods create a monopoly for themselves—and price their products accordingly—by persuading consumers that their products are like no other.

Nike clothes are not pieces of fabric sewn together by workers in Vietnam; they are Tiger Woods’s clothes. Even farmers have taken this message to heart. At the supermarket, one finds (and pays a premium for) Sunkist oranges, Angus beef, Tyson chickens.

And then there is Oprah’s book club, which has the capacity to send obscure books rocketing up the best-seller lists.

Harvard graduates do very well in life, but is that because they learned things at Harvard that made them successful, or is it because Harvard finds and admits talented students who would have done extraordinarily well in life anyway? In other words, does Harvard add great value to its students, or does it simply provide an elaborate “signaling” mechanism that allows bright students to advertise their talents to the world by being admitted to Harvard?.

“Children Smart Enough to Get into Elite Schools May Not Need to Bother.”.

“Don’t believe that the only school worth attending is one that would not admit you…. Recognize that your own motivation, ambition and talents will determine your success more than the college name on your diploma.”.

Human capital is the sum total of skills embodied within an individual: education, intelligence, charisma, creativity, work experience, entrepreneurial vigor, even the ability to throw a baseball fast.

Human capital is the sum total of skills embodied within an individual: education, intelligence, charisma, creativity, work experience, entrepreneurial vigor, even the ability to throw a baseball fast. It is what you would be left with if someone stripped away all of your assets—your job, your money, your home, your possessions—and left you on a street corner with only the clothes on your back. How would Bill Gates fare in such a situation? Very well. Even if his wealth were confiscated, other companies would snap him up as a consultant, a board member, a CEO, a motivational speaker. (When Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, the company that he founded, he turned around and founded Pixar; only later did Apple invite him back.) How would Tiger Woods do? Just fine. If someone lent him golf clubs, he could be winning a tournament by the weekend.

College education is reckoned to yield about a 10 percent return on investment, meaning that if you put down money today for college tuition, you can expect to earn that money back plus about 10 percent a year in higher earnings. Few people on Wall Street make better investments than that on a regular basis.

One handy trick in finance and economics is the rule of 72; divide 72 by a rate of growth (or a rate of interest) and the answer will tell you roughly how long it will take for a growing quantity to double (e.g., the principal in a bank account paying 4 percent interest will double in roughly 18 years). When productivity grows at 2.7 percent a year, our standard of living doubles every twenty-seven years. At 1.4 percent, it doubles every fifty-one years.

If productivity grows at 4 percent in Japan and 2 percent in the United States, then both countries are getting richer. To understand why, go back to our simple farm economy. If one farmer is raising 2 percent more corn and hogs every year and his neighbor is raising 4 percent more, then they are eating more every year (or trading more away).

If productivity grows at 4 percent in Japan and 2 percent in the United States, then both countries are getting richer. To understand why, go back to our simple farm economy. If one farmer is raising 2 percent more corn and hogs every year and his neighbor is raising 4 percent more, then they are eating more every year (or trading more away). If this disparity goes on for a long time, one of them will become significantly richer than the other, which may become a source of envy or political friction, but they are both growing steadily better off.

What would be the effect on America if 500 million people in India became more productive and gradually moved from poverty to the middle class? We would become richer, too. Poor villagers currently subsisting on $1 a day cannot afford to buy our software, our cars, our music, our books, our agricultural exports. If they were wealthier, they could. Meanwhile, some of those 500 million people, whose potential is currently wasted for lack of education, would produce goods and services that are superior to what we have now, making us better off. One of those newly educated peasants might be the person who discovers an AIDS vaccine or a process for reversing global warming. To paraphrase the United Negro College Fund, 500 million minds are a terrible thing to waste.

A woman in their sample was significantly more likely to seek paid employment if her sister’s husband earned more than her own.

Cornell economist Robert Frank, author of Luxury Fever, has made a persuasive case that relative wealth—the size of my pie compared to my neighbor’s—is an important determinant of our utility.

(A) You earn $110,000 and everyone else earns $200,000; or (B) you earn $100,000 and everyone else earns $85,000.

You would be richer in World A; you would be less wealthy in World B but richer than everyone else.

There a point at which income inequality stops motivating us to work harder and becomes counterproductive?.

Is there a point at which income inequality stops motivating us to work harder and becomes counterproductive?.

The subject of human capital begs some final questions. Will the poor always be with us, as Jesus once admonished? Does our free market system make poverty inevitable? Must there be losers if there are huge economic winners? No, no, and no. Economic development is not a zero-sum game; the world does not need poor countries in order to have rich countries, nor must some people be poor in order for others to be rich. Families who live in public housing on the South Side of Chicago are not poor because Bill Gates lives in a big house.

In theory, a world in which every individual was educated, healthy, and productive would be a world in which every person lived comfortably. Perhaps we will never cure the world of the assorted physical and mental illnesses that prevent some individuals from reaching their full potential. But that is biology, not economics. Economics tells us that there is no theoretical limit to how well we can live or how widely our wealth can be spread.

The way to induce people to do anything is to pay them a lot.

If everyone has a Harvard degree, who hauls away the sludge?.

The sludge hauler does. And he or she, incidentally, would be one of the best-paid workers in town. If the economy depends on hauling this stuff away, and no machine can do the task, then the community would have to induce someone to do the work. The way to induce people to do anything is to pay them a lot. The wage for hauling sludge would get bid up to the point that some individual—a doctor, or an engineer, or a writer—would be willing to leave a more pleasant job to haul sludge. Thus, a world rich in human capital may still have unpleasant tasks—proctologist springs to mind—but no one has to be poor.

Conversely, many people may accept less money to do particularly enjoyable work—teaching college students comes to mind (especially with the summer off).

A Random Walk Down Wall Street.

If the sultan of Brunei stuffed $1 billion under his mattress in 1970, it would be worth only $180 million today.

When economists slap fancy equations on the chalkboard, the symbol for the interest rate is r, not i. Why? Because the interest rate is considered to be the rental rate—r—on capital. And that is the most intuitive way to think about what is going on.

Harvard buys stocks and bonds, invests in venture capital funds, and otherwise puts $25 billion in the hands of people and institutions around the globe who can do productive things with it. From 1995 to 2005, the endowment earned an average 16 percent annual return, which is a lot more productive for the university than leaving the cash lying around campus. (Harvard also managed to lose 30 percent of its endowment during the financial crisis, so we’ll come back to the Harvard endowment when we talk about “risk and reward.”).

Shakespeare may have admonished us to be neither borrowers nor lenders; the fact is that most of us will be both at some point.

Meanwhile, big purchasers of commodities can benefit from being on the other side of the trade. Airlines use futures contracts to lock in a predictable price for jet fuel. Fast-food restaurants can enter into futures contracts for ground beef, pork bellies (most of which are made into bacon), and even cheddar cheese.

If hurricanes did relatively little damage that year, then the bondholders got their principal back plus nearly 12 percent in interest—a very nice return for a bond.

A credit default swap is really just an insurance policy on whether or not some third party will pay back its debts.

However, that same market also allows the rest of us to bet on whether or not your brother-in-law will pay back the loan. That’s not hedging a bet; that’s speculation. So for any single debt, there may be hundreds or thousands of contracts tied to whether or not it gets repaid.

If you play blackjack long enough—at least without counting cards—it is a mathematical certainty that you will go broke.

If assets are priced efficiently, then a monkey throwing darts at the stock pages should choose a porfolio that will perform as well, on average, as the portfolios picked by the Wall Street stars.

There is an old joke about two economists walking down the street. One of them sees a $100 bill lying in the street and points it out to his friend. “Is that a $100 bill lying in the gutter?” he asks. “No,” his friend replies. “If it were a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up already.” So they walk on by.

There is even a new field, neuroeconomics, that combines economics, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology to explore the role that biology plays in our decision making. One of the most bizarre and intriguing findings is that people with brain damage may be particularly good investors. Why? Because damage to certain parts of the brain can impair the emotional responses that cause the rest of us to do foolish things. A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and the University of Iowa conducted an experiment that compared the investment decisions made by fifteen patients with damage to the areas of the brain that control emotions (but with intact logic and cognitive functions) to the investment decisions made by a control group.

The impaired investors took more risks when there were high potential payoffs and got less emotional when they made losses.

Indexing is to investing what regular exercise and a low-fat diet are to losing weight: a very good starting point.

But you’ve got to have the spare capital first, and the only way to generate spare capital is to spend less than you earn—i.e., save.

The more you save, and the sooner you begin saving it, the more rent you can command from the financial markets.

The flip side, of course, is that if you are spending more cash than you earn, then you will have to “rent” the difference somewhere.

The cost of living better in the present is living less well in the future.

The first step is far more simple: Save early, save often, and pay off the credit cards.

The beauty of running a casino is that the numbers are stacked in your favor. If you are willing to wait long enough—and pose happily for photos as you give a giant check to the occasional big winner—then you will get rich.

The fascinating thing about economics is that the fundamental ideas don’t change.

And I’m positive that Americans will not have become thin and healthy by eating only grapefruit and ice cream.

Of course, neither scientists nor environmentalists are convinced that ethanol is such a great thing.

Found that ethanol had little effect on either the environment or our dependence on foreign oil.

The ethanol subsidy had, however, cost the Treasury $7.1 billion in forgone tax revenues.

Worse, ethanol may actually make some kinds of air pollution worse. It evaporates faster than pure gasoline, contributing to ozone problems in hot temperatures. A 2006 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that ethanol does reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent relative to gasoline, but it calculated that devoting the entire U.S. corn crop to make ethanol would replace only a small fraction of American gasoline consumption. Corn farming also contributes to environmental degradation due to runoff from fertilizer and pesticides.

“Regardless of whether ethanol is a great fuel for cars, it certainly works wonders in Iowa campaigns.”.

The ethanol tax subsidy increases the demand for corn, which puts money in farmers’ pockets. Just before the Iowa caucuses, corn farmer Marvin Flier told the Times, “Sometimes I think [the candidates] just come out and pander to us,” he said. Then he added, “Of course, that may not be the worst thing.” The National Corn Growers Association figures that the ethanol program increases the demand for corn, which adds 30 cents to the price of every bushel sold.

He realized that ethanol is crucial to Iowa voters, and Iowa is crucial to the presidential race.

He realized that ethanol is crucial to Iowa voters, and Iowa is crucial to the presidential race. Since then, every mainstream presidential candidate has supported the ethanol subsidy, except one: John McCain.

While Senator McCain’s “straight talk” is admirable, let us remind ourselves of one important detail: John McCain is not currently president of the United States. That would be Barack Obama—an ethanol subsidy supporter. Ethanol is not.

While Senator McCain’s “straight talk” is admirable, let us remind ourselves of one important detail: John McCain is not currently president of the United States. That would be Barack Obama—an ethanol subsidy supporter.

Think about ethanol again. The benefits of that $7 billion tax subsidy are bestowed on a small group of farmers, making it quite lucrative for each one.

The opposite would be true with my plan to have left-handed voters pay subsidies to right-handed voters.

If the government has to support the price of milk, the real problem is that there are too many dairy farmers.

The teachers’ unions, one of the most potent political forces in America, always support reforms that require more rigorous training and testing for teachers. Read the fine print, though. Almost without exception, these laws exempt current teachers from whatever new requirement is being imposed.

The teachers’ unions, one of the most potent political forces in America, always support reforms that require more rigorous training and testing for teachers. Read the fine print, though. Almost without exception, these laws exempt current teachers from whatever new requirement is being imposed. In other words, individuals who would like to become teachers have to take additional classes or pass new exams; existing teachers do not.

(1) Good teachers matter. Students assigned to the best quarter of teachers ended up 10 percentile points ahead of students given the worst quarter of teachers (controlling for the students’ initial level of achievement); and (2) certification doesn’t matter.

The best predictor of whether or not a profession is licensed in Illinois is the size and budget of its professional association.

The individuals standing in capitalism’s path of progress—or destruction, from their standpoint—will use every tool they have to avoid it, including politics.

Consider that at the beginning of the fifteenth century, China was far more technologically advanced than the West. China had a superior knowledge of science, farming, engineering, even veterinary medicine. The Chinese were casting iron in 200 B.C., some fifteen hundred years before the Europeans. Yet the Industrial Revolution took place in Europe while Chinese civilization languished. Why? One historical interpretation posits that the Chinese elites valued stability more than progress. As a result, leaders blocked the kinds of wrenching societal changes that made the Industrial Revolution possible. In the fifteenth century, for example, China’s rulers banned long-sea-voyage trade ventures, choking off trade as well as the economic development, discovery, and social change that come with them.

“Where you stand depends on where you sit.”.

Earmarks are the mechanism by which members of Congress insert pork into bills; an earmark directs federal money to a specific project in a member’s district and is therefore insulated from any formal review as to whether the project makes sense or not.

The democratic process will always favor small, well-organized groups at the expense of large, diffuse groups.

It’s not just how many people care one way or the other; it’s how much they care.

Two percent who care deeply about something are a more potent political force than the 98 percent who feel the opposite but aren’t motivated enough to do anything about it.

“And that is: I don’t want to tell you something that’s going to make you not like me. If I had a choice between getting a round of applause by delivering a twenty-six-second applause line and getting a round of boos by telling you the truth, I’d rather get the round of applause.”.

GDP, which represents the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy.

It means simply that we as a country produced 2.3 percent more goods and services than we did the year before.

First, what we care about is real GDP, which means that the figure has been adjusted to account for inflation. In contrast, nominal figures have not been adjusted for inflation. If nominal GDP climbs 10 percent in 2012 but inflation is also 10 percent, then we haven’t actually produced more of anything.

It’s the economic equivalent of swapping a $10 bill for ten $1 bills—it looks good in your wallet, but you’re not any richer.

For now, suffice it to say that our standard of living depends on the quantity of goods and services we take home with us, not on the price that shows up at the register.

Second, we care about GDP per capita, which is a nation’s GDP divided by its population. Again, this adjustment is necessary to prevent wildly misleading conclusions. India has a GDP of $3.3 trillion while Israel has a GDP of $201 billion. Which is the richer country? Israel by far. India has more than a billion people while Israel has only seven million; GDP per capita in Israel is $28,300 compared to only $2,900 in India. Similarly, if a country’s economy grows 3 percent in a given year but the population grows 5 percent, then GDP per capita will fall. The country is producing more goods and services, but not enough more to keep up with a population that is growing faster.

In other words, the average American is five.

In other words, the average American is five times as rich as he or she would have been in 1940.

“Making money takes time, so when we shop, we’re really spending time. The real cost of living isn’t measured in dollars and cents but in the hours and minutes we must work to live.”1 So here goes: A pair of stockings cost 25 cents.

Other economists have concluded that the growth rate of GDP per capita in Europe between 500 and 1500 was essentially zero.2 They don’t call it the Dark Ages for nothing.

GDP does not count any economic activity that is not paid for, such as work done in the home. If you cook dinner, take care of the kids, and tidy up around the house, none of that counts toward the nation’s official output. However, if you order out food, drop your kids off at a child care center, and hire a cleaning lady, all of that does. Nor does GDP account for environmental degradation; if a company clear-cuts a virgin forest to make paper, the value of the paper shows up in the GDP figures without any.

If a small minority of a country’s population grow fabulously rich while most citizens are getting steadily poorer, per capita GDP growth could still look impressive.

Human Development Index (HDI) as a broader indicator of national economic health. The HDI uses GDP as one of its components but also adds measures of life expectancy, literacy, and educational attainment.

HDI is a good tool for assessing progress in developing countries; it tells us less about overall well-being in rich countries where life expectancy, literacy, and educational attainment are already relatively high.

Similarly, growing richer must make us better off because we can do and have more of the things that we enjoy. Yet survey results tell us something different. Richer may not be happier. Remember that robust growth of the 1990s? It didn’t seem to do much good for our psyches. In fact, the period of rising real incomes from 1970 to 1999 coincided with a decrease in those who described themselves as “very happy” from 36 percent to 29 percent.5 Economists are belatedly beginning to probe this phenomenon, albeit in their own perversely quantitative way. For example, David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald, economists at Dartmouth College and the University of Warwick, respectively, found that a lasting marriage is worth $100,000 a year, since married people report being as happy, on average, as divorced (and not remarried) individuals who have incomes that are $100,000 higher. So, before you go to bed tonight, be sure to tell your spouse that you would not give.

Any measure of economic progress depends on how you define progress.

All else equal, it is better for a nation to produce more goods and services than fewer. When GDP turns negative, the damage is real: jobs lost, businesses closed, productive capacity turned idle.

My thrift—a decision to curtail my advertising budget or to buy a car next year instead of this year—may cost you your job, which will in turn hurt my business! Indeed, if we all believe the economy is likely to get worse, then it will get worse.

Indeed, if we all believe the economy is likely to get worse, then it will get worse. And if we all believe it will get better, then it will get better. Our behavior—to spend or not to spend—is conditioned on our expectations, and those expectations can quickly become self-fulfilling.

The general rule of thumb, based on research done by economist Arthur Okun and known thereafter as Okun’s law, is that GDP growth of 3 percent a year will leave the unemployment rate unchanged.

Thus, GDP growth of 4 percent would lower unemployment by half a percentage point, and GDP growth of only 2 percent would cause unemployment to rise by half a percentage point.

The concept is simple enough; a budget deficit occurs when the government spends more than it collects in revenues and a surplus is the opposite.

When that tap is open wide, interest rates fall and we spend more freely on things that require borrowed money—everything from new cars to new manufacturing plants.

When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power. Paul Krugman once wrote,.

When the cost of borrowed funds goes up, our spending slows. It is an awesome power. Paul Krugman once wrote, “If you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.” The same is now true of Ben Bernanke.

Robert Mundell, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics, has argued that bungled monetary policy in the 1920s and 1930s caused chronic deflation that destabilized the world. He has argued, “Had the price of gold been raised in the late 1920s, or, alternatively, had the major central banks pursued policies of price stability instead of adhering to the gold standard, there would have been no Great Depression, no Nazi revolution, and no World War II.”.

If we begin to spend more freely when rates are cut from 7 percent to 5 percent, why stop there? If there are still people without jobs and others without new cars, then let’s press on to 3 percent, or even 1 percent. New money for everyone! Sadly, there are limits to how fast any economy can grow. If low interest rates, or “easy money,” causes consumers to demand 5 percent more new PT Cruisers than they purchased last year, then Chrysler must expand production by 5 percent. That means hiring more workers and buying more steel, glass, electrical components, etc. At some point, it becomes difficult or impossible for Chrysler to find these new inputs, particularly qualified workers. At that point, the company simply cannot make enough PT Cruisers to satisfy consumer demand; instead, the company begins to raise prices. Meanwhile, autoworkers recognize that Chrysler is desperate for labor, and the union demands higher wages.

In short, an “easy money” policy at the Fed can cause consumers to demand more than the economy can produce. The only way to ration that excess demand is with higher prices. The result is inflation.

The first is the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow funds directly from the Federal Reserve.

The relationship between the discount rate and the cost of borrowing at Citibank is straightforward; when the discount rate falls, banks can borrow more cheaply from the Fed and therefore lend more cheaply to their customers.

Borrowing directly from the Fed carries a certain stigma; it implies that a bank was not able to raise funds privately. Thus, turning to the Fed for a loan is similar to borrowing from your parents after about age twenty-five: You’ll get the money, but it’s better to look somewhere else first.

The second important tool in the Fed’s money supply kit is the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge other banks for short-term loans.

Banks hold bonds for the same reason individual investors do; bonds are a safe place to park funds that aren’t needed for something else. Specifically, banks buy bonds with depositors’ funds that are not being loaned out.

Think of the Fed as always driving in unfamiliar terrain with a map that’s at least ten years out of date.

We were speeding even though the gauges we’re used to looking at said we weren’t.

To economists, money is quite distinct from wealth. Wealth consists of all things that have value—houses, cars, commodities, human capital.

Money, a tiny subset of that wealth, is merely a medium of exchange, something that facilitates trade and commerce.

(The word “salary” comes from the wages paid to Roman soldiers, who were paid in sacks of sal—salt.).

(Imagine life without a unit of account: The Gap is selling jeans for three chickens a pair while Tommy Hilfiger has similar pants on sale for eleven beaver pelts. Which pants cost more?).

Cigarettes long served as the medium of exchange in prisons, where cash is banned.

The basic idea did not change. Whether money was public or private, paper currency derived its value from the fact that it could be redeemed for a set quantity of gold or silver, either from a bank or from the government. Then something strange happened. In 1971, the United States permanently went off the gold standard. At that point, every paper dollar became redeemable for…nothing.

Examine that wad of $100 bills in your wallet. (If necessary, $1 bills can be substituted instead.) Those bills are just paper. You can’t eat them, you can’t drink them, you can’t smoke them, and, most important, you can’t take them to the government and demand anything in return. They have no intrinsic value. And that is true of nearly all the world’s currencies. Left alone on a deserted island with $100 million, you would quickly perish. On the other hand, life would be good if you were rescued and could take the cash with you. Therein lies the value of modern currency: It has purchasing power. Dollars have value because people peddling real things—food, books, pedicures—will accept them.

And people peddling real things will accept dollars because they are confident that other people peddling other real things will accept them, too. A dollar is a piece of paper whose value derives solely from our confidence that we will be able to use it to buy something we need in the future.

To give you some sense of how modern money is a confidence game, consider a bizarre phenomenon in India. Most Indians involved in commerce—shopkeepers, taxi drivers, etc.—will not accept a torn, crumpled, or overly soiled rupee note. Since other Indians know that many of their countrymen will not accept torn notes, they will not accept them either. Finally, when tourists arrive in the country, they quickly learn to accept only intact bills, lest they be stuck with the torn ones. The whole process is utterly irrational, since the Indian Central Bank considers any note with a serial number—torn, dirty, crumpled, or otherwise—to be legal tender. Any bank will exchange torn rupees for crisp new ones. That doesn’t matter; rational people refuse legal tender because they believe that it might not be accepted by someone else. The whole bizarre phenomenon underscores the fact that our faith in paper currency is predicated on the faith that others place in the same paper.

The new tractor probably wasn’t any more expensive than the old tractor in real terms, meaning that he had to do the same amount of work, or less, in order to buy it. The sticker price on his tractor had gone up, but so had the prices at which he could sell his crops and cattle.

The method of determining this figure is surprisingly low-tech; government officials periodically check the prices of thousands and thousands of goods—clothes, food, fuel, entertainment, housing—and then compile them into a number that reflects how the prices of a basket of goods purchased by the average consumer has changed.

The most instructive way to think about inflation is not that prices are going up, but rather that the purchasing power of the dollar is going down.

Indeed, the mark lost so much value that it became cheaper for households to burn them than to use them to buy firewood.

Even today, it is not possible to get a thirty-year fixed mortgage in much of Latin America because of fears that inflation will come roaring back.

Suppose that American incomes rose 5 percent last year. That is a meaningless figure until we know the inflation rate. If prices rose by 7 percent, then we have actually become worse off.

Comparing gross receipts in 2010 to gross receipts in 1970 or 1950 is a silly exercise unless they are adjusted for inflation. A ticket to Gone with the Wind cost 19 cents. A ticket to Dude, Where’s My Car? cost $10. Of course the gross receipts are going to look big by comparison.

Inflation also redistributes wealth arbitrarily. Suppose I borrow $1,000 from you and promise to pay back the loan, plus interest of $100, next year. That seems a fair arrangement for both of us. Now suppose that a wildly irresponsible central banker allows inflation to explode to 100 percent a year. The $1,100 that I pay back to you next year will be worth much less than either of us had expected; its purchasing power will be cut in half. In real terms, I will borrow $1,100 from you and pay back $550. Unexpected bouts of inflation are good for debtors and bad for lenders—a crucial point that we will come back.

The nominal rate is used to calculate what you have to pay back; it’s the number you see posted on the bank window or on the front page of a loan document.

The real interest rate is the nominal rate minus the rate of inflation.

Suppose you buy a stock and sell it a year later, earning a 10 percent return. If the inflation rate was also 10 percent over that period, then you have not actually made any money.

Inflation is bad; deflation, or steadily falling prices, is much worse.

If prices are falling, then borrowing $100 today and paying back $100 next year is not costless.

To hark back to the politics of organized interests covered in Chapter 8, one theory for why Japanese officials have not done more to fight falling prices is that Japan’s aging population, many of whom live on fixed incomes or savings, see deflation as a good thing despite its dire consequences for the economy as a whole.

In 1992, George Soros made nearly $1 billion in a single day for the investment funds he managed. Most people need several weeks to make a billion dollars, or even a month.

Currencies are no different than any other good; the exchange rate, or the “price” of one currency relative to another,.

Currencies are no different than any other good; the exchange rate, or the “price” of one currency relative to another, is determined by supply relative to demand.

(1) The government could use its reserves of other foreign currencies to buy pounds—directly boosting demand for the currency; or (2) the government could use monetary policy to raise real interest rates, which, all else equal, makes British bonds (and the pounds necessary to buy them) more lucrative to global investors and attracts capital (or keeps it from leaving).

The British economy was in bad shape; raising interest rates during a recession slows the economy even further, which makes for bad economics and even worse politics.

National borders are political demarcations, not economic ones.

You buy your Toyota in dollars. Toyota must pay its Japanese workers and executives in yen. And that is where things begin to get interesting.

The American dollar is just a piece of paper. It is not backed by gold, or rice, or tennis balls, or anything else with intrinsic value. The Japanese yen is exactly the same. So are the euro, the peso, the rupee, and every other modern currency. When individuals and firms begin trading across national borders, currencies must be exchanged at some rate. If the American dollar is just a piece of paper, and the Japanese yen is just a piece of paper, then how much American paper should we swap for Japanese paper?.

A Japanese yen has value because it can be used to purchase things; a dollar has value for the same reason. So, in theory, we ought to be willing to exchange $1 for however many yen or pesos or rubles would purchase roughly the same amount of stuff in the relevant country.

If a bundle of everyday goods costs $25 in the United States, and a comparable bundle of goods costs 750 rubles in Russia, then we would expect $25 to be worth roughly 750 rubles (and $1 should be worth roughly 30 rubles). This is the theory of purchasing power parity, or PPP.

By the same logic, if the value of the ruble is losing 10 percent of its purchasing power within Russia every year while the U.S. dollar is holding its value, we would expect the ruble to lose value relative to the U.S. dollar (or depreciate) at the same rate. This isn’t advanced math; if one currency buys less stuff than it used to, then anyone trading for that currency is going to demand more of it to compensate for the diminished purchasing power.*.

If $100 can be exchanged for enough pesos to buy significantly more stuff in Mexico, who would want the $100? Many of us would trade our dollars for pesos so that we could buy extra goods and services in Mexico and live better.

Or rental housing. In a modern economy, more than three-quarters of goods and services are nontradable.

Using the same Mumbai meal example, you should recognize why PPP is the most accurate mechanism for comparing incomes across countries. At official exchange rates, a Mumbai salary may look very low when converted to dollars, but because many nontradable goods and services are much less expensive in Mumbai than in the United States, a seemingly low salary may buy a much higher standard of living than the official exchange rate would suggest.

Currencies that buy more than PPP would predict are said to be “overvalued” currencies that buy less are “undervalued.”.

Of late, the value of the renminbi relative to the dollar has been a significant source of tension between the United States and China—a topic we’ll come back to later in this chapter.

The U.S. dollar is weak, meaning that it can be exchanged for fewer yen or euros than normal, then foreign goods become more expensive.

At the same time, a weak dollar makes American goods less expensive for the rest of the world.

An undervalued currency promotes exports (and therefore the industries that produce them). At the same time, a cheap currency raises the costs of imports, which is bad for consumers.

A government that deliberately keeps its currency undervalued is essentially taxing consumers of imports and subsidizing producers of exports.

A country with a booming economy will often have a currency that is appreciating. Strong growth presents investment opportunities that attract capital from.

In order to defend the nation’s gold reserves, the central bank must raise interest rates—even though a weakening economy needs the opposite.

“In the early 1930s this mentality led governments to raise interest rates and slash spending, despite mass unemployment, in an attempt to defend their gold reserves. And even when countries went off gold, the prevailing mentality made them reluctant to cut rates and create jobs.”.

Countries pledge to maintain their exchange rates at some predetermined rate with a group of other countries—such as the nations of Europe.

A central bank raises or lowers interest rates by making its currency more or less scarce.

Countries that share a currency with other nations, such as the European countries that adopted the euro, must give up control over their own monetary policy.

Even little kids trading snacks in the lunchroom recognize that what you give up should be worth what you get back.

Any country that is consuming more than it produces must by definition be running a current account deficit because (1) the stuff you are consuming beyond what you produce must come from somewhere else in the world; and (2) you can’t trade goods and services for the extra stuff that you’re getting from the rest of the world because you’ve consumed everything you have.

There are only four broad things that Farmer America can do with what he grows: He can eat it (consumption); he can plant it for next year’s crop (investment); he can send it to the government to pay for services (government spending); or he can trade it for other stuff (exports traded for imports). That’s it.

So far, the United States owes China about a trillion dollars.

The United States gets loans from China to buy its exports.

“You could say—and I would—that globalization, driven not by human goodness but by the profit motive, has done far more good for far more people than all the foreign aid and soft loans ever provided by well-intentioned governments and international agencies.”.

“But in saying this, I know from experience that I have guaranteed myself a barrage of hate mail.”.

Having made that case in many different venues, now I get hate mail, too. Sometimes it’s actually kind of clever. My favorite is an e-mail that came in response to a column arguing that a richer, rapidly growing India is good for the United States. After the usual introduction arguing that my job should be outsourced to some low wage country as soon as possible, the e-mail concluded, “Why don’t you and Tom Friedman [author of the pro-globalization book The World Is Flat] get a room together? The world isn’t flat, it’s just your head!” Others tend to be less subtle, such as the e-mail with the subject line: YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Yes, that is the exact number of exclamation points.).

Abraham Lincoln was once advised to buy cheap iron rails from Britain to finish the transcontinental railroad. He replied, “It seems to me that if we buy the rails from England, then we’ve got the rails and they’ve got the money. But if we build the rails here, we’ve got our rails and we’ve got our money.”4 To understand the benefits of trade, we must find the fallacy in Mr. Lincoln’s economics. Let me paraphrase his point and see if the logical flaw becomes clear: If I buy meat from the butcher, then I get the meat and he gets my money. But if I raise a cow in my backyard for three years and slaughter it myself, then I’ve got the meat and I’ve got my money. Why don’t I keep a cow in my backyard?.

We trade with others because it frees up time and resources to do things that we are better at.

Saudi Arabia can produce oil more cheaply than the United States can. In turn, the United States can produce corn and soybeans more cheaply than Saudi Arabia. The corn-for-oil trade is an example of absolute advantage. When different countries are better at producing different things, they can both consume more by specializing at what they do best and then trading. People in Seattle should not grow their own rice. Instead, they should build airplanes (Boeing), write software (Microsoft), and sell books (Amazon)—and leave the rice-growing to farmers in Thailand or Indonesia. Meanwhile, those farmers can enjoy the benefits of Microsoft Word even though they do not have the technology or skills necessary to produce such software. Countries, like individuals, have different natural advantages. It does not make any more sense for Saudi Arabia to grow vegetables that it.

Workers in Bangladesh do not have to be better than American workers at producing anything for there to be gains from trade. Rather, they provide goods to us so that we can spend our time specializing at whatever we do best. Here is an example. Many engineers live in Seattle. These men and women have doctorates in mechanical engineering and probably know more about manufacturing shoes and shirts than nearly anyone in Bangladesh. So why would we buy imported shirts and shoes made by poorly educated workers in Bangladesh? Because our Seattle engineers also know how to design and manufacture commercial airplanes. Indeed, that is what they do best, meaning that making jets creates the most value for their time. Importing shirts from Bangladesh frees them up to do this, and the world is better off for it. Productivity is what makes us rich. Specialization is what makes us productive. Trade allows us to specialize.

Mark Twain anticipated the fundamental dilemma: “I’m all for progress; it’s change I don’t like.”.

“Globalization disrupts everything, everywhere. It disrupts established patterns of life—between husband and wife, parents and children; between men and women, young and old; between boss and worker, governor and governed.”.

Can the antiglobalization protesters explain how poor countries will get richer if they trade less with rest of the world—like Gaza? Cutting off trade leaves a country poorer and less productive—which is why we tend to do it to our enemies.

Cheaper goods have the same impact on our lives as higher incomes.

So it is in this case. Representatives from developing nations were the ones who complained most bitterly about the disruption of the WTO talks in Seattle. Some believed.

Most famously, cheap exports were the path to prosperity for the Asian “tigers”—Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (and for Japan before that).

India was strikingly insular during the four decades after achieving independence from Britain in 1947; it was one of the world’s great economic underachievers during that stretch.

Is there an example in modern history of a single country successfully developing without trading and integrating with the global economy?.

“The Coalition to Keep the World’s Poor People Poor.”.

By global standards, poor does not mean settling for a Ford Fiesta when you really wanted the BMW. Poor is watching your children die of malaria because you could not afford a $5 mosquito net.

Yet inadequate access to safe drinking water—a problem easily cured by rising living standards—kills two million people a year and makes another half billion seriously ill. Is global warming a serious problem? Yes. Would it be your primary concern if children in your town routinely died from diarrhea? No. The first fallacy related to trade and the environment is that poor countries should be held to the same environmental standards as the developed world.

I remember the first day of an environmental economics course when visiting professor Paul Portney, former head of Resources for the Future, pointed out that the very act of staying alive requires that we produce waste.

The case for keeping people poor because it’s good for the planet is economically and morally bankrupt.

Anyone who is not a socialist before he is thirty has no heart; anyone who is still a socialist after he is thirty has no head.

At a time when we can split the atom, land on the moon, and decode the human genome, why do 2 billion people live on less than $2 a day?2.

The relationship between government institutions and economic growth prompted a clever and intriguing study. Economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson hypothesized that the economic success of developing countries that were formerly colonized has been affected by the quality of the institutions that their colonizers left behind.6 The European powers adopted different colonization policies in different parts of the world, depending on how hospitable the area was to settlement. In places where Europeans could settle without serious hardship, such as the United States, the colonizers created institutions that have had a positive and long-lasting effect on economic growth. In places where Europeans could not easily settle because of a high mortality rate from disease, such as the Congo, the colonizers simply focused on taking as much wealth home as quickly as possible, creating what the authors refer to as “extractive states.”.

The answer, according to Mr. Sachs, is that high temperatures and heavy rainfall are bad for food production and conducive to the spread of disease.

Because cold winters control mosquitoes—not because scientists have beaten the disease.

The sad fact is that scientists, like bank robbers, go where the money is. Pharmaceutical companies earn profits by developing blockbuster drugs for consumers in the developed world. Of the 1,233 new medicines granted patents between 1975 and 1997, only thirteen were for tropical diseases.

Strategies such as “self-sufficiency” and “state leadership” were hallmarks of the postcolonial regimes, such as India and much of Africa.

Natural resources matter less than you would think. Israel, which has no oil to speak of, is a far richer country than nearly all of its Middle Eastern neighbors that have large petroleum reserves. Israeli GDP per capita is $28,300 compared to $20,500 for Saudi Arabia and $12,800 for Iran.

Economists believe that a rich endowment of natural resources may actually be a detriment to development.

Meanwhile, demand for a nation’s currency rises as the rest of the world begins to buy its diamonds or bauxite or oil or natural gas. That will cause the currency to appreciate, which, we now know, makes the country’s other exports, such as manufactured goods, more expensive.

He writes, “[Famines] have never materialized in any country that is independent, that goes to elections regularly, that has opposition parties to voice criticisms and that permits newspapers to report freely and question the wisdom of government policies without extensive censorship.”27 China had the largest recorded famine in history; thirty million people died as the result of the failed Great Leap Forward in 1958–1961. India has not had a famine since independence in 1947.

A peasant discovers that many of his chickens are dying, so he seeks advice from a priest. The priest recommends that the peasant say prayers for his chickens, but the chickens continue to die. The priest then recommends music for the chicken coop, but the deaths continue unabated. Pondering again, the priest recommends repainting the chicken coop in bright colors. Finally, all the chickens die. “What a shame,” the priest tells the peasant, “I had so many more good ideas.”.

“There are no confident assertions here of what works and what doesn’t—and no blueprints for policymakers to adopt. The emphasis is on the need for humility, for policy diversity, for selective and modest reforms, and for experimentation.”.

I realize that pointing out the failure of development aid and then arguing for more of it is like Yogi Berra criticizing a restaurant for having bad food and small portions. Still, things become better when there is an overwhelming political will to make them better. That is bigger than economics.

We talk about how important education is, but we make it difficult and time-consuming for smart people to become teachers.
