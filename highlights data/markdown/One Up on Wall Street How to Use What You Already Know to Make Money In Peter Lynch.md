Own stocks where results depend on ancient fundamentals: a successful company enters new markets, its earnings rise, and the share price follows along.

To my mind, the stock price is the least useful information you can track, and it’s the most widely tracked.

If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings—assuming the company in question has earnings.

If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings—assuming the company in question has earnings. As you’ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.

Happen with the Internet. A big.

A big name or two will capture the territory, the way McDonald’s did with burgers or Schlumberger did with oil services. Shareholders in those triumphant companies will prosper, while shareholders in the laggards, the has-beens, and the should-have-beens will lose money. Perhaps you’ll be clever enough to pick the big winners that join the exclusive club of companies that earn $1 billion a year.

Whenever you invest in any company, you’re looking for its market cap to rise. This can’t happen unless buyers are paying higher prices for the shares, making your investment more valuable. With that in mind, before DotCom.com can turn into a tenbagger, its market cap must increase tenfold, from $10 billion to $100 billion. Once you’ve established this target market cap, you have to ask yourself: What will DotCom.com need to earn to support a $100 billion valuation? To get a ballpark answer, you can apply a generic price/earnings ratio for a fast-growing operation—in today’s heady market, let’s say 40 times earnings.

The first is an offshoot of the old “picks and shovels” strategy: During the Gold Rush, most would-be miners lost money, but people who sold them picks, shovels, tents, and blue jeans (Levi Strauss) made a nice profit.

Today, you can look for non-Internet companies that indirectly benefit from Internet traffic (package delivery is an obvious example); or you can invest in manufacturers of switches and related gizmos that keep the traffic moving.

I mention Microsoft and Cisco to add contemporary examples to illustrate a major theme of this book. An amateur investor can pick tomorrow’s big winners by paying attention to new developments at the workplace, the mall, the auto showrooms, the restaurants, or anywhere a promising new enterprise makes its debut. While I’m on the subject, a clarification is in order.

Never invest in any company before you’ve done the homework on the company’s earnings prospects, financial condition, competitive position, plans for expansion, and so forth.

Lately, healthy companies are skimping on their dividends and using the money to buy back their own shares, à la General Electric.

Long-term investing has gotten so popular, it’s easier to admit you’re a crack addict than to admit you’re a short-term investor.

Amgen has become a genuine biotech blue chip, with earnings of $1 billion plus.

It’s foolish to bet we’ve seen the last of the bears, which is why it’s important not to buy stocks or stock mutual funds with money you’ll need to spend in the next twelve months to pay college bills, wedding bills, or whatever. You don’t want to be forced to sell in a losing market to raise cash. When you’re a long-term investor, time is on your side.

If you own good companies that continue to increase their earnings, you’ll do well.

You didn’t have to be a genetic engineer to realize that Amgen had transformed itself from a research lab into a pharmaceutical manufacturer with two best-selling drugs.

Stop listening to professionals! Twenty years in this business convinces me that any normal person using the customary three percent of the brain can pick stocks just as well, if not better, than the average Wall Street expert.

It means ignoring the stocks that you hear Peter Lynch, or some similar authority, is buying.

The first stock I ever bought, Flying Tiger Airlines, turned out to be a multibagger that put me through graduate school.

Whenever Lynch advances, the market declines.

Investing in stocks is an art, not a science, and people who’ve been trained to rigidly quantify everything have a big disadvantage.

Logic is the subject that’s helped me the most in picking stocks, if only because it taught me to identify the peculiar illogic of Wall Street. Actually Wall Street thinks just as the Greeks did. The early Greeks used to sit around for days and debate how many teeth a horse has. They thought they could figure it out by just sitting there, instead of checking the horse. A lot of investors sit around and debate whether a stock is going up, as if the financial muse will give them the answer, instead of checking the company.

Soon enough I became known as the Will Rogers of equities, the man who never saw a stock he didn’t like.

“Don’t gamble; take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”.

To the list of famous oxymorons—military intelligence, learned professor, deafening silence, and jumbo shrimp—I’d add professional investing.

In fact, between the chance of making an unusually large profit on an unknown company and the assurance of losing only a small amount on an established company, the normal mutual-fund manager, pension-fund manager, or corporate-portfolio manager would jump at the latter. Success is one thing, but it’s more important not to look bad if you fail. There’s an unwritten rule on Wall Street: “You’ll never lose your job losing your client’s money in IBM.”.

Almost by definition the result will be mediocre, but acceptable mediocrity is far more comfortable than diverse performance.

I am reminded here of the Vonnegut short story in which various highly talented practitioners are deliberately held back (the good dancers wear weights, the good artists have their fingers tied together, etc.) so as not to upset the less skillful.

There’s an unwritten rule that the bigger the client, the more talking the portfolio manager has to do to please him.

For instance, the SEC says a mutual fund such as mine cannot own more than ten percent of the shares in any given company, nor can we invest more than five percent of the fund’s assets in any given stock.

When you ask a bank to handle your investments, mediocrity is all you’re going to get in a majority of the cases.

In other words, I continue to think like an amateur as frequently as possible.

Historically, investing in stocks is undeniably more profitable than investing in debt. In fact, since 1927, common stocks have recorded gains of 9.8 percent a year on average, as compared to 5 percent for corporate bonds, 4.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.4 percent for Treasury bills.

There’s a logical explanation for this. In stocks you’ve got the company’s growth on your side. You’re a partner in a prosperous and expanding business. In bonds, you’re nothing more than the nearest source of spare change.

In bonds, you’re nothing more than the nearest source of spare change. When you lend money to somebody, the best you can hope for is to get it back, plus interest.

The relationship between them and McDonald’s begins and ends with the payoff of the debt, and that’s not the exciting part of McDonald’s. Sure, the original bondholders have gotten their money back, the same as they would have with a bank CD, but the original stockholders have gotten rich.

Think of the people who’ve owned McDonald’s bonds over the years. The relationship between them and McDonald’s begins and ends with the payoff of the debt, and that’s not the exciting part of McDonald’s. Sure, the original bondholders have gotten their money back, the same as they would have with a bank CD, but the original stockholders have gotten rich.

You’ll never get a tenbagger in a bond—unless you’re a debt sleuth who specializes in bonds in default.

Six out of ten is all it takes to produce an enviable record on Wall Street.

Before you buy a share of anything, there are three personal issues that ought to be addressed: (1) Do I own a house? (2) Do I need the money? and (3) Do I have the personal qualities that will bring me success in stocks?.

“Never invest in anything that eats or needs repairs”.

It takes a moving van to get out of a house, and only a phone call to get out of a stock.

Only invest what you could afford to lose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the foreseeable future.

When E.F. Hutton talks, everybody is supposed to be listening, but that’s just the problem. Everybody ought to be trying to fall asleep. When it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here is not listening, it’s snoring. The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed. If not, your only hope for increasing your net worth may be to adopt J. Paul Getty’s surefire formula for financial success: “Rise early, work hard, strike oil.”.

Well, maybe not all economists. Certainly not the ones who are reading this book, and especially not the ones like Ed Hyman at C. J. Lawrence who looks at scrap prices, inventories, and railroad car deliveries, totally ignoring Laffer curves and phases of the moon. Practical economists are economists after my own heart.

Remember, things are never clear until it’s too late.

You don’t have to be a vice president at Exxon to sense the growing prosperity in that company, or a turnaround in oil prices. You can be a roustabout, a geologist, a driller, a supplier, a gas-station owner, a grease monkey, or even a client at the gas pumps.

So often we struggle to pick a winning stock, when all the while a winning.

So often we struggle to pick a winning stock, when all the while a winning stock has been struggling to pick us.

The professional’s edge is especially helpful in knowing when and when not to buy shares in companies that have been around awhile, especially those in the so-called cyclical industries. If you work in the chemical industry, then you’ll be among the first to realize that demand for polyvinyl chloride is going up, prices are going up, and excess inventories are going down. You’ll be in a position to know that no new competitors have entered the market and no new plants are under construction, and that it takes two to three years to build one. All this means higher profits for existing companies that make the product.

Every time I look at the Dreyfus chart, it reminds me of the advice I’ve been trying to give you all along: Invest in things you know about.

Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards.

You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years.

You don’t buy stock in a giant such as Coca-Cola expecting to quadruple your money in two years. If you buy Coca-Cola at the right price, you might triple your money in six years, but you’re not going to hit the jackpot in two.

Once I’ve established the size of the company relative to others in a particular industry, next I place it into one of six general categories: slow growers, stalwarts, fast growers, cyclicals, asset plays, and turnarounds.

There are almost as many ways to classify stocks as there are stockbrokers—but I’ve found that these six categories cover all of the useful distinctions that any investor has to make.

“things are more like they are now than they ever were before.”.

Alcoa once had the same kind of go-go reputation that Apple Computer has today, because aluminum was a fast-growth industry.

Another sure sign of a slow grower is that it pays a generous and regular dividend. As I’ll discuss more fully in Chapter 13, companies pay generous dividends when they can’t dream up new ways to use the money to expand the business. Corporate managers would much prefer to expand the business, an effort that always enhances their prestige, than to pay a dividend, an effort that is mechanical and requires no imagination.

I look for the ones that have good balance sheets and are making substantial profits. The trick is figuring out when they’ll stop growing, and how much to pay for the growth.

McDonald’s is a classic fast grower, but because of the thousands of outlets it either owns or is repurchasing from the franchisees, it could be a great future asset play in real estate.

Are you looking for slow growth, fast growth, recession protection, a turnaround, a cyclical bounce, or assets?.

Unless it’s a turnaround, there’s no point in owning a utility and expecting it to do as well as Philip Morris.

Unless it’s a turnaround, there’s no point in owning a utility and expecting it to do as well as Philip Morris. There’s no point in treating a young company with the potential of a Wal-Mart like a stalwart, and selling for a 50 percent gain, when there’s a good chance that your fast grower will give you a 1,000-percent gain.

There’s no point in treating a young company with the potential of a Wal-Mart like a stalwart, and selling for a 50 percent gain, when there’s a good chance that your fast grower will give you a 1,000-percent gain. On the other hand, if Ralston Purina already has doubled and the fundamentals look unexciting, you’re crazy to hold on to it with the same hope.

Getting the story on a company is a lot easier if you understand the basic business. That’s why I’d rather invest in panty hose than in communications satellites, or in motel chains than in fiber optics. The simpler it is, the better I like it. When somebody says, “Any idiot could run this joint,” that’s a plus as far as I’m concerned, because sooner or later any idiot probably is going to be running it.

If a company with terrific earnings and a strong balance sheet also does dull things, it gives you a lot of time to purchase the stock at a discount. Then when it becomes trendy and overpriced, you can sell your shares to the trend-followers.

That’s a name with promise to begin with—any company that uses a k where there ought to be a c is worth investigating.
