But fossil fuels cause pollution,.

But fossil fuels are nonrenewable,.

But fossil fuels are replaceable by solar and wind,.

Eighty-seven percent of the energy mankind uses every second, including most of the energy I am using as I write this, comes from burning one of the fossil fuels: coal, oil, or natural gas.

Every time someone uses a machine—whether the computer I am using right now, the factory it was produced in, the trucks and ships that transported it, the furnace that forged the aluminum, the farm equipment that fed all the workers who made it, or the electricity that keeps their lights on, their phones charged, and their restaurants and hospitals open—they are using energy that they must be able to rely on and afford. And 87 percent of the time, that energy comes from coal, oil, or natural gas.2 Without exception, anyone who lives a modern life is directly or indirectly using large amounts of fossil fuel energy—it is that ubiquitous.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The risks and side effects of using fossil fuels declined while the benefits—cheap, reliable energy and everything it brings—expanded to billions more people.

While college philosophy classes all too often present philosophy as an impractical subject that involves endlessly debating skeptical questions (“How do you know you exist?” “How do you know you’re not in The Matrix?”), philosophy is in fact an incredibly practical tool. No matter what we’re doing in life, whether we’re coming up with a business plan or raising children or deciding what to do about fossil fuels, it is always valuable to be able to think clearly about what is right and what is wrong and why.

During that time period, the world overall increased fossil fuel usage far more than we did. Today the world uses 39 percent more oil, 107 percent more coal, and 131 percent more natural gas than it did in 1980.26.

What will promote human life? What will promote human flourishing—realizing the full potential of life? Colloquially, how do we maximize the years in our life and the life in our years? When we look at the recent past, the past that was supposed to be so disastrous, we should look at flourishing—and that of course includes the quality (or lack thereof) of our environment.

Pessimistic predictions often assume that our environment is perfect until humans mess it.

Pessimistic predictions often assume that our environment is perfect until humans mess it up; they don’t consider the possibility that we could improve our environment.

It’s the moral case for using cheap, plentiful, reliable energy to amplify our abilities to make the world a better place—a better place for human beings.

No other energy technology besides fossil fuels can even come close to producing that energy for the foreseeable future.

The average human being needs about 2,000 calories a day to give him enough energy to do everything he needs to do—from going to the office to taking a walk to manual labor to sleeping. That’s equal to 2,326 watt-hours, which is the amount of energy it takes to power a 100-watt lightbulb for 23.26 hours.

Power is energy in action;.

Gasoline is the energy, the engine turns it into power.

Now if we were all like Superman, it would be a different story. Imagine if Superman, instead of devoting himself to saving Lois Lane and others, decided to help poor countries industrialize. He would be amazing! Superman’s superpower, after all, is power. He is a high-powered machine that stores a lot of energy in his body. He can melt iron, forge steel, plow fields, build buildings, even run an electrical system by turning some sort of especially large crank. He could transform any place for the better.

Industrial progress, mechanical improvement, all of the great wonders of the modern era have meant little to the wealthy. The rich in ancient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modern plumbing—running servants replaced running water. Television and radio—the patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home, could have the leading artists as domestic retainers. Ready-to-wear clothing, supermarkets—all these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life. They would have welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine, but for the rest, the great achievements of western capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person. These achievements have made available to the masses conveniences and amenities that were previously the exclusive prerogative of the rich and powerful.

There are 7 billion people in the world, but 1.3 billion have no electricity.7 Over 3 billion are classified as not having “adequate electricity”—a threshold that is far less than we enjoy and take for granted.8 For everyone to have as much access to energy as the average American, the world’s energy production would have to quadruple.9 And we Americans would benefit greatly from even more cheap, plentiful, reliable energy.

The top five countries ranked by solar energy consumption are Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and China. The percentage of each country’s electricity that comes from solar energy is, respectively: 4.5 percent, 6.3 percent, 4.0 percent, .09 percent, and .6 percent.

Don’t let the 16.5 percent in Spain mislead you. Spain suffered financial devastation from its investment in wind, among other bad investments.

In fact, modern solar and wind technology do not produce reliable energy, period.

The diluteness problem and the intermittency problem.

Imagine you have a company of highly productive, efficient, reliable workers. Then there is an initiative to bring in “renewable” workers, who will supposedly live forever, but they are expensive and you don’t know when they’ll show up. A document produced by them is not as valuable as a document produced by someone else—because you don’t know when theirs will arrive. A company can handle a few such workers, but it can’t be run by them.

Throughout history it has been a challenge for human beings to produce enough crops to feed us, because agriculture requires a lot of resources just to produce our meager number of calories. We need many dozens of times as many calories for our machines as we do from our food! If we could eat oil or electricity, we would, because it’s much cheaper per unit of energy. Why should we feed human food to machines with hundreds of times our appetites?.

Delivers thousands of times more energy per unit of input.

The difficulty of doing it cheaply and the perceived difficulty of doing it safely.

Fossil fuels are so called because they are (in most theories) high-energy concentrations of ancient dead plants.

The other advantage they have is that they exist in astonishingly, astonishingly large quantities. For example, the world has an estimated 3,050 years (at current usage rates) of “total remaining recoverable reserves” of coal.

But in the future, it might be worth it—which means that claims that we’ll “run out of oil” are misguided, as coal and gas can effectively produce oil if needed.

Is almost eerily engineered by natural processes, not just for cheapness, not just for reliability, not just for scalability, but also for another characteristic crucial to a functional civilization: portability.

Oil is the most coveted (and controversial) fuel in the world because it is almost eerily engineered by natural processes, not just for cheapness, not just for reliability, not just for scalability, but also for another characteristic crucial to a functional civilization: portability.

Oil, in effect, has the ultimate strength to weight ratio.

A gallon of gasoline has 31,000 calories—the amount of energy you use in fifteen days. Oil can be refined into stable, potent liquid fuels—gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.

Held it in place for decades. Portability is valuable for many reasons. Personally, oil is the fuel of freedom—the fuel that liberated Americans to go where they want, when they want. Economically, oil is the fuel of trade. Our entire standard of living depends on specialization—on people doing what they do best, wherever they are, and then being able to cheaply move their products to those who most need them. The higher the price of portable power, the slower the world economy moves.

Tesla Roadster battery has an energy density that is 107 times less than gasoline—though the battery’s electric motor can convert more than twice as much of that energy into usable energy as the engine in a gasoline-powered car, so in practice the Tesla battery might be 35 times less dense.

You are probably sitting in a room with at least fifty things derived from oil, from the insulation in your wall to the carpet under your feet to the laminate on your table to the screen on your computer. Oil is everywhere—that is how the average American uses 2.5 gallons each day.

Because oil—or coal, or natural gas, or uranium, or aluminum for that matter—is not naturally a resource.

It was a distinct raw material, to be sure, with the potential to become valuable, just as sand has the potential to become a microchip.

What turned oil from a potential resource to an actual resource was human ingenuity—the ingenuity of the chemist Benjamin Silliman Jr., who refined petroleum into kerosene, the ingenuity of George Bissell, who targeted Titusville, Pennsylvania, as a location likely to have underground oil, and the ingenuity of Edwin Drake, who created the first successful oil well in 1859 at 69.5 feet underground.

The rubber tires are made of oil, the paint and waterproofing are made of oil, the plastic, dent-resistant bumper is made of oil, the stuffing inside the seats is made of oil, and in most cars, the entire interior is one form of oil fabric or synthetic material or another—because oil is such a cheap and effective way to make things.

When a policeman has his life saved by a bulletproof vest, when a firefighter has his life saved by a fireproof jacket, that is oil—that is something that was once a useless raw material, now made into a resource.

Our concern for the future should not be running out of energy resources; it should be running out of the freedom to create energy resources, including our number-one energy resource today, fossil fuels.

More fossil fuel energy, more ability to pursue happiness.

Having a background in philosophy, I recognized that most discussion of global warming would not stand up to fifteen seconds of scrutiny by Socrates, who alienated fellow Athenians by asking them to define what they meant when they used terms vaguely. I think Socrates would have been all over anyone who spoke vaguely of global warming or climate change without making clear which version of that theory they meant: mild warming or catastrophic warming.

How does fossil fuel use affect climate livability?.

“CEOs of fossil energy companies know what they are doing [by emitting CO2] and are aware of long-term consequences of continued business as usual. In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.”.

Note in particular that since the late 1990s, there has been no increase in average temperatures.

With an elaborate equation or program that will “postdict”.

But a model is not valid until it makes real, forward predictions. It’s a truism in any field of math that if you are allowed enough complexity, you can engage in “curve fitting” for any pattern of data with an elaborate equation or program that will “postdict” exactly what happened in the past—but in no way does that mean it will predict the future. (Many investors lose money doing this sort of thing.).

Since the industrial revolution, we’ve increased CO2 in the atmosphere from .03 percent to .04 percent, and temperatures have gone up less than a degree Celsius, a rate of increase that has occurred at many points in history.25 Few deny that during the last fifteen-plus years, the time of record and accelerating emissions, there has been little to no warming—and the models failed to predict that.26 By contrast, if one assumed that CO2 in the atmosphere had no major positive feedbacks, and just warmed the atmosphere in accordance with the greenhouse effect, this mild warming is pretty much what one would get.

Idso and others, conducting thousands of experiments in controlled conditions—where everything is held constant except CO2—have convincingly demonstrated that more CO2 means more plant growth.

Worldwide increases in plant growth are nontrivial—indeed, Idso and others attribute significant portions of modern agricultural yields to increased atmospheric CO2.

Below 120 to 150 ppm CO2, most plants die, which means human beings would die. All things being equal, in terms of plant growth, agriculture, et cetera, more CO2 is better. Today’s climate gives us far less CO2 than we would like from a plant-growth perspective. We would prefer the thousands of ppm CO2 that, say, the Cretaceous period had.45.

Extremely positive plant effects of CO2 are scientifically uncontroversial yet practically never mentioned, even by the climate-science community.

What’s also striking is how, even though we all know that plants live on CO2, almost no one in the culture thinks of potential positive impacts when he thinks about his “carbon footprint.”.

My reading of the evidence is that there is a mild greenhouse effect in the direction human beings have always wanted—warmer—and a significant fertilizer effect in the direction human beings have always wanted—more plant life.

Fossil fuel energy, by enabling us to cheaply build and run wondrous machines that give us the mobility to choose any particular climate and the ability to increase the livability of that climate, has made us masters of climate. That doesn’t mean we are invulnerable, but the numbers show that we have become progressively less vulnerable. And if we care about climate livability, energy and technology have to be the focus.

Finally, on an emotional note, I think that a proper reaction to a major danger from fossil fuels would be sorrow. Think about it: If the energy that runs our civilization has a tragic flaw, that is a terribly sad thing. It would be even worse, say, than if wireless technology caused brain cancer. The appropriate attitude would be gratitude toward the fossil fuel companies for what they had done for us, combined with recognition that we would have to suffer a lot in the years ahead, combined with the commitment to the best technologies that I mentioned earlier.

“The winners of the race to reinvent energy will not only save the planet, but will also make megafortunes . . . fixing global warming won’t be a drain on the economy. On the contrary, it will unleash one of the greatest floods of new wealth in history,”.

Believe that we owe the fossil fuel industry an apology. While the industry has been producing the energy to make our climate more livable, we have treated it as a villain. We owe it the kind of gratitude that we owe anyone who makes our lives much, much better. There.

To oppose fossil fuels is ultimately to oppose the underdeveloped world.

Development means water-purification systems, irrigation, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, genetically improved crops, dams, seawalls, heating, air-conditioning, sturdy homes, drained swamps, central power stations, vaccination, pharmaceuticals, and so on.

When we transform those ancient dead plants into energy, bad things can happen.

Modern coal technology can harness coal energy extremely cheaply, and it is available in enormous quantities in many regions of the world. One of its disadvantages lies in its natural properties. As a solid fuel of condensed biological origin, it includes a lot of materials that were part of the natural environment long ago and that are potentially harmful to human health, such as sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy metals.

“the most dangerous part of a trip to a coal mine is the drive there.”.

Respect individual rights, including property rights. You have a right to your person and property, including the air and water around you. Past a certain point, it is illegal for anyone to affect you or your property. But—and here’s where things get tricky—it’s not obvious what that point is. Let’s look at two extremes.

The role of government is to pass laws based on individual rights and standards set according to science and the current state of technological evolution. The job of industry is to continue that evolution.

Countries with higher pollution levels have systematically shown lower rates of chronic respiratory diseases like asthma.

A poison or pollutant is always a combination of substance and dose.

One variant of this argument used to attack shale energy is the claim that fracking causes earthquakes.

This assertion is true in that fracking causes some amount of underground, earth-moving activity, but in almost all cases, it is completely inconsequential and not even discernible at the surface.

What about a worst-case scenario? Many say that it’s between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, which means you can feel the quake but it’s unlikely strong enough to cause damage.22 And this is an incredibly unlikely scenario. For this we are supposed to ban all fracking?.

Even if fracking in a certain place had a high risk of a truly dangerous earthquake—say, because it is near some seismically vulnerable area—that is an argument against fracking in that particular place, not an argument against fracking as such.

Typical tremor that can be caused by hydraulic fracturing is −2 on the Richter scale, a “quake” that is not felt at the surface, causes no damage, and can be measured only deep underground. Such quakes are occurring continuously throughout the Earth, fracking or no fracking.

It especially doesn’t make sense to be biased against man-made things, because they are deliberately made by a human mind, usually to promote human life. While man-made things can be bad, it is perverse to single out the man-made as bad per se. To be against the man-made as such is to have a bias against the mind-made, which is to be against the human mind, whose very purpose is to figure out how to transform our environment to meet our needs.

And just as we use computers to help solve computer problems, so we can use fossil fuels to help solve fossil fuel problems—to transform waste from a more dangerous form to a less dangerous form, or even to a benefit, by using energy and ingenuity.

In most realms, we accept and desire constant change. For example, you want the best phone with the best materials, regardless of whether those materials will be there in two hundred years and regardless of whether it would be more “renewable” to use two cups and a string.

There is no inherent limit to energy resources—we just need human ingenuity to be free to discover ways to turn unusable energy into usable energy. This opens up a thrilling possibility: the endless potential for improving life through ever growing energy resources helping create ever growing resources of every kind. This is the principle that explains the strong correlation between fossil fuel use and life expectancy, fossil fuel use and income, fossil fuel use and pretty much anything good: human ingenuity transforming potential resources into actual resources—including the most fundamental resource, energy.

We are not eating the last slice of pizza in the box or scraping the bottom of the barrel; we are standing on the tip of an endless iceberg.

The final point to make about consumption and efficiency and waste is that the most valuable thing we have is our time. If we want to talk about a resource, if human life is our standard, then the most important resource we should be focused on is our time. Using fossil fuels buys us time. It buys us more life. It buys us more opportunities. It buys us more resources. Fossil fuels are an amazing tool with which to create this ultimate form of wealth, this supreme resource: time to use our minds and our bodies to enjoy our lives as much as possible.

Someone had to do something, and I had control of exactly one person.

Anytime someone is oblivious to the positive and inclined toward the negative, he has a prejudice.

The prejudice, which is held consistently by our environmental thought leaders and inconsistently by the culture at large is the idea that nonimpact on nature is the standard of value. It is better known by a single color: Green.

He’s talking about something that could take someone who had never had access to a lightbulb for more than an hour, and give him all the light he needed for the rest of his life. He’s talking about something that would have given that hospital in The Gambia the power that it needed to save the two dead babies in the story, who could have been thriving eight-year-olds as I write this, instead of painful memories for would-be parents.

Prince Philip, former head of the World Wildlife Fund, has said, “In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.”.

“Until such time as Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, some of us can only hope for the right virus to come along.”.

Another reason we buy into Green is because we as a culture have never been fully comfortable with human industry. We’re taught that the pursuit of profit is wrong, that capitalism is wrong, and that we should feel guilty for our wealth and way of life.

We don’t want to “save the planet” from human beings; we want to improve the planet for human beings.

Making a moral case always means naming your standard—for us, human life.

There is only one way to defeat the environmentalists’ moral case against fossil fuels—refute its false central idea that fossil fuels destroy the planet. If we don’t refute that idea, we accept it, and if we accept that fossil fuels are destroying the planet, the only logical conclusion is to cease new development and slow down existing development as much as possible.

Fossil fuel companies, particularly oil and gas companies, proudly feature windmills on Web pages and annual reports, even though these are trivial to their bottom line and wildly uneconomic. This obviously implies that renewables are the goal, oil and gas being a temporarily necessary evil.

Not mentioning the word “oil” on home pages (this has at times been true of ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron). This implies that you’re ashamed of what you do and that your critics are right that oil is a self-destructive addiction.

Focusing attention on everything but your core product—community service initiatives, charitable contributions, et cetera. This implies that you’re ashamed of your core product.

Praising your attackers as “idealistic.” This implies that those who want your.

Praising your attackers as “idealistic.” This implies that those who want your destruction are pursuing a legitimate ideal.

Spending most of your time on the defensive. This implies that you don’t have something positive to champion.

Apologizing for your “environmental footprint.” This implies that there’s something wrong with the industrial development that is inherent in energy production.

Criticizing your opponents primarily for getting their facts wrong without refuting their basic moral argument. This implies that the argument is right but your opponents just need to identify your evils more precisely.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.”.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.” What you’re telling the world is that you are a necessary.

“Our product isn’t moral, but it’s something that we will need for some time as we transition to the ideal fossil fuel–free future.” What you’re telling the world is that you are a necessary evil.

That is, a revolution in fossil fuel technology occurred because our government didn’t know enough about it to demonize and ban it. This is not the kind of thing we want to depend on.

We are still arguably at the beginning of the fossil fuel age.

Wrote this book so you could hand it to the people who matter most to you—and so that you could take its ideas and make them your own, telling the people who matter to you how you think and feel.

What we are not taught is that the biggest risk is not using fossil fuels, and that using them is incredibly virtuous.

The unpopular but moral cause of our time is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are easy to misunderstand and demonize, but they are absolutely good to use. And they absolutely need to be championed.

Mankind’s use of fossil fuels is supremely virtuous—because human life is the standard of value, and because using fossil fuels transforms our environment to make it wonderful for human life.
