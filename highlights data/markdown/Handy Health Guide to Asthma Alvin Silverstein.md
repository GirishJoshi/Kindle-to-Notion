Some patients with allergies and moderate to severe asthma cannot control their condition with steroids. A drug called Xolair® might be the answer. This allergy medicine works to block the antibodies that react with allergens, thus preventing an allergic reaction. A doctor needs to inject Xolair® into the patient once or twice a month. This is a long-term medicine, not for quick relief. Patients who take it usually have fewer asthma attacks and need less medication to control their asthma symptoms.
