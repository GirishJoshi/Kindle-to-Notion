Elevated pore pressures pose a severe risk during drilling when hydrocarbons are present and place important constraints on the density of drilling mud (i.e. mud weights) used during drilling.

Elevated pore pressure also influences maximum hydrocarbon column height in some reservoirs as well as the leakage potential of reservoir-bounding faults.

Reductions in reservoir pore pressure with production (depletion) can cause significant deformation in a reservoir including compaction and permeability loss (especially in poorly consolidated and weak formations) and, perhaps counter-intuitively, induce faulting in some reservoirs in normal faulting regimes or the surrounding region (.

Pore pressure is defined as a scalar hydraulic potential acting within an interconnected pore space at depth. The.

Pore pressure is defined as a scalar hydraulic potential acting within an interconnected pore space at depth. The value of pore pressure at depth is usually described in relation to hydrostatic (or normal) pressure, the pressure associated with a column of water from the surface to the depth of interest.

Lithostatic pore pressure means that the pressure in the pores of the rock is equivalent to the weight of the overburden stress Sv. Because of the negligibly small tensile strength of rock (Chapter 4), pore pressure will always be less than the least principal stress, S3.

At relatively shallow depths (in this case to about 8000 ft), pore pressures are essentially hydrostatic, implying that a continuous, interconnected column of pore fluid extends from the surface to that depth.

Between 8000 ft and 11,000 ft pore pressure increases with depth very rapidly indicating that these formations are hydraulically isolated from shallower depths.

By 11,000 ft, pore pressures reach values close to that of the overburden stress, a condition sometimes referred to as hard overpressures.

Thus, it is always important to consider pore pressure (especially overpressure) in the context of the mechanisms responsible for it (see below) and local geologic conditions.

The easiest way to think about separate reservoir compartments is in the context of a series of permeable sands separated by impermeable shales.

The observation that a given reservoir can sometimes be compartmentalized and hydraulically isolated from surrounding formations has received a lot of attention over the past decades. The.

The observation that a given reservoir can sometimes be compartmentalized and hydraulically isolated from surrounding formations has received a lot of attention over the past decades.

Note that the individual sand reservoirs (shaded in the figure) are (i) separated by thick sequences of shale (not shaded), (ii) laterally discontinuous and (iii) frequently truncated by growth faults that provide up-dip closure (Alexander.

At a given depth, ongoing sedimentation increases the overburden stress which, in turn, will tend to cause compaction and porosity loss.

In a hydraulically open system, that is, in sufficiently permeable formations to be hydrologically connected to earth’s surface, the compaction and porosity loss associated with burial can be accommodated by fluid flow without excess pressure build up. This is apparently the case with the formations at depths less than 8000 ft.

However, in a low permeability formation (such as a shale), in confined sands isolated from other sands (such as with the formations deeper than 9000 ft in Figure 2.2), or in regions of such rapid sedimentation and compaction fluid expulsion cannot keep pace with the porosity loss. In this case, the increasing overburden stress driving compaction will cause increases in pore pressure as the overburden stress is carried by the pore fluid pressure.

Large accumulations (many km) of sediment over the past several million years. This sedimentation has caused compaction-induced pore pressures, which can reach extremely high values at great depth where extremely thick sequences of impermeable shales prevent drainage (Gordon and Flemings 1998). It should be noted that under conditions of severe undercompaction, porosity is quite high and the lithostatic gradient can be significantly below 23 MPa/km (1 psi/ft).

Centroid effects refer to the fact that relatively high pore pressure occurs at the top of a tilted sand body encased in shale.

Hydrocarbon column heights can result in substantial overpressure at the top of reservoir compartments, especially when appreciable amounts of buoyant gas.

Hydrocarbon column heights can result in substantial overpressure at the top of reservoir compartments, especially when appreciable amounts of buoyant gas are present.

Pressure in very weak shales is presumed to increase with a lithostatic gradient (as below 11,000 ft in Figure 2.2).

Aquathermal pressurizationrefers to a mechanism of overpressure generation stemming from the fact that as sediments are buried, they are heated. Temperature increases with depth in the earth due to heat produced by radioactive decay of crystalline basement rocks and heat flowing upward through the crust from the mantle. Because heating causes expansion of pore fluid at depth, in a confined and relatively incompressible rock matrix, expanding pore fluid pore would lead in theory to pressure increases.

Dehydration reactions associated with mineral diagenesis have been proposed as another mechanism that could lead to overpressure development.

Dehydration reactions associated with mineral diagenesis have been proposed as another mechanism that could lead to overpressure development. Smectite dehydration is a complex process (Hall 1993) but can lead to overall volume increases of both the rock matrix and the pore water system. One component of this process is the phase transition from montmorillonite to illite, which involves the expulsion of water from the crystal lattice of montmorillonite. The transition occurs at a temperature of about 100°C in the Gulf of Mexico, which is often correlative with the depth at which overpressures are observed to develop (Bruce 1984). The transition of anhydrite to gypsum is another dehydration reaction that can lead to overpressure development, but only at relatively shallow depths as the temperature at which this dehydration occurs is only about half that of the smectite–illite transition.

Hydrocarbon generation from the thermal maturation of kerogen in hydrocarbon source rocks is associated with marked increases in the volume of pore fluid and thus can also lead to overpressure generation. This.

Hydrocarbon generation from the thermal maturation of kerogen in hydrocarbon source rocks is associated with marked increases in the volume of pore fluid and thus can also lead to overpressure generation. This is true of the generation of both oil and gas from kerogen, although the latter process is obviously more important in terms of changes in the volume of pore fluids.

Direct measurement of pore pressure in relatively permeable formations is straightforward using a variety of commercially available technologies conveyed either by wireline (samplers that isolate formation pressure from annular pressure in a small area at the wellbore wall) or pipe (packers and drill-stem testing tools that isolate sections intervals of a formation). Similarly, mud weights are sometimes used to estimate pore pressure in permeable formations as they tend to take drilling mud if the mud pressure is significantly in excess of the pore pressure and produce fluids into the well if the converse is true.

Hydrostatic compression tests in which the applied stress is a uniform confining pressure and an impermeable membrane separates the pore volume of the rock from the confining pressure medium; and confined compaction tests in which the sample is subjected to an axial load while enclosed in a rigid steel cylinder that prevents lateral expansion of the sample. The data shown in Figure 2.13 were collected with the latter type of apparatus because it was thought to be more analogous to vertical loading in situ.

The onset of overpressure at depths greater than C is associated with a decrease in effective stress (the difference between the overburden and pore pressure) as well as a reversal of the increase in effective stress with depth.

The onset of overpressure at depths greater than C is associated with a decrease in effective stress (the difference between the overburden and pore pressure) as well as a reversal of the increase in effective stress with depth. This corresponds to anomalously high porosity at depth due to the anomalously high pressure.

The existence of anomalously high pore pressure at depth E can be inferred from the marked deviation from the normal compaction trend.

Assuming that the deviations from the normal compaction trends is evidence of overpressure.

A somewhat more direct approach to estimation of pore pressure from seismic interval velocity data is based on empirical correlations between P-wave velocity, Vp, S-wave velocity, Vs, both in units of km/s, mean effective stress, σ, in units of kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa), porosity, φ, and clay content, C, based on point counts of thin sections (0  C  1).

It is important to note that these methodologies apply best to shales because in sands and carbonates variations in cementation and diagenesis affect how they compact with depth such that relations such as equation (2.4) are not applicable (Burrus 1998). Second, because the method assumes that all shales in a given section follow the same compaction trend, variations of shale lithology with depth represent a decrease in effective stress, whereas they could result from a change of lithology. Third, there are a variety of opinions about how pressure, or stress, in the lab should be related to depth in the earth. Does hydrostatic confining pressure correspond to the overburden stress, Sv; or does a laterally confined uniaxial compression test correspond to Sv; or does hydrostatic confining pressure (or mean stress in a uniaxial compression test) correspond to mean stress in the earth, thus requiring knowledge (or estimates) of Shmin and SHmax?.

Compaction-based methods assume a prograde burial path in which effective stress monotonically increases with burial and time. Hence, in such regions, the deviation from the expected porosity at a given depth is evidence of anomalously high pore pressure. In.

Compaction-based methods assume a prograde burial path in which effective stress monotonically increases with burial and time. Hence, in such regions, the deviation from the expected porosity at a given depth is evidence of anomalously high pore pressure. In regions with a complex burial history and/or a history of pore pressure generation, the fundamental assumption of a monotonic increase of effective stress with depth and time is incorrect.

For example, induced micro-fracturing would tend to affect measurements of sonic velocity or formation resistivity logs but not bulk measurements such as density or neutron porosity.

A linearly elastic material (Figure 3.1a) is one in which stress and strain are linearly proportional and deformation is reversible.

Presence of water or oil in the pores of a rock will result in time-dependent deformation of any porous elastic (poroelastic) solid.

A porous rock saturated with fluid will exhibit poroelastic behavior. One manifestation of poreoelasticity is that the stiffness of a fluid-saturated rock will depend on the rate at which external force is applied. When force is applied quickly, the pore pressure in the rock’s pores increases because the pore fluid is carrying some of the applied stress and the rock behaves in an undrained manner. In other words, if stress is applied faster than fluid pressure can drain away, the fluid carries some of the applied stress and the rock is relatively stiff. However, when an external force is applied slowly, any increase in fluid pressure associated with compression of the pores has time to drain away such that the rock’s stiffness is the same as if no fluid was present. It is obvious that there is a trade-off between the loading rate, permeability of the rock and viscosity of the pore fluid, which is discussed further below.

The use of Mohr failure envelopes to represent rock failure as a function of confining stress and the ranges of strength values found for the rock types of interest here.

Empirical techniques for estimating rock strength from elastic moduli and porosity data obtained from geophysical logs.

This subject is principally of interest in hydraulic fracturing in formations and drilling-induced tensile wellbore failures that form in the wellbore wall.

Shear sliding and the frictional strength of faults.

Show how the shear strength of pre-existing faults constrains in situ stress magnitudes in the crust.

Show how the shear strength of pre-existing faults constrains in situ stress magnitudes in the crust. These constraints will be further refined by combining with direct measurements of the least principal stress through some form of hydraulic fracturing in Chapter 6 and.

Intentionally induce micro-seismicity to enhance permeability in low-permeability formations. Hence, knowing that relatively small perturbations of stress may induce fault slip is important in field development in many regions.

Slip on faults can be a source of wellbore instability (Chapters 10 and 12) and third, active faults provide efficient conduits for fluid flow in fractured reservoirs and influence the seal capacity of reservoir bounding faults (Chapter 11).

Hydrostatic compression tests (S1 = S2 = S3 = S0) are those in which a sample is subjected to a uniform confining pressure, S0. Such tests yield information about rock compressibility and the pressure at which pore collapse (irreversible porosity loss) occurs.

Uniaxial compressive tests (S1 > 0, S2 = S3 = 0) are those in which one simply compresses a sample axially (with no radial stress) until it fails at a value defined as the unconfined compressive strength (usually termed either the UCS or C0).

Uniaxial tension tests (S1 < 0, S2 = S3 = 0).

This type of test procedure tends to promote failure along pre-existing fractures or flaws that might be present in a sample.

Triaxial compression tests (S1 > S2 = S3 = S0) are the most common way of measuring rock strength under conditions that presumably simulate those at depth. Such tests are unfortunately named triaxial as there are only two different stresses of interest, the confining pressure S0 and the differential stress S1 − S0. The strength of the sample at a given confining pressure is the differential stress at which it fails. The confining pressure is held constant as the sample is loaded. As in the case of hydrostatic compression tests, it is relatively straightforward to include the effects of pore pressure in such tests.

Triaxial extension tests (S1 = S2 > S3 where S3 acts in an axial direction) can also be used to measure the compressive rock strength but are typically carried out only as part of specialized rock mechanical testing programs. One advantage of such tests is that they are useful for studying strength at low effective stress. A combination of triaxial compression and triaxial extension tests can be used to determine the importance of the intermediate principal stress, S2, on failure. As discussed below, the importance of S2 is often ignored.

Polyaxial, or true triaxial, tests (S1 > S2 > S3) are the only tests in which the three principal stresses are different. While these tests can most accurately replicate in situ conditions, such tests are extremely hard to conduct for several.

Thick-walled cylinder tests. In these tests a small axial hole is drilled along the axis of a cylindrical sample. These tests are done to determine the approximate strain around the axial hole at which failure is first noted. Such tests are done to support sand production studies such.

The failure of rock in compression is a complex process that involves microscopic failures manifest as the creation of small tensile cracks and frictional sliding on grain boundaries.

There is a coalescence of these microscopic failures into a through-going shear.

With the material essentially losing all of its strength when a through-going shear fault forms.

By rock strength we typically mean the value of the maximum principal stress at which a sample loses its ability to support applied stress.

Series of triaxial strength tests at different effective confining pressures defines the Mohr failure envelope which typically flattens as confining pressure increases.

Linear simplification of the Mohr failure envelope is usually referred to as Mohr–Coulomb failure.

It is universally observed in such tests that sample strength is seen to increase monotonically with effective confining pressure.

Because of this, it is common to present strength test results using Mohr circles and Mohr failure envelopes.

The basis for the Mohr circle construction is that it is possible to evaluate graphically the shear stress, τf, and effective normal stress (σn = Sn − Pp) on the fault that forms during the failure process in terms of the applied effective principal stresses σ1 and σ3,.

Conducting a series of triaxial tests defines an empirical Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope that describes failure of the rock at different confining pressures (Figure 4.2b.

Allowable stress states (as described by Mohr circles) are those that do not intersect the Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope.

Stress states corresponding to Mohr circles which exceed the failure line are not allowed because failure of the rock would have occurred prior to the rock having achieved such a stress state.

The slope of the Mohr failure envelopes for most rocks decreases as confining pressure increases,.

The unconfined compressive strength (termed the UCS or C0). One could also describe the linear Mohr failure line in terms of its intercept when σ3 = 0 which is called the cohesive strength (or cohesion), S0, as is common in soil mechanics. In.

While uniaxial tests are obviously the easiest way to measure C0, it is preferable to determine C0 by conducting a series of triaxial tests to avoid the axial splitting of the samples that frequently occurs during uniaxial tests and the test results are sensitive to the presence of pre-existing flaws in the samples.

Once a Mohr envelope has been obtained through a series of tests, one can find C0 by either fitting the envelope with a linear Mohr failure line and determining the uniaxial compressive strength graphically, or simply by measuring strength at many pressures and plotting the data.

Important concept to keep in mind when considering.

An important concept to keep in mind when considering rock strength is that while strong rocks have high cohesion and weak rocks have low cohesion, nearly all rocks have relatively high coefficients of internal friction.

In other words, the rocks with low cohesion (or low compressive strength) are weak at low mean stresses but increase in strength as the mean stress increases.

One exception to this is shales, which tend to have a somewhat lower value of μi. This is discussed below in the section.

The Mohr circle is drawn for a point around the wellbore. For weak rocks (low cohesion), when mud weight and pore pressure are equal, the wellbore wall fails in compression as the radial stress, σrr is equal to 0. Raising mud weight increases σrr and decreases σθθ, the hoop stress acting around the wellbore. This stabilizes the wellbore by reducing the size of the Mohr circle all around the circumference of the well. Figure 6.1.

Schematic illustration of how raising mud weight helps stabilize a wellbore. The Mohr circle is drawn for a point around the wellbore. For weak rocks (low cohesion), when mud weight and pore pressure are equal, the wellbore wall fails in compression as the radial stress, σrr is equal to 0. Raising mud weight increases σrr and decreases σθθ, the hoop stress acting around the wellbore. This stabilizes the wellbore by reducing the size of the Mohr circle all around the circumference of the well.

Linearized Mohr envelopes are shown schematically for a strong rock (high cohesive strength) and weak rock (low cohesive strength) with the same μi. As.

Linearized Mohr envelopes are shown schematically for a strong rock (high cohesive strength) and weak rock (low cohesive strength) with the same μi.

When one considers the stresses at the wall of a vertical wellbore that might cause compressive rock failure, the least principal stress, σ3, is usually the radial stress, σrr, which is equal to the difference between the mud weight, Pm, and the pore pressure, P0. The maximum principal stress driving failure of the wellbore wall is σθθ, the hoop stress acting parallel to the wellbore wall in a circumferential manner (Figure 6.1).

The cohesive strength of the rock is quite low, when the mud weight is exactly equal to the pore pressure (i.e. the mud weight is exactly balanced with the pore pressure), σθθ does not have to be very large to exceed the strength of the rock at the wellbore wall and cause wellbore failure because σrr = 0. However, if the mud weight exceeds the pore pressure, σrr increases and σθθ decreases, thus resulting in a more stable wellbore. This is discussed more thoroughly in Chapter 6. Of course, drillers learned this lesson empirically a century ago as the use of mud weight to stabilize wellbores is one of a number of considerations.

The presence of weak bedding planes in shaley rocks (or finely laminated sandstones or foliation planes in metamorphic rocks) can sometimes have a marked effect on rock strength.

The influence of weak bedding planes on rock strength is referred to as strength anisotropy.

The intact rock would have its normal strength which would control failure when slip on bedding planes did not occur and a lower strength, defined by the cohesion, Sw, and internal friction, μw, of the weak bedding planes which would apply.

The importance of weak bedding planes in shale is quite important in two case studies presented in Chapter 10. In northern South America, shales which have a UCS of about 10,000 psi (when measured normal to bedding) have very weak bedding planes with Sw = 300 psi and μw = 0.5 which greatly affects wellbore stability for wells at some trajectories to the steeply dipping bedding planes.

Core samples of overburden formations (where many wellbore instability problems are encountered) are almost never available for testing.

Numerous relations have been proposed that relate rock strength to parameters measurable with geophysical well logs.

The basis for these relations is the fact that many of the same factors that affect rock strength also affect elastic moduli and other parameters, such as porosity.

P-wave velocity, Vp, or equivalently, the travel time of compressional waves along the wellbore.

Unlike compressional strength, tensile strength does not seem to be dependent on simple effective stress, especially in low-porosity/low-permeability rocks.

Slip on faults is important in a number of geomechanical contexts. Slip on faults can shear well casings and it is well known that fluid injection associated with water flooding operations can induce earthquakes, for reasons explained below.

Some stress paths associated with reservoir depletion can induce normal faulting.

The role of pore pressure of frictional sliding is introduced via σn, the effective normal stress, defined as (Sn − Pp), where Sn is the normal stress resolved onto the sliding plane.

There are only two things you need to know about friction. It is always 0.6, and it will always make a monkey out of you.

There are two things you need to know about life. It is shorter than you think and it will always make a monkey out of you.

In other words, as pore pressure gets higher and higher, faulting occurs with smaller and smaller differences between the maximum and minimum effective principal stress.

When stress magnitudes are controlled by the frictional strength of faults, as pore pressure increases, the maximum size of the Mohr circle decreases.

Hence, the Mohr circle gets smaller as pore pressures increases.

As pore pressure increases (and effective stress decreases), the difference between the maximum and minimum effective principal stress.

The first point worth emphasizing is that when the state of stress at depth is limited by the frictional strength of pre-existing faults, the ratio of effective stresses remains the same.

The first point worth emphasizing is that when the state of stress at depth is limited by the frictional strength of pre-existing faults, the ratio of effective stresses remains the same (in accord with equations 4.45, 4.46 and 4.47) as pore pressure changes (as.

Is convenient to be able to simply estimate the range of possible stress states at any given depth and pore pressure given that stress in the crust is limited by the frictional strength of faults.

Allowable stress states are shown for hydrostatic pore pressure (Figure 4.31a) and significant overpressure (Figure 4.31b). The.

The fact that SHmax  Shmin requires all possible stress states to be above a diagonal line of unit slope.

The vertical and horizontal lines intersecting at SHmax = Shmin = Sv separate the stress fields associated with normal (N), strike-slip (SS) and reverse (RF) faulting stress environments as defined by Anderson.

The vertical line in the lower left of the polygon indicates the lowest value of Shmin possible in a normal faulting environment as predicted using equation (4.45). In other words, for the value of Shmin shown by this line, a Mohr circle would exactly touch a frictional failure envelope with a slope of 0.6. Similarly, the horizontal line defining the top of the polygon corresponds the value of SHmax at which reverse faulting would occur (equation 4.47). The diagonal line bounding the polygon on the upper left corresponds to the value of SHmax at which strike-slip faulting would occur for a given value of Shmin (equation 4.46). Thus, in every case, the stress at depth must be somewhere within the stress polygon.

The fact that elevated pore pressure reduces the difference between principal stresses at depth as.

When pore pressure is elevated, all three principal stresses are close in magnitude to the vertical stress and relatively small changes in the stress field can cause a transition from one style of faulting to another. Moos and Zoback (1993) hypothesize that because of elevated pore pressure at depth in the vicinity of Long Valley caldera, the style of faulting goes from NF/SS faulting on one side of the caldera to RF/SS faulting on the other side as the direction of the horizontal principal stresses change.

The stress polygon shown in Figure 4.31a permits a very wide range of stress values at depth and would not seem to be of much practical use in limiting stress magnitudes. However, as extended leak-off tests.

The stress polygon shown in Figure 4.31a permits a very wide range of stress values at depth and would not seem to be of much practical use in limiting stress magnitudes. However, as extended leak-off tests or hydraulic fracturing tests are often available to provide a good estimate of the least principal stress (Chapter 6), the polygon is useful for estimating the possible range of values of SHmax.

One also has information about the existence of either compressive or tensile wellbore failures, one can often put relatively narrow (and hence, useful) bounds on possible stress states at depth.

The flow rate through a fracture in response to a pressure gradient will be proportional to the cube of the product of the length times the difference between the fluid pressure inside the fracture (acting to open it) and the least principal stress normal to it (acting to close it). This.

Following initiation, the pressure is expected to drop and the fractures to close.

Hence, only extremely small fracture apertures would be expected, having little effect on flow.

Wellbore imaging devices make it possible to obtain direct information on the distribution and orientation of fractures and faults encountered at depth. One family of wellbore image tools is collectively known as the ultrasonic borehole televiewer (BHTV). Such tools scan the wellbore wall with a centralized rotating ultrasonic.

Position around the well (with respect to north in this case) is shown on the abscissa and depth is shown on the ordinate. The amplitude of the reflected pulse is displayed as brightness.

Position around the well (with respect to north in this case) is shown on the abscissa and depth is shown on the ordinate. The amplitude of the reflected pulse is displayed as brightness. In such a display, planar fractures (or bedding planes) cutting the wellbore (Figure 5.3c) have a sinusoidal appearance (Figure 5.3d) resulting from the low amplitude of the reflected acoustic pulse along the intersection of the fault plane and wellbore wall.

Although wellbore image data only provide information on the apparent aperture of faults where they are intersected by a wellbore, empirical relations have been proposed that attempt to relate fault length to aperture (e.g. Gudmundsson 2000) and enable one to develop ideas about fracture networks from wellbore image data.

Thus, the apparent aperture is always going to be larger than the actual aperture.

One obvious limitation of imaging tools is that they will undersample fractures and faults whose planes are nearly parallel to the wellbore axis.

One obvious limitation of imaging tools is that they will undersample fractures and faults whose planes are nearly parallel to the wellbore axis. This is most easily visualized for a vertical well – the probability of intersecting horizontal fractures in the formation is one, but the probability of intersecting vertical fractures is essentially zero.

Dip is measured from a horizontal plane and is positive to the right, when looking in the strike direction.

Dip direction is often used instead of strike to define fracture orientation.

Measured from north, dip direction is the azimuth of the projection of a vector in the plane of the fault that is normal to the strike direction and points down dip. Slip on the fault is also defined by a vector, which can be thought of as the scratch on the footwall, resulting from relative motion of the hanging wall.

The concentration of stress around wellbores can lead to compressive failures known as stress-induced breakouts and/or tensile failure of the wellbore wall that we will refer to as drilling-induced tensile.

The concentration of stress around wellbores can lead to compressive failures known as stress-induced breakouts and/or tensile failure of the wellbore wall that we will refer to as drilling-induced tensile wall fractures.

Breakouts are quite common in many wells and yield important information about both stress orientation and magnitude.

The processes that control the initiation of tensile wall fractures are important for understanding the initiation of hydraulic fractures.

Hydrofracs are distinguished from tensile wall fractures in that they propagate from the wellbore into the far field, away from the wellbore stress concentration.

The concept of stress concentrations around a vertical well, how this stress concentration can lead to compressive and tensile wall failures and how such failures are used to determine the orientation of the horizontal principal stresses that exist in situ.

The determination of the least principal stress, S3, from hydrofracs in reservoirs or extended leak-off tests at casing set points. As S3  Shmin in normal and strike-slip faulting areas.

When one principal stress is vertical, Sv is obtained by integration of density logs as discussed in Chapter.

With knowledge of the orientation of the horizontal principal stresses obtained from wellbore failures and the magnitude Shmin, determination of the complete stress tensor requires only the magnitude of SHmax to be determined.

These include the way in which the presence of weak bedding planes can induce anisotropic rock strength.

Causes the stress trajectories to bend in such a way as to be parallel and perpendicular to the wellbore wall because it is a free surface which cannot sustain shear traction.

This is illustrated by the bunching up of stress trajectories at the azimuth of Shmin, which indicates strongly amplified compressive stress. In contrast, the spreading out of stress trajectories at the azimuth of SHmax indicates a decrease in compressive stress.

The most reliable way to observe wellbore breakouts is through the use of ultrasonic image logs that were described in Chapter 5.

This is because as ΔP increases, σθθ decreases and σrr increases such that the size of the Mohr circle (Figure 6.3b) decreases markedly in the area of the wellbore wall subjected to most compressive stress. This demonstrates why increasing mud weight can be used to stabilize wellbores, a subject to be considered at length in Chapter 10.

Drilling induced tensile fractures are not expected to propagate more than a cm from the wellbore wall.

Thus, the formation of drilling-induced tensile fractures will not lead to a hydraulic fracture propagating away from the wellbore (which could cause lost circulation) unless the mud weight exceeds the least principal stress. In the case of deviated wells,.

Breakouts are wellbore enlargements caused by stress-induced failure of a well occurring 180° apart. In vertical wells breakouts occur at the azimuth of minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) and generally (when analyzed properly) show a remarkably consistent orientation within a given well or field. One exception to this is localized perturbations of the stress field due to slip on active faults discussed in Chapter 11.

First, drilling-induced tensile fractures occur in vertical wells only when there is a significant difference between the two horizontal stresses. In fact, it is straightforward to show that the conditions for the occurrence of drilling-induced tensile fractures around a vertical wellbore in the absence of excess mud weight or wellbore cooling are essentially identical to the values of Shmin and SHmax associated with a strike-slip faulting regime in frictional equilibrium.

Breakouts form in the area around a wellbore where the stress concentration exceeds the rock strength.

There are other complexities affecting the formation of breakouts that will arise when we consider wellbore stability in Chapter 10: the effect of rock strength anisotropy that results from the presence of weak bedding planes in shale; the possibility that the strength of materials approach utilized here oversimplifies the breakout formation process; the relation between mud chemistry, rock strength and wellbore stability; other modes of breakout formation; and penetration of mud into fractured rock surrounding a wellbore.

Arriving at practical solutions to many problems in geomechanics requires knowledge of the magnitude and orientation of all three principal stresses.

In normal and strike-slip faulting environments,S3 is equivalent to Shmin. In reverse faulting environments, S3 is equivalent to Sv. Methods for determination of Shmin from Poisson’s ratio (obtained from P- and S-wave sonic logs) are based on questionable physical and geologic assumptions.

Suffice it to say at this point that direct measurement of the least principal stress through some form of hydraulic fracturing is the only reliable method known that is practical to use in wells and boreholes at any appreciable depth. One can determine the magnitude of the least principal stress from a micro-frac, a very small-scale hydraulic fracture induced only to measure stress at a particular depth, usually at a specific depth through perforations in cemented casing.

Production. One can also determine the least principal stress from a leak-off test: after the casing has been cemented in place at a given depth and the well is drilled a short distance (usually 10–20 ft) the open section of the well is pressurized to the point that a hydraulic fracture is created, and the magnitude of the least principal stress can be determined.

Presented a compelling physical argument that hydraulic fractures in the earth will always propagate perpendicular to the orientation of the least principal stress, S3. Because the work done to open a Mode I fracture a given amount is proportional to the product of the stress acting perpendicular to the fracture plane times the amount of opening (i.e. work is equal to force times distance), hydraulic fractures will always propagate perpendicular to the least principal stress because it is the least energy configuration.

In strike-slip and normal faulting environments where S3  Shmin, hydraulic fracture (and dike) propagation will be in a vertical plane perpendicular to Shmin (and parallel to SHmax). In reverse faulting environments where S3  Sv, hydraulic fracture propagation will be in a horizontal plane.

The wellbore pressure required to initiate a tensile fracture is greater than the least principal stress so that the pressure drops after fracture initiation.

The LOP is not reached, a limit test, or formation integrity test (LT, or FIT), is said to have been conducted. Such tests merely indicate that at the maximum pressure achieved, the fluid pressure did not propagate away from the wellbore wall, either because the maximum wellbore pressure did not exceed the least principal stress or was not sufficient to initiate a fracture of the wellbore wall in the case of an open-hole test.

An even better measure of the least principal stress is obtained from the instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) which is measured after abruptly stopping flow into the well, because any pressure associated with friction due to viscous pressure losses disappears.

Influence of weak bedding planes on wellbore stability as they introduce anisotropic rock strength which can affect the stability of wells drilled at particular angles to the bedding planes.

By reactive shales we mean those that chemically react with drilling mud in such a way as to weaken a formation leading to wellbore instability.

We illustrate the importance of this in two very different cases: one where near-vertical wells were being drilled in steeply dipping strata and the other where highly deviated wells were being drilled through relatively flat-laying shales.

The first is how reservoir depletion and drawdown (related to the rate of production) affect open-hole completions in wells of different orientations.

An unstable well is one in which excess breakout formation produces so much failed material from around the wellbore that the total volume of cuttings and failed material in the hole cannot be circulated out by mud circulation.

Hence, a breakout with limited breakout width, 60° in the example shown in Figure 10.1a, produces a failed zone of limited size. Literally thousands of near-vertical wells have been.

The most unstable orientations (horizontal wells drilled parallel to either SHmax or Shmin) require a mud weight that balances the pore pressure.

For the case of strike-slip faulting (SHmax = 105 MPa, Sv = 70 MPa, Shmin = 45 MPa) shown in Figure 10.4b, it is clear that for all orientations except highly deviated wells parallel to SHmax, mud weights of 40–42 MPa (corresponding to 1.28 sg or 10.7 ppg) are required to achieve the desired degree of stability. As the stresses are both larger in magnitude and more anisotropic than for the normal faulting case, the well trajectory has a more important effect on wellbore stability. For the case of reverse faulting (SHmax = 145 MPa, Shmin = 125 MPa, Sv = 70 MPa) shown in Figure 10.4c, still higher mud weights are needed at all wellbore orientations because of the very high stress magnitudes. The most unstable wells (i.e. those requiring the highest mud weights) are near vertical (deviations <30°) and require 52 MPa (1.62 sg or 13.7 ppg) to achieve the desired degree of wellbore stability. Lower mud weights can be used to achieve the desired degree of stability whenever the well trajectories are more highly deviated. The most stable wells are those that are highly deviated and drilled in the direction of SHmax.

At a certain depth, the well could not be drilled any further (and did not reach its intended target reservoir) because mud weights sufficient to stabilize the well exceeded the least principal stress. In other words, as the operator increased the mud weight in an attempt to stabilize failure of the wellbore wall, circulation was lost because the mud weight exceeded the least principal stress.

The reason drilling direction is so important in this case study is that at the depth of interest there is a significant difference between the maximum and minimum horizontal principal stresses. While Shmin is well below Sv, as expected in this area of active normal faulting, SHmax was found to be approximately equal to Sv.

In this case study for an offshore Gulf of Mexico well, near vertical wells and those deviated to the northwest or southeast require unrealistically high mud weights (i.e. in excess of the frac gradient) to achieve an acceptable degree of wellbore stability. In contrast, wells that are highly deviated to the southwest or northeast are relatively stable.

The most stable drilling direction is parallel to SHmax (100°/280°) with a high deviation (near-horizontal). The horizontal well drilled at an azimuth.
