Women do not like it when they feel like a man is trying to “get” something from them.

The more you value yourself, the more women will value you. If you respect yourself, then others will respect you — it’s that simple.

It is very attractive to a woman when a man is unaffected by a woman’s actions and emotions. Be a mountain, not a leaf in the wind, as they say.

If you are overly needy or clingy, you will lose the girl. You must have something more important going on in your life than the woman — your purpose, your goals, your ambition.

The goal of having complete self-reliance in your life is to remove the need for validation from others and to be less invested in others than you are in yourself.

Let me tell you, and emphasize it, if you are unhappy in this moment, no one did it to you. You are doing it to yourself, even in this moment. Something unfortunate may have happened to you in the past, but you are the one who continuously punishes yourself and suffers as a result.

The ultimate goal of The Grounded Man is to become self-reliant; to become your true self, to love all of your flaws and imperfections, and be one hundred percent happy with who you are in this moment.

And further, I want to make this crystal clear: no woman will ever make you happy if you are first not happy with yourself. Not being true to yourself will only create pain in your life, for most you will have sacrificed what makes you happy in order to please society, friends, or family.

Happy. And further, I want to make this crystal clear: no woman will ever make you happy if you are first not happy with yourself.

“A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”.

Become a more interesting person. Make your opinions known. Try things most people haven’t done. Go places where others haven’t been. Try new things, do things differently, read more books. Life is meant to be lived, not watched through a 55-inch LCD screen.

Read the classics of philosophy by Aristotle, Seneca, and Epictetus. Listen to different styles of music and learn to appreciate art.

Travel more. You need to experience the world to be fully grounded. Traveling is, in fact, the fastest way to become a more grounded man. All of the interesting men I’ve met have traveled the world extensively.

Adopt the mindset of ABL, which stands for: always be learning. Wherever you are there can be something to learn. Whether you’re in traffic, walking to your car, or in the gym working out. I’m not just talking about listening to a podcast or an audio program, but I’m talking about viewing the world through the lens of a student. Someone with fresh, innocent eyes. This one trick will make the world a much more interesting place, and boring locations suddenly become areas of pleasure.

Although a woman wants to be the only important thing in a man’s life, at her core, she doesn’t really want to be. She’ll never tell you this, but she doesn’t want to be the main reason why you get up in the morning. Rather, she wants you to live your purpose, your values, and have your own life outside of hers. She wants to come along for the adventure that you bring to her.

Start with one to three friends (or even acquaintances) and decide on a fun social activity like football night, a BBQ, game night, sushi night, a cocktail party, a pool party, or just something fun.

When you step into your masculine, you open the doors for women to fall into their feminine. This is where the deepest levels of attraction can grow.

You are neither inferior nor superior to those around you, and you make others feel at ease around you, which in turn allows women to feel safe and fall into their feminine in your presence. You are not trying to “get” something from them and you are not seeking validation from anyone. You are being authentic and acting from your core.

Masculine polarity is freedom. First achieve freedom from the external, where you need nothing outside of yourself. Then, you’ll come to realize that you are freedom. It is your true self as a man to be free.

You lose dominance when you are stuck in your logical mind and fall into paralysis by switching into analysis mode, asking: what’s the right way? How do you do this? Is it the right time? No, don’t do this, as it leads to inaction and indecisiveness.

Everything you do should be moving toward the life you want (better health, wealth, relationships, personal growth). Anything other than your values should be removed from your life. Eliminate what is unnecessary and do more of what is necessary in your life, and you will see a significant spike in your development as a man.

“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi.

Too often, we pass up on life’s opportunities because we feel like we’re not ready for them. Life is presenting you with opportunities every day, but we prefer to stay in our comfort zone instead of taking action and stepping into the unknown.

Anything you want that’s going to get you closer toward your goals, you must believe you’re enough for it. If you see a girl, then go talk to her. If you want to ask for her phone number, then do it. If you want to kiss a girl then do it. If you want to ask a girl to be your girlfriend, then do it.

These questions and thoughts are lies you tell yourself to avoid the pain of rejection. You are enough and it doesn’t take anything more than a Grounded Man to create attraction with a woman.

Always remember you are of value to women. Not high or low value — no, you are of value. You need to express yourself and share who you are with others because this is what you offer to the world … you. Girls will wonder, “Why isn’t he trying to get me?” They’ll ask, “What’s this guy about?” You should trust that that attraction is building up inside of the girl.

When you love yourself, you take care of yourself, respect yourself, and do not allow second-class behavior from others. Also,.

When you love yourself, you take care of yourself, respect yourself, and do not allow second-class behavior from others. Also, you start believing in yourself, forgive those who have wronged you, and take full responsibility for your life. If you don’t love yourself, you’re never going to find the healthy, incredible, trusting relationship you deserve.

Imagine someone you love being disrespected and how fast you would stand up for them. Why is it we don’t have the same instinct for ourselves?.

Life is what happens when you’re planning for the future,.

Life is what happens when you’re planning for the future, so love yourself in this moment right now.

The ridiculous thing is that while you’re wasting your time wishing you were someone else, there’s someone else wishing he were you.

You are the golden prize. You are enough. You love yourself. You will not accept second-class behavior from anyone or you will simply walk away.

Every time you open your mouth, you are giving a woman the opportunity to experience your value system and a unique set of life experiences. You offer things unique only to you, so let your light shine onto others like it’s a best picture movie.

This goes back to having fun. If you’re having fun, she’s having fun. If you’re feeling insecure about the interaction, she’s feeling insecure and can’t trust you. Without trust, there’s simply no attraction.

When you’re free of outcome, you’re dictating the rhythm of the interaction and others are reacting to you. Be happy doing what you want to say and do. Enjoy talking, hearing yourself, become less attached to the outcome, and attach yourself to your own actions.

Embrace the feeling of not knowing what to do next and of not knowing how this is going to end. Just let go and enjoy the process. There is nothing for you to lose. Be present.

Women will say they want one thing, but do something completely different or irrational. So watch what women act on, not what they say they want.

She wants a man who can protect her, lead her and help her get through life easier, because life is hard.

Such as being unclean, overweight, dressing unfashionably, or not grooming.

This is why it’s very important to befriend her friends and be a trustworthy Grounded Man.

Don’t aim to make every woman like you, instead focus on liking yourself for taking action.

If you’re worried about what other people think about you when you take action in public, then this points out to another, and bigger problem in your life — that you really need to stop caring about what other people think about you. The opinions of others will mean less and less to you the more you go out and meet people. Especially as you start to get more results and you become the rare breed of man who is taking action and moving toward what he wants in life.

When you see a girl you like, go plant your feet right in front of her and talk to her.

When you see a girl you like, go plant your feet right in front of her and talk to her. You will not let any opportunities go right past you because of fear.

You can’t rationalize that you’re working on other areas of your life before you can start interacting with girls and taking action.

Have you ever been out with your friends and you’re firing on all cylinders where everything you say is funny, on point, your rhythm and timing is perfect. Basically, you’re on cloud nine and guess what, you’re sober too.

You have to take responsibility for your state because no one else is going to do it for you. Don’t wait for the DJ to make it better, don’t wait for the alcohol to kick in and don’t wait for your friends to do anything because it’s not coming. You have to get yourself into state on your own. Enter Nero Linguistic Programming which is the relationship between brain, language and the body. You can use this NLP technique: anchor a move like clapping, squeeze your fist, bump your head,.

You have to take responsibility for your state because no one else is going to do it for you.

And, remember, the internal mindset should be: you’re enough, you’re self-amused, freedom from outcome, love yourself, you have massive value; just have a blast and care less about others’ reactions.

“Understand: people judge you by appearances, the image you project through your actions, words, and style. If you do not take control of this process, then people will see and define you the way they want to, often to your detriment. You might think that being consistent with this image will make others respect and trust you, but in fact it is the opposite — over time you seem predictable and weak. Consistency is an illusion anyway — each passing day brings changes within you. You must not be afraid to express these evolutions.  The powerful learn early in life that they have the freedom to mold their image, fitting the needs and moods of the moment. In this way, they keep others off balance and maintain an air of mystery. You must follow this path and find great pleasure in reinventing yourself, as if you were the author writing your own drama” ~ 50 Cent.

You want to interact with a woman you’re interested in, in a man to woman type of way as early as possible to be clear in your intentions. Don’t be afraid to show or tell her that you like her — the girl knows what’s going on. Saying things like, “Do you know what time it is?” or “I’m looking for this place … do you know where it is?” doesn’t help at all. It’s like when someone is lying to you, and you know it. At first, it isn’t a big deal, but because they keep lying, it irritates you even more.

Never approach from behind a girl because this will scare her and when a girl is scared she’s not feeling attraction she’s in a defensive state. It’s either side to side or stand in front of her.

“I actually don’t know what to say right now, but I know I want to talk to you,”.

A lot of guys talk very low and boring, or they’re speaking from their nose which comes across as being weak or timid. You want to project from the chest and stomach and develop a deep, resonating voice. Add a bit of charisma, and this will hold people’s attention longer and create attraction. You can really separate yourself from the masses with a deeper voice, some charisma, and strong, confident eye contact.

Listen, women want you to succeed. They want a confident, fun, Grounded Man to introduce themselves to her. Be the man she so badly wants to meet.

There are too many variables to consider: her upbringing, personality, sense of humor, culture, age, how she’s feeling that day, which go into whether or not she likes you.

You cannot take responsibility for what you can’t control. As long as you have good intentions, you win. There is nothing more of what you could do anyways, so let go of the outcome. You should feel good because you are taking action with your own intentions and living in alignment to what you value — personal growth.

Your opener should get her attention to focus on you.

Women feel a lot safer with you when they know you don’t have an agenda. So, engage her emotions.

If you don’t take a risk and make her invest into the interaction, then you will be overly invested, which may come off as trying too hard.

Whatever she says, it can’t affect you. What I mean, is don’t get butt-hurt or take anything personal because some girls might say mean stuff.

They talk so much that they aren’t even listening to the girl, they’re thinking of what to say next, believing the longer they talk to this girl, the better off they’ll be.

Each line they think, “Oh, that just bought me at least ten to twenty more seconds with her. Now I’ll think of what to say next.”.

80/20 first 2 minutes (you talking the majority of the time) 50/50 after 2 minutes (the conversation balances out) 20/80 after 5 minutes (she’s talking the majority of the time).

When she talks to you, she is investing into the conversation and the more she invests, the more she will comply with you in the future when you ask for her phone number or to move to another venue.

That’s really all there is to it. It is not about you having the perfect thing to say the entire time. It’s really what you do after the opener, that matters.

If you ever feel like you’re doing all the work and not getting much back from a woman, that’s because you are doing all the work, and you’re not allowing her to participate in the conversation.

If you ever feel like you’re doing all the work and not getting much back from a woman, that’s because you are doing all the work, and you’re not allowing her to participate in the conversation. You’re trying to be the masculine and the feminine at the same time, and it just doesn’t work and never will.

A lot of younger women actually aren’t socially good at talking to strangers.

You kick the ball to her and she needs to kick it back.

Since they think they need to impress the girl with some witty lines to win her over.

You can look at her like, “Well, I just did the hard part, what have you got?” kind of look.

Don’t look anywhere else outside of the material she’s giving you.

Stop looking for something you like or have in common.

As more guys approach to talk to her, she’ll wonder what she did wrong for you to leave early, and be happy if she sees you again, and will likely be a completely different person the second time around.

“Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.”.

If she’s from San Diego, “Oooh, really? I hate San Diego… I’m out of here …” turn around and your arm is slightly pushing her away in a fun way.

Have a strong vocal tonality too: talk down, not up. Talk as if you were a king or if you owned the venue you are at.

“Star Wars, because it’s about the hero’s journey of a common man who rises to the call to adventure, overcomes extreme challenges, and transforms into a hero who saves the world from evil. I can relate to this story because I’m in a similar place in my life where the odds are stacked up against me, but I’m working really hard to get to where I want to be in life …”.

Meanwhile, as she’s making you wait, she could meet a lover type of guy who takes her from you. A lover is more exciting, spontaneous, and the “it-just-happened” type of guy.

“Hey, let’s exchange phone numbers real quick.”.

Sometimes girls will test you while exchanging phone numbers with, “What’s my name?” If you don’t know, you screwed up, and some girls can get really pissed off and leave.

Some guys want to text and chat with a girl forever and ever. This does nothing except reduce your value over time.

“Whoa, I just saw your twin at the mall!”.

“So, you fainted from the excitement of getting my texts? Totally understandable. Text me when you wake up : )”.

“Your responses are too fast for me. Slow down, speedy!”.

Stop making a woman a priority in your life when you are just her option.

Just because she may be an attractive woman doesn’t mean you need to chase her around the world! Let her go.

You have to be willing to respect yourself enough to walk away from a woman that isn’t interested in you.

You have to be willing to respect yourself enough to walk away from a woman that isn’t interested in you. She loses respect for you more and more when you put up with her second class behavior to you.

The second you show any signs of weakness, like being too needy, clingy, available, or jealous is the second she starts second guessing you as a potential boyfriend.

When you meet a girl who makes it completely un-motivating to meet other women, then you may have found a girl worth investing more time and energy into.

Enrich your own life yourself. People are so focused on external validation it makes me sick!.

Don’t get why in this day and age there are still people eating fast food, drinking soda, and smoking cigarettes. It’s proven that this stuff will kill you faster, and while you are alive, it makes your life miserable with less physical, emotional, and creative energy which are all things needed to build an amazing life.

Someone spent their entire life learning some great skills or lessons, and they wrote it into a formatted book so you can easily read it for ten dollars or less. It’s a steal. Why aren’t you taking more advantage of this?.

Get a mentor. You can’t do life alone. A mentor is someone who has the result you want in life. Get a mentor for different aspects of your life such as your health, wealth, relationships, and personal growth. It will save you money and time, two valuable things in the world.

The grass isn’t greener on the other side, it’s greener where you water it.

I hope you can tell so far in this book that so much of becoming good with women is really about becoming good with yourself.

You can’t beg her to stay when she wants to leave and be somewhere else. Don’t ever change just to impress someone.

There is nothing more attractive than a grounded man who knows what he wants, knows how to get it and is working towards that every day.

“a Grounded Man equals a happy life”.

True happiness comes from within, not from someone else.

Without trust there is no respect, and without respect there is no empathy, and without empathy there is no relationship.

“Listen, I think we need to be more loving to each other. We would really benefit from creating that environment together, because we both deserve this and need it in order to be happy and grow together.”.

The root of failure in relationships is usually a fear of honesty.

“The greatest regret in life is being what others would want you to be, rather than being yourself.”.

We cannot connect with someone who has no flaws and is perfect.

Vulnerability builds self-esteem because you realize the more you share, the more you connect with those who matter. Relationships become easier. Dating becomes easier. Friendships become easier. Life becomes easier.

“You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.”.

When someone gives you their time, they are giving you a portion of their life they will never get back. It’s one of the most precious gifts you can receive: your attention.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest, and the first to move forward is the happiest. Always choose love. Relationships are.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest,.

Remember the first to apologize is the bravest, the first to forgive is the strongest, and the first to move forward is the happiest.

You have to understand rejection isn’t always about you. You have no idea what’s going on in a woman’s life, so don’t take things personally.

Don’t get significance from self-pity and attention from others.
